Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
The Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, the middle class jobs die," Ellison said, a Democrat Minnesota and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, I proudly present the Employee Department Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organization of unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigenwerklich set forces.
The supplement to the National Labor Law Act in order to create a way for discriminating workers to organize a union representation in order to complain to justice before a civil court - and to obtain damages or criminal obligations - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors suggest their bill, the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that the unions exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and adhere to labor rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom, and the law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions revealed a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed on association and joint negotiation and action."
When the United States occupy Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and their voice should rise in the new nation, the Germans suffered a clause explicitly, "The right to set up associations to the labor and economic conditionsSaving and improving is guaranteed every single and every profession or commerce.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it is zero and void;Aiming measures are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Chairman of the International Human Rights Commission, which was designed by the general explanation of human rights, as they were adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors adopted a guarantee that "Everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect his interests. "
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries how to form civilian and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as equivalent partners with companies and government agencies -Must.
After these rights in America under shelling, it is actually very manner to face the American ideal again in mind again, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and get married in a free and open society.
Like Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but it enlarged.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work in a miraculous way has created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forgot these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story is reminiscent, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made great in the past and to redeem the promise of democracy.
Richter temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A US federal judge stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, from the lawyer to say that it had probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was collected by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to come into force on Sept. 1st., would force doctors to force abortions, a patient supervision in a hospital within a radius of 30 milesto acquire your practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legally abortions while they apply for such law.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work legally, as they seek to obtain these rights," written federal judges John DeGrevernelles in his verdict.
Within a month, a hearing will be recognized for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion Envelopes welcomed the decision to make the recent in a number of judgments against similar measures and said doctors so much time to obtain hospitalization rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a surprising law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, which subles on behalf of three of the five clinics of the statehad to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, which did not affiliate the action and had also requested intention rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with dishes recently explained such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional.
Keys of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clubs remaining in the state for closure, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion Envelopes and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that enforcement rights of physicians require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents comply with that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs in Louisiana abortions has patient's rights, shared the center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to carry out any abortions more, this doctor would no longer carry out the surgery for his safety, the group said.
In their argumentation against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors because of the implementation of abortions, while their applications for patient injection would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates through ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video home online for their mother, who died on ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, which found ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent five years after the diagnosis were still alive.
The research director Susan Jordan from the Qimr Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Small study: New medicines could slow down pulmonary and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr.Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already further advanced to the diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with higher probability of ovarian cancer, dr.Jordan a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to oppose the distances a bit, it suggested as a possible remedy to enhance the service of federated physicians to give specialists the opportunity to provide women poeter at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr.Jordan said that the study revealed a poor long-term survival at women in ovarian cancer, regardless of the geographical status and underlined the need for better treatment and pension strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave learned a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling homeowners
The decline along with a reinforced sinking of the number of homeowners under 35 years could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers reported to a study of HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "Kernalgegruppe for Garden Products"reach.
The report states that tenants give an average of 55 percent of the amount, which spend people with their own home for their garden.
The increase of people who live in highly urbanized areas without gardens, asphalt the popular processes, bergies for parking purposes and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, which is estimated to be 5 billion £ annually implemented on sale.
In the Greater London, in which over a period of 6 years, the share of householders has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest spending on garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can not pull plants.
Guy Barter, chef garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardening is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of Garden Detail due to rising homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the middle of the 90s.
He predicted an improved market situation for better weather for unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year for this year.
Turkey orders US diplomat due to espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has incorporated the country's own US diplomats to provide information of a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Vice-Prime Minister Bülent said that the service provider of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine of the Spiegel and the Online Magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a main activity area for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played the importance of the report and said that all major countries spied out each other.
An earlier report that also the most important intelligence service of Germany Ankara had targeted, caused significantly angry reactions of the Turkish government.
Police chief of Magaluf of corruption charged
The prosecutors presented on Friday the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca proofs for extortion through police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief of Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption allegations of business people and barbsides in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Main Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was used after corruption allegations against several business people from Punta Ballena, the road in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are taken.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented the office of the public prosecutor for corruption of Mallorca on Friday evidence of blackmail through police officers and employees of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption compressors and are interviewed by a judge together with Navarro.
The National Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners stated that the vettern economy of the authorities have serious impact on their business.
"It's no more money to make money, it's about survival," said one of the business people the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral youtube video, in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who felt 24 men during a fluff of fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the misdirent behavior of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pubation tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio was taken, was forced for a year for closing, while Playhouse and the Kneiporganizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of € 55,000 ($ 73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is popular with young British vacationers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from a balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
Spring has brought South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 pm, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night of Sunday.
The last precipitate was the result of a number of short, stormy showers, including a cast, which started just before 8 pm and cared for almost 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had taken for an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city were back on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 ° C.
The bottom weather conditions probably led to the belated landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have ended up after 7.30 pm, but was hit by a shear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
Wind teasers reached about 50 km / h at the ground at the floor at the airport Adelaide.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start even at a second landing approach and finally placed at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For adelaide a maximum temperature of 16 ° C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday, after spending summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and mortar bombardment on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas lowered and theSchools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought the communities drawn by rocket shot holes in the south of Israel a sense of joy and expectation, but the signs of battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" Kindergarten, who was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students granate clippers from the walls and sliding walls.
"We are a bit scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, Residee in the Kibbutz Saad and the English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it's "a little bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we did not go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire The war broke out last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, feel free to return.
The Ministry of Education shared with, such as a dozen families have not returned.
Her children were placed provisionally in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian shell.
He appealed to the children, to learn a lot and said "We will make sure that their knowledge is acquiring and offering you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a distanted ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end of the fighting;However, important problems remain unresolved, as the demand of Hamas after a suspension of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and seaports in Gaza.
Israel calls for a disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect calls is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of these civilians, and at least 494 children after estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the gazage area and about 250,000 people searched for more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protected rooms and continue the fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open soon, so we can continue to learn how the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza city.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data Corelogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, the RP data from Monday.
Through this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The Research Manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data demonstrate that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, on the other hand, by 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in state expenditure and where prices over the year only increased by 1.4 percent.
Mr Lawless continued to say that with the beginning of the spring, an increase in the real estate for sale would be observed, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If one considers the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in his arm.
Has never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry 19 was working in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry Probes for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and came from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, heard only his voice, "Listen to the crash.
Leave your sister in peace.
Move!
I want to look cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - which were already grown when I was a child - went with him into the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a crickepshill.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious type in the corner that reads the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a bit brighter now, but they are dark, smoky, deep stygic labyrinth with flaming racks and smoke and much soot.
My father just put himself in the tub earlier and then they could slowly hear him, as he started singing because he could wash the foundry of themselves.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had done the years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him was greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without loving owners of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we started, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Listen to hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should not we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friends with French he was married to 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should not we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabeteer.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You have to be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness thing and had to make a dramatic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is collected by the theater.
The comedy of the mistakes followed, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out its busy working life.
He started only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him on New Faces.
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies."I was the only black imitator / comedian on television for a rather long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to be big before the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could become an efficient joke narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people painted "black," Henry led his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I kindly wish that it had never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But these "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Due to the introduction of figures, the British black culture both mocked and celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy serie boss!known.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series Lennyhenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, because it feels like it's just the time you bring only the timeRum or kick a little on the spot. "
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode turned to Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned something about him in school and kept him predominantly for a domain of middle class, white in pantyhose and a cabbage in front.
So I was a big fear.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Do not do it bad if you do not know what you're talking about.
Take a pair of words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so.
Henry led 20 lines from Othello Last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I felt that I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put his head properly.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take you seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and just did not happen.
And soon he opened in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed." "
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me" You have to bridge 10 minutes now while repairing the computer. ""
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea continued to go as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God".
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theater
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
That too came up well, so it's like a big shield of the gods that tell me "this is your destiny." "
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks, while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a hall is afraid of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for that, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes joined the Apollo live in Apollo, if I feel like it, but overall, I do not have that much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a start, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not think I ever want to give up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I guess so.
I like an actor.
It is fun.
One always tells a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registered officials to curb "ghost employee"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to delete "ghost employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of persons still receive salary payments after their farewell to the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised in 2013 to combat corruption in the public service.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $ 1 million ($ 700,000) per month lost payments for "ghost employees" and other miscellaneous financial practices.
The government believes that salaries continue to be paid to accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear for identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is recorded on biometric registrations has been communicated in a government message.
All who would not do this without a credible apology would be painted by the salary list, was the message.
"This procedure is essential to rationalize the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and also adjusted the salary list on both levels of government - so the" ghost employees "are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Sekretiner in the Ministry of Decentralizationand planning.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", report local media agencies.
Police authorities did not give an immediate comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption studies against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen was arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and tapped telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the then Prime Minister) described their approach as part of the activities led by the Islamist spiritual Fethulla for him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and how thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Arsenij Jubenjuk his daughter to school.
There he shared waiting journalists that not all schools had repeatedly opened that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Popular Front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavjansk, visited Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that here will finally reign again and that the children receive education that will be useful in more life.
The first school date of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director you need.
It meets with a proud glory chain from the bank world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has its own frontal experience.
Their career began in the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back when the supreme post of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation was allegedly nearly 1 million pounds.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when this was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is an earlier Tory council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned goblet.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust works in two directions: inward on the first guard of own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outward as a voice of public concern and restlessness when things are wrong.
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly, which requires full comprehensive reform.
But which newly incoming chairman would risk it to succeed in sucking on everything and to take an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might bring himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtakes.
While the competition is approaching and new technologies threatening old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public buys into the world's largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she reaches 96 percent of all households and only costs each of them 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC rises up to the top of the popularity: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I today get newslash lines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that degrading tweet was not authorized
A Tweet of the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a reduction in the democratic district administrator, which focuses on a criminal indictment against him because of abuse of official authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which is the previous loss.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I do not cheaper the tweet and deleted him," said it in the later message.
Perry employees did not answer requests for comments.
Although the tweets from Perry's official user account went out, he was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable image of the district administrator of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was convicted in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry put a Veto against a financial promotion of their office when they refused to withdraw, which could be ahead of Perry - which could possibly be in 2016 presidential candidate - in front of a Grand Jury led this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets is: "I do not always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol levels ... but if I do it, I'll suit Governor Perry when he explains it."
I am the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the examination of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, which was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assets applied for in the case entrusted with the case, dismissing the charge and argued that the law, with which Texas's history against the State's Service Electoral Governor, is indispensable.
Perry stopped $ 7.5 million of state funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This Veto ensured a public complaint by a left-end watchdog group.
PERRYS Official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing the fifth in the field of election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he will stop by posting a tweet of a photo of jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of the most prominent contractors London pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England is back to normal level "returned".
Homes in the capital were hot desirable and the subject of enormous price increases, which the bank of England didward due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble to put higher limits for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transactional levels since the peak 2013" and added that this offered a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers urged the capital.
According to information from the Cadastral Office, prices in the urban area alone have risen 17.5 percent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices at Berkele's private, inexpensive and student offers increased by approximately one-fifth past year and were around € 423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate ownership in London for foreign buyers less attractive - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" in front of the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate agent FoxTons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper credit guarantees were presented, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year both in the second half of the year both in real estate sales as at the prices.
New Data from the Bank of England From Monday, a decline in mortgage license in July show what suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weakening house price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has meanwhile declined year after year by a quarter, according to the broker Wa Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for appointment sales are more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the appointment sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that there had been 3,742 new homes sold in the year by the end of April - almost a third more than the peak 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased annually by 40 percent to € 280 million, sales of 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.
In a communication on Monday before the annual assembly of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to comply with current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts consistently estimate the annual input tax result to £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at 23.96 pounds in the afternoon in London trade.
Nude photos published by Jennifer Lawrence by hackers on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearances at the 85th Oscar Rental.
Nude photos of the OscarPreighter Jennifer Lawrence were published online from a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of more 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence be real and complained to the hacker for "blatant injury of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will pursue all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing side 4Chan were allegedly procured by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple.The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winterstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported Buzzfeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, though Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"Those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have started in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodone series "Icarly" and "Victorious", however, stressed that the photos are pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of mine are faked, people.
Let's fight the beginning.* Pun intends *.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the pop star Ariana Grande the authenticity of the alleged photos of their abstrission.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly bought new novel about love and the letter "J".
She crashed, so it was best to describe it, she slowly triggered like a carton that you have been in the rain.
Occasionally he told him a woman, he was too seriously, exhausting, intense, distanced and maybe a bit scratch-bearing.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratching coat.
He was spiky, as in hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickliness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and maybe even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more secluded and rougher as a port.
She had come to the south with an older companion, the Kevern held for her aunt, and that had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leak, in the bathrooms were still spiders, nude snails had left their traces on all windows and believed, they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds looking like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening like tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat with ailinn holding on the broken sun loungers in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon.Both had attractive to the service console, which supplied the land with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, who had laughed at his father with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so banned - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesced, as the word obsolescence.
The general taste made what decreases and regulations never made, and how people in books choose the from-plate scrubber-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love romans, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Keverern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing great feet in a coarse-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn did not do that.
"That was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It had been a very funny game already then, and it was not very funny now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
The improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure of the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Keverern knew something about Jazz from the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group entertainment - grateful as the fate spaced.
People with Afro Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport by temperament and physique, so sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed as naturally with electronic talent and were supervised by the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left by the Polish community took care of the sewer;What was left of the Greeks, sluggish dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than what had happened when it had happened to be fear of being charged with fire pussy, for fear even that the flames would nine them next - hadLabneh- and shisha-whistling restaurants opened, considered considerable and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone after his skills.
Since she had only belonged to ballads, it fell hard to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just made their straightening.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Keverern.
Besides maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge carboat leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father should love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, hesitated, however, in her presence again two fingers to put his lips.
She already thought he was a bit strange.
"It seemed funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world as her unclouded raven black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see otherwise.
"If you say it," Mine you without conviction.
But that does not explain why you're doing it.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly not.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Do you hate you?
Of course, I do not hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It should be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often brought himself into trouble, because, like his father he did not have the soothing charm, which one needed to protect the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Keverern, that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console and spilled the wine she had drunk.
Elderberry wine, so drunk was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dick head is exactly why I feel perverted to you," she said ...
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words as well as the fear, which showed himself in her eyes, as she rebelled against him.
Did she think that he would beat her?
She had not told him about his life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more experiencing what had happened when their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled pub to pub, always ready to raise his hand against a woman who refused to give them or liable.
Dick head?
They would have shown their a big fist when they did not care!
She first smooched - smooch was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-motif to the unsound love ballads from the console - they first smooch and beat.
According to Kevern's view, this was unnecessary refinement, since the smooch itself already represented an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt bleating, but the force of his mourning surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew themselves.
She looked at him as he moved away - as well as from a room on the upper floor her companion to him - a man, complained by something he had to look up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight that she seemed to know, if she could not remember a single time she was in ithad already seen today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn was looking at Solomons on her feet.
Several years before the previous occurrences, ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf ofnow, worked on the non-legislative supervisory body for the public mood, in a short lecture on continued low and medium-sized violence in exactly the parts of the country,In which their reduction, if not abolition, are most likely to be expected, in view of the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There was a lot done, and a lot has to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who led a thousand wars and gained most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the countryWhich the sweet breath of human friendliness has historically seen historically despite the highest church towers between the hedges was rarely felt.
But some properties make up as an untraceable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion he wakes up.
The population cries in the listening of sentimental ballads, becomes more expert on stories about overcoming difficulties and claims to believe firmly to the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the previous rawness keeps the rural communities as well as our urban microstructures firmly in hand,But there are also evidence for the emergence of a new and sneaky queue at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
Esme walnut lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you atheist?
"I think I do not have to say that," Esme's walnut answered.
Are you lesbian?
Again, ESME relied on its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Release again.
"I do not ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I were against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a pre-judicial workplace.
We serve a preliminary company.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself can occasionally distort results as they have introduced them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things they call "underhang" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a naturally strength and vitality.
If you continue on the way around what happened when it happened, as if it had happened, if it had happened yesterday would happen yesterday, means its significant life force to the country.
Esme walnut looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that ofnow had granted the country in the last quarter century or more.
Smile your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, tell them, agree, agree, excuse them.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out," Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice as she was sure her supervisor had spoken to an end, "and I say nothing else, as we are not so effective, as we haveImagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find us again, as we repeat the mistakes that only happened to what has happened when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others we let our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angeled prey.
"They go too far," he said, "if they call acts as" mistakes ", which our grandparents may have or not committed.
They also go too far when they talk about that they had left their "anger" and their "mistrust" on "others".
It should not really be necessary to remember someone in their position that we do not speak of "us" and "others" when understanding the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of the, if we are honest with ourselves," dared to throw Esme, "no part of society can assert himself well.
I complain anyone.
Whether it was done bad or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing has to be said anymore - we agree.
And just like any guilt must be assigned, so no debt must be eradicated if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there is a way to pay it.
But what serves the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past serves that we forget you.
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz settled his pyramid.
"I will consider your report," he said, leaving her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist, who, as passers-by, was driven in a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup is planned;Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a coup to the fall of the government and said that they passed against policemen who accumulates the armament of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the countryside and informed that the land of the country surrounded his residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Premier brought his family into the adjacent South Africa after reporting on attendant threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it did not give a coup d'état that the military respond to the threat of "political fanatics", whose armament was facing by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports, that within the police acting some elements that actually wanted to armed some of the political, party-political young fanatics, which were about to be damaged, devastating damageTake up, "he said to Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a crash.
"Even if no one claimed to have torn the government through violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's Defense Forces so far show signs of a coup," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho shared on Sunday that the soldiers declined into their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governance during Thabanes absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he had become the target because of his experiment to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been big tensions since June after Thabane parliamentary sessions issued due to clashes in his unit government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, contrary to defenders.
Production in the Eurozone on a 13-month-deep
The increase in production in the Eurozone slowed in August at the lowest point of the last 13 months, such a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Producing Commercial (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced burglaries in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures meet before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expecting a clear plan for the handling of a hesitant recovery of the eurozone as well as for the impending deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
Factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worry child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion for stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer possible, are also not reassuring, "said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in the industry presumes the fire of analysts, which expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Administration at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchasing manager index of the producing industry in the Eurozone of August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are currently obviously very difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in terms of Russia and Ukraine - uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to some orders delayed or even canceled, especially major orders.
He said that it became "more likely" that the ECB finally has to initiate a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Year Year of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people of Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia were taken as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the ruling state in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrible siege of the School of Beslan, in which 334 people were moved, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night in front of a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, took and killed, seemed like the most evil of evil.
The tragedy combined West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims that had escaped death in the ruling state in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistors, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Your biggest hope?
That the war, who now Haunts Ukraine - and in the children like they die - now finding an end.
The girl who was photographed when trying to climb into the shaken school sports hall
It was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she tried only in her underwear to climb into the shattered school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Totally confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were kept dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me, I should race for my life, but I could not," said Aida at that time.
My legs were blood overflow.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to security.
After a series of operations she healed for completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid that I have to be operated again.
Some grenade plates are still in my knee.
Their goal is to become a dentist to help people how they were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not broke me," she says cheerfully.
"That happened to me, and you can not change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege becomes always a part of her, although the memory becomes a little more weak every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so thankful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I watch the photo of me online, as I climb into the school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help that something does not happen again.
The boy fled through the ball hail, in the opinion, his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old he said, "Mama told me I should lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear, they could be dead, he fled and looked on the way a crying toddler, grabbed it at his hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son outside in his arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I could not save her."
In fact, Tamara was stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that her son had been lost.
After her reunification she said, "I cried of joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-resolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror tracks you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it gets paler in my memory.
I still know that I got all my toy guns directly after that.
But now I can play computer games with firing scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the yard, and who did not take it outside.
We never say that they were killed or dead.
We say that they have stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well to my trip to London, especially at the toys shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a car open up.
But now he is afraid to place like Ukraine, where war causes the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror tracks you every day, but I wish I could stop reminiscent of it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the ruling," said Damir, who worked past week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I like to help.
One day I want to go to the police and hope you take me next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and these silence took many months.
She remembers lively to her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was a Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting to me and remember her and her husband in London, and she helped damir and helped me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat Borsch and called them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant.Damir shot with his water gun on her and she ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still killed.
These are exactly such children like ours.
I think that for many the war is part of the news you hear, if you are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not stop that feel.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive at all or angry.
He does not seek revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past ruling.
I know he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes laid on the sofa, the face facing away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys.Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came up with the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with everywhere body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell.
"I remember that I checked him," Damir, run, run away ", but I was so sure he had not heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life goes, unlike that of many other, for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible picture was after the siege to the symbol of the ruling of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood overflow was drawn from fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the shocking symbols for the Barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a female doctor, had settled him for his first day of school before they hurried to bring their older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she reminds himself.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day, where we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is long ago, I mean, it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are always pursuing me.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
Hauntlist: The picture of Georgij (left) was one of the shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day.He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
First of all, I knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there are even these statues of crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden from us at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It's important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever experience the truth.
People are always examining such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can not understand how that is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid of every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September is approaching.
I want my old childhood friends to go tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel victims, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not ponder me.
My life goes on.
I have completed the school this year and visit a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health was not allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, though he was trapped at feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it's nothing I've left behind me.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can not forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year afterwards - was the first and only times that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of hospital after siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the intelligence dabademie of the FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my documents, also the medical sent and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I have been behind me for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never report my children from my experiences.
Of course, children should not know and they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I'm going to commemorate the celebrations.
I know Georgij will not go.
It must be much more fierce for him because he was there and I do not.
I was waiting at home at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.All in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It's hard to accept that when something is so unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can not participate because of his knee.
He was operated several times, he can run, but do not drive sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always pursue us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that's the biggest gift that God could do me, but my heart is crying around the killed.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want that.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people for?
Why do you kill each other?
The war is very close to our country and I almost can not believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so movingly worn by a special use commands in security
Settled: Aljona Tskajewa is being safely brought by a Russian specialty commands (left).
It is ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world held his breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's siege.
The terrorists left them, but in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at that time three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married since then and with his new wife Swetlana has a little girl that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that raise with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam as the Gopro HERO3 + Silver Edition, both of which are for about $ 300.
I have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $ 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed.
Also, make your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenic and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the insulating underwater conditions.
And before they jump into, check them until their equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only admitted for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
In our shopping guide and the reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many are not flaps.
Point-and-shoot cameras feature an LCD that allows you to compose pictures, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So make you many recordings.
If your camera has a series mode with which a series of recordings are made with easily changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay near the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
If possible, keep close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos;The deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action-CAM: these devices often have a solid wide-angry lens, which means that they need to get poets to their objects if they are to fill in the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character is changing things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the patient both the agony of the disease as well as the torments of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to the diagnoses and diseases, while the treated are mostly busy with something very different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose passport began.
"I did not feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble to get up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient allegations.
"I'd rather be right now as later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and worried without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been to skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast fur, that is, the lungs overlapping skin.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While, for example, some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all pulmonary cancer were formerly smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once recognized as a "miracle" but has meanwhile recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore how easy.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, as the industry voluntarily committed to use it.
Also where he was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumber, construction worker, carpenters and shipyards, for example.
When an industrial hazardous substance from a different time he seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, today's highlight of a mesoltheliomic epidemic.
There are more deaths through mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year dies twice as many people in this disease than traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliomic deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we experience the deadly impact now, though asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all asbestos types were banned), is that a mesothelioma was developed after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still available in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and shops we shop.
And therefore, mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament buildings are asbestos abstract.
Also in the hospitals in which we should be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the initial herd of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
He did not find himself difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years, a lot of asbestos."he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital, and who suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us are still sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma dies within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading United Kingdom's leading expert, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestic epidemic in the UK is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them do not have any idea that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which those affected often turn to claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, to have exposed Janice to all the negligently asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the garment department at two locations - one of the flagshipstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her activity at M & S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I did not really know about asbestos yet.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not relate to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stirs from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roofing plates, floor plates, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but still viewed by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential death.
Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolite).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliom rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is by no means unusual.
He has submitted a study of those concerned, in which it is presented that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts is based on his statement after the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government, unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service schemes and pipelines were contaminated behind the parliament's committee rooms with asbestos whose deadly fibers could be reinforced by something so harmless such as "strong air movements".
Parliament members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like a true the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Westminster's Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ work has been applied for several years to renovate Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and asbestosTo remove, and that after the general elections in 2015, the deputies will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference center than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective regulations."
Nobody can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do is wait.
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits have been chosen positively," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places where you worked, and to the data.
What he is remembered exactly is the day in early December 2009, where he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and led a surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had a chills.
It came to suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I believed that the drive home can no longer create.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the breast fur, the skin around his lungs.
But as Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not work for a month.
Embroorded doctors made X-rays of his chest and set Pleurakathether to remove fluid from lungs and testing in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activities and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbotts came with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was older a few decades and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbotts worsened state and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribbed and the breast fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually keep doing on, "he says.
Honestly, I had not worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott appointed appointments with MacMillan nurses, one of whom recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestic acids in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from a building to the other in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate (as Graham Abbott often did), came with the utmost probability in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals for patients may be life-saving, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He is still removed today.
Students exhibited their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it does not only affect hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemicals, students have parked their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And meanwhile, so innocent objects in our homes such as floor plates or scrus roofs have included asbestos by default.
"It is an industrial lift that is included in large parts of our properties," Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case was the only contact that made an affected woman, the demolition of a garden shot in the 1970s.
So watch as you tear off your garden sheds.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immensely.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to go on, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice two weeks.
Then I knew that I had to go and to take care of myself.
Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a physician to that of a patient.
How countless patients in front of him reminds himself how it was overwhelmed by all the information he had to come up with.
"It was very hard to record all that," he says.
"I asked my doctor" How long do I have? "
And you gave me for about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I will not experience another Christmas.
That's it then. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly humid because it is our life-keeping mechanism - which is breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is whirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can set themselves in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast fur and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled acicular asbestos fibers," so professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson believes that it has exposed it to the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breafration to the edge where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hot controversial.
Some think that she was worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can not cut out the breast's fur," he says.
They do not come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy does not speak very well," the "effect shows", but not heals.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for sponsoring four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he introduced himself cheerfully to call.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would take four months and expect his life just one month to extend.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to make things appear in a somewhat more positive light. "
After consulting multiple physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Lang Lazdunski, Heart Thorax Specialist on Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I did not have to be further directed, I just shouted and got an appointment," gives Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma diseases to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many concerned are from a different financial concern - about the future of families they leave.
And so turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that one recognized that a very low load was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally put their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation", as Lawson could not prove to absolute security that his mesothelioma was due to a asbestos contact at Guy's.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma diseases that strive for compensation to assign a tremendous problem to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims, know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there was clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma affected to accuse compensation, even if their previous employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a funded by the insurance industry of £ 350 million for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, but can prove anyone, but can not sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process would have been able to have about £ 120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma affected that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers have had to pay if the time did not go over and find mesothelioma-sufferersAnd she could sue normally.
Also Mike Penning, then labor and pension minister, admitted that the law is "not perfect".
But both penning like Morgan said that in view of seven death pists a fast action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December of last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Lang Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course that's the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There is something that leaves you.
If you give up, you feel worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent in March 2012 of the operation.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftersorescent scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my chest.
I was just 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumors is more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"For parents, that's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not grow old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was restrained.
She did not say much.
Such talks are something that all cancer patients do.
But for mesotheliomeric patients, such conversations are not crossed by hope, not from a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as ultimately even for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government choice, demonstrators swear retribution
Despite the increased calls to democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 nomination, the Chinese Parliament decided by the Hong Kong Eldership.
This approach probably fires the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement in the way.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist guides in principle to dismiss all non-Beijing royal candidates.
"That does not come unexpected, but it makes us angry," Rechtsexperin Emily Lau said Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
One has lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei said, Vice-General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants to choose the government chairman from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct electoral right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly firmly retained by a close-up nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love for Hong Kong" should be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and crowd-effective protests in Hong Kong for several years took place.
Behind the Protordocratic Campaign in Hong Kong is the Movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to tailor the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general electoral right.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central trailers had gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement has achieved a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers suggested that the movement "occupied the central district only considered as the last resource, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days on the announcement of Beijing, and there were tightened security measures, including police forces and barricades on Sunday before the government building.
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that they slowly lose control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland strengthens the competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement, as they endanger the business - the lifeblood Hong Kong.
"The protests from which they speak could serve great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they persist," Rechtsexpert Regine IP, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fear fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported the democracy activist in Hong Kong than western powers controlled subversive agents.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the election rights, where 780,000 people participated - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the US will now be transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances are offered with the private plane.
We are pleased to react to this demand and offer the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have to work their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to seeing this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
A corporate spokesman said that there are no new bookings because the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also informed that despite the tuition of 9,000 £ per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students Today, their expectations and demands are very different from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as a lift.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of NUs for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the strongly rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can at all, thousandsFrom pounds for such a bit easy to spend the arrival in the dorm.
Feminists criticize race question and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands into the air and sang, "hands high, do not shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators use the gender in front of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequality.
However, while the tensions in the Midwest received and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's answers turned 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers black women shortly after the shots of the 9th of August came the personal essays with titles such as "thoughts about Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only revolving the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez that meant an important change.
"I do not think that you find many people in feminism who be about the white and speak privileges on so high-class style," she said.
People felt crowded to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that you have to express that.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell by the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to the light, which black Americans are exposed every day, which are not considered "women's topics" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored in your own land are under siege, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to publicly talk about a relationship, but not about security in public space?"she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For you black women did not have the luxury to clean the topics clean;They live every day in combined reality.
While white women now connect the topics of race and gender to feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research says at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were gently smelled and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the cleavage between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election law like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight for the suffrage only for each oneGroup could be successful: women or black.
"They met the decision to work for women's election, and the choice for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When remembers such things, it becomes aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists "catch" played with the problems with which black women have dealt apart since generations.
"Would not it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as serious as they do with the right to conception control?"asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who set up their career on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means now to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and released a punched article by Rebecca Carroll, Columnist of the Guardian, where she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the breed, which are significantly different in public surveys - the changes will lead," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which breeds - as well as gender topics are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are stunned.
Christina Sommers, Researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and Author of "Who Stole Feminism?"said to She the People, that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to their former criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the white house recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that urges the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has taken up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the theme of immigration reform also occurs back to the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reassessment of the theme as an essential woman issue they had to publish only the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
If the great majority of work visas goes to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position in which they are prone to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents than clear that it showed a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £ 120,000.
The details belonged to a picture of the living room of the house - which also belonged to a pig that his head had laid on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo was mistakenly released and was now removed," said a spokeswoman of the company.
In the exposé of the house Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique detached house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the picture from the website, it appears on promotional material.
The home sales made interest in the social media as some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.

Genetic disorder often diagnosed incorrectly
A British says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that they only have to live a few years after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of erentic disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem with people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure gear and curved toes.
Diseased suffer from numbness empires or pain.The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she was suffering from peaceful ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she dignity, and dying before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell all over and everything took longer.
I could never drive with the other children's roller skate or skateboard and was often going to go at school because of my way and run to run.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations for relieving their Achilles tendon and stretching their feet, they seamed their medical records when their doctor left the room and read that they suffered.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I did not tell anyone, but I went home, looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the Fa company," she said.
When I received answer, I was shocked and terribly panic.
I thought I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and dying with 25, and slowly lose all my skills.
I made everything alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not removed as much as she had imagined and responded to her doctor.
He just got up, and hugged me and said, "My love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you would be in wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, your CMT was found.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Tax loading of business people in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax assets for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area formed no exception.
Companies in the district of District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $ 27.6 billion to government and local bodies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue of € 26.6 billion.
State and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent to $ 671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent in the year before, and it was the third growth year in succession after several years of falling decisions 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more strongly than local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue of Marylands originate from companies.
With 28 percent, Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenues from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits from large states such as California, New York and Texas came, the process seems to be used for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia spread over $ 10 billion to government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $ 9.6 billion - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes amount to just about one fifth of the tax assessments of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C.Nears almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations, which do not pay any real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to offer the same services offering other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to recovery of the real estate market
Company revenue seem to recover, the data.
Company in the region reported on income taxes in state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rising evenly on all three places.
The ride rate in the District corresponded to the national average with 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes with 6 percent in all three parts areas (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The District was not studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to reach its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the company's corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3 percent.
In the meantime, the small businesses in the Washington area seems to be better to go, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, so the most recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure, according to which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $ 2.4 billion last year, a significant faster growth rate than theTotal corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably be stopped this year, with an increase in general multi-party tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared tosame period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the space Washington could be lagged behind if the expenditure collision of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region.
Family of Joan Rivers "expresses the thumbs up"

Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon confirmed just what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer and video production, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service twitch for $ 1.04 billion ($ 970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion-decided thing, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as JUSTIN.TV, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravory sites in games, a "YouTube for Live Games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "Let's Play", a video, in which a better-scientific playing (mostly older) play a painting of secret ladytheater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news was that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy something bored, a textbook example of an established technical company that bought a potential competitor bought up.
It is a mystery why the deal with Youtube did not come about, as the company was reportedly ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us fasterto get there."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, explaining that you prefer to do sports than watching, it's hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others while playing instead of taking the control console in the hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3am over the shoulder while sneaking through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner, as he turned into the head 20 times one after the other in Call of Duty.
All these games could just watch them.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without their own control over the view perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age are entertaining whole games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virtuososis is there, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly Will Amazon wants to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch just could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company likes to have: thousands of young men who are trained as advertisers.
Like the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a viewer sport.
Participant at the ICE bucket challenge is dislocated pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed as much as their ice-cold water was poured over his head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ICE bucket challenge went painfully.
A woman was hospitalized after she had screamed so much at the ICE bucket challenge that she dismissed the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when their ice-cold water was poured over his head, that they violated their facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did that, my pine was just stopping," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that did not went, the pine was hooked, and then I understood that something did not agree.
My mother and sister saw that too and made himself almost laugh in the pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the United Kingdom was hospitalized to revoke the jaw after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to Internet Sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students amount to more than $ 1,000 per year, the Fast-two-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving video.
He invented a lending system for books of higher semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the return sale.
"My mathematic book usually costs $ 180, but I got it for a $ 10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430, he said.
He made 120 $.
The collar management managed to issue the student on average more than $ 1,200 annually for textbooks and study materials, however, for the students there are various cost damping options.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeder's are increasingly solving the choice for the students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying.
Nebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, said that rents of textbooks have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college book stores was rented last spring semester, Nebo's Vice President Tevored Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores in Campus book stores.
Here is the clause for the best deals.
buy online
Some new books cost only one third of the price for which you are in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" Vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $ 290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99.
To buy second hand
If you do not mind the notes of other or normal signs of wear, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have $ 93.49 used for CHEGG.Com.
Matt Casaday, 25, final student at Brigham Young University, says he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of the Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $ 48.
Academicians such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask for their professors, whether earlier expenses are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs for the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if they treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and they do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $ 20.
Find out about the provisions of the business where you rent, also over the penal fees, which may apply to the writing of notes, underlines or signs of wear.
Tenant beware: If you do not return the book, the criminal fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
Even e-books instead of conventional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a specific period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for about 6 months for about $ 61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination for books, as it can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" no cash molding
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $ 30 million in its $ 90 million budgets in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill for" only played $ 12 million of its budget of $ 70 million.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored movie "Sex Tape" played at the opening weekend only 14.6 million dollars, while children's films such as "dragon tamen made easy 2" also disappointed in the revenue.
An article in Telegraph Film Critic Robbie Collin indicates that the child's films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described in 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "Dragonzamen easily made 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average cinemascore and metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and at least 2000 screens in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year's Film Hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book Film soon appearing, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I believe the times change."
We need to accept that and do not try to race the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash outcomes of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved sales with streaming content of $ 1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year in which sales were $ 837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for being too focused on films of comics and prophesied a "melting" Hollywoods.
Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could quite contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash molding in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash outcomes as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the moviover at all, and no one will worry about the businessdo."

Teenagers out of the Blue Mountains flown out
Two teenagers bushwanderers were safely brought with the winch after being caught the night over the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Worried relatives called the police at about 20 clock when they did not return home.
A search trunk from local police and rescue services broke up and the pair was found at about 11 pm near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt his knee and the man had fallen and opened his head.

Putin demands from Kiev the admission of "state talk talks" with the East Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government establishes the struggles against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately receives negotiations on the "statehood" of the renegade region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov clearly realized that Putin did not mean that the area of Ostukraine standing under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status of Ukraine must be redefined to the Russian-speaking region's powerTo give representation of his rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations at eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, suits the strategy seemed to be followed by him since the beginning of the riots five months ago: Help for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to theNewly proclaimed region Novorossija Factic independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West to enable.
In an interview with the state television channel canal one, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for reconquest of separatists held areas in the Eastern Regions Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula on March 18th.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately called the occupied area as "novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary splendor of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those involved in the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and during government groups to attack civilian communities in the fields held by separatists on early conversations "in their illusions", ITAR reported-Tass.
"We need to accept detailed discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the state status of the Southeast Ukraine, to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to Statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy that has been discussed by the Kiev's leadership for months to dispel fears of Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It's not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlinisher to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments underlined the leadership of Russia when dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast to the direct annexes of the Crimea, on which the majority of 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far more difficulties to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict showed a broad majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was addressed by Russian diplomats at international forums, would proactively give the regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control of an area that the Russian territory with the Crimeaconnects.
The five-month annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for most of the Russian Navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow area in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech on the inauguration on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation - according to new elections - should concern for the Constitution, with which the respective areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armament and mapping is accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist guides at eye level followed after another penetration of rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated over the previously peaceful region along the Asovian Sea into the Ostucraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the stroke, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officer, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Novoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have started to attach Mariupol to a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoasowsk and narrow access to the Criminal Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an earlier Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We'll be in front of a point where there is no back anymore," Warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine Crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian tankers and 1,000 soldiers penetrated into the Donean region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by Russian incidence in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko shared on Sunday.
