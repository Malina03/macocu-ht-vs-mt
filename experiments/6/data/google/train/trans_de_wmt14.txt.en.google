A black box in the car?
US street planner are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe the solution found in a small black box found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record each hazard kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Planning Offices of the States to revise the obsolete system for financing American streets.
The normally rather boring area of road planning suddenly has sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have been allied with environmental groups and expect the government to use small boxes for recording the kilometers traveled - and possibly where they were hazards and the information can then be used for the calculation of tax notes.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a series of privacy concerns.
But while you can not agree on a procedure in the congress, several states are no longer waiting.
You currently check how you can switch to a system over the next ten years to pay for the driver per dangerous mile.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the rides, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
That's really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we can only use," said Hasan Ikhraata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn.of governments plans to record the hazardous miles at all Californian motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is here.
The initiative comes at a time as the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes, is bankruptcy Americans paying on the dispenser.
But in America, it is not enough as much as it used to.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per liter) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not venture at high fuel prices, the tax only to raise a cent.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileably-based payment system.
"That's the most useful alternative in the long-term," he said.
Bürokrats denote it as a mileably user charge.
It does not surprise that the idea of urban liberals finds appeal, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the driving behavior so that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system in the development of strategies to which the ambitious, legally enhanced objectives of the state of climate change are to be achieved.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also explained that he see the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also done by the idea to let drivers pay after traveled route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Reason Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had asked the Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards miles-based billing.
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project last year, which has included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push and reacted with the concerns of Members of rural areas, which people represented, which often have many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless on their own in this direction.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which currently has 5,000 riders for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also consideres such a one.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Ministries of Transport of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers have been equipped with the appliances, motorists were skeptical at the thought, the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Benefits against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People did not want it.
When the test was started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on her website: "It would be relatively easy to transform the tachographs into full-grown surveillance devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look for an affordable technology with which the state can capture the hazardous kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
So, so Khan, the public would be calmed down.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states in the taxation of motorists.
Rather, it was her goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance companies where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles traveled.
But the devices you tested are also interesting for the road planner, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to get involved in when their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Large mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with drivers to give a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or you do not choose no device and pay instead a lump sum fee based on the average miles driven by all inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicion public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, with which parking fees are also paying to be paid for insurance only for a hazardous kilometers and rendering speed data from other vehicles in real time, dodging thanks to the motorists.
"Motorists would be motivated by the added value of the benefits that the system offers is to participate," says a planning document of the city.
However, some traffic planners are wondering if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay stated officials, the congress could solve the problem of bankrot highway trust fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could impose drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for surgery when an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of US intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum has received to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, who was presented on Friday of Ströbele the media in Berlin, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a criminal rulewhere no defense is possible. "
The truth to say is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes, he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to make the charges fall against him.
The charges charged by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state ownership.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said, "" If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we find ways to enable that. "
The relationships between the US and Germany are burdened by the allegations, the NSA has heard the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member, who manages the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that one should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if this is possible, "without jeopardizing him and to completely ruin relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Member of the Greens, published a picture of themselves and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden statement in Germany, then he requires assurance that he was "safe" there, according to the deputy.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and consecutive" persecution campaign that has expelled him from his homeland.
However, he is touched by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians - even in the United States - have called the revelations over an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring than a merit in the general public.
In his letter Snowden makes the German authorities offering cooperation, "if the difficulties were solved around the humanitarian situation".
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though to read in the announcement on Wednesday, that passengers are likely to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that one calculate $ 25, if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars at travelers who only paid on the plot.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of 100 US dollars goals to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began to demand fees for the first and second given piece of luggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to handle them therefore stuffed as much as possible in hand luggage, which has the result that the luggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to less on board.
O'Malley said, the new fee does not really go to earn money.
It deals with the most faithful customers of Frontier, which have been clearly expressed that it will be ever more difficult to find place in the subject above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the website of the airline do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the gate of Frontier may possibly take a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person has to pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they come to the plot.
The new hand luggage fee of Frontier occurs only in the summer, there is not yet an exact date.
Passengers often scold over baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to take back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wished.
Many of Wall Street consider the new luggage fees as a sign that the airlines occupy enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Three years ago, Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first fees for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost aircraft.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follow the additional fees.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand luggage fee Spirit annually feed 50 million US dollars.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown spirit and was curious what would expect to him on the plot when passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process belonged to the smoothest, which I experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth grazing and scare discussions on the plot.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding ran as lubricated."
Frontier follows spirit with the 2 dollars, which are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice were likely to keep the whole can and filled coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks for refreshment drinks, but made this back to seven months later, after passengers complained and had no other great society.
Frontiers Step to raise fees for hand luggage when passengers are not buying directly at the airline is the recent initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket.
This provides all societies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase instead of an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight journey with Frontier over 1000 miles booked at a third party providing customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively with direct purchase on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., published.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under the sale of the company.
NSA explains a "internal mistake" and not hackers should be blamed at the crash of the website
The Shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday, a mistake had charged its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as online was claimed.
"NSA.GOV was not available for a few hours tonight, as an internal error has occurred during a scheduled update," explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOs) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not reachable for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a speaker of the NSA had declared ABC News, the sensitive internal network of the authority is "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists took advantage of having paralyzed the NSA website with a DDOs attack.
For such attacks, the target websites are flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secular NSA, whose nickname was once no search Agency (no such authority), is now found in the bright light of the public and consists of the revelations known in recent months about their extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad sharp criticism- A result of secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy for the secret service-fired initial speculation about it, the incident today is the result of targeted cyper surgery.
Profit losses at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railroad manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported on Thursday a 15% decline in net profit after declining with decreasing orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract issues in the railway division under pressure.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not released flight test data for his brand new airplane of CSeries and did not give new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in the next September in the next September.
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft before one and a half months so far only three more starts followed, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a crash of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Derksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its evaluation of "Outperform" on Thursday on "Sector Perform" with a view that the stock has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery numbers were largely expected in aircraft, but from margin development in the transportation area we are clearly disappointed," said Derksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company in the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and see whether the allegations of the company are true in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The corporate governance also assured on Thursday to analysts and media, the program lying in the schedule.
"The test aircraft was no longer remained on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a conference call and added, while the service life of the aircraft had been scheduled for floor tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it was called by enterprise.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical if twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can take a plane of cseries into operation.
Bombardier explained it, it checks the planning for commissioning (ice cream) and will update these in the coming months.
"The slow advancing of the flight test - even if they obviously correspond to Bombardiers internal planning - strengthens our view that commissioning shifts to the first quarter of 2015," said Derksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardiers net profit fell $ 147 million or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share in the year earlier.
The adapted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Sales increased slightly and dropped from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion, then Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer gives you, he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged compared to 31st December.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were in the context of our specifications, but the low order intake and the market conditions total were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this division increased by almost eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport division was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased compared to December 31st.
The profit margin in the area of transport was impaired by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new specifications for the fourth quarter.
In the post-dating trading on Thursday, the Bombardier share gradually gave 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after being announced that the Google Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardiers closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, the drug boss warned against police determination, must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information about underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid, his secret drug dependence could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron before a large police identification because he was afraid of his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on its activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by its own coconguity.
The lawyer praised by criminalists as "first-class" with the nickname "bash" was arrested in his house in 2011, after the police had supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in an earlier drug process.
Steamed, like Scarborough (32) three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, delivered, while this was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer chamber.
The investigation brought that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards were found.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to procure information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a large preliminary investigation for heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police relied on a number of house searches Heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction can become public.
Today, Ditta, which works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and sentenced to the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two charges for obstructing the judiciary guilty.
He gave cocaine ownership at an earlier survey.
The lawyer was converted after the police found against Scarborough in their investigation that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the garbage bin of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough telephoned regularly with Ditta, who was at the dinner in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, drugged the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court became known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after being discovered at tests drugs of class A in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but struggled to take cocaine and said he talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed her discussion underlined the "law firm".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair test was taken.
In the police interrogation, he assumed companies both among his private address and the workplace an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he called important actors of drug trafficking, from whom he had previously represented after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law."
Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defense, as he has admitted to very specific clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer, which supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He looked forward to the police investigations as far as possible, so they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into trouble.
He was close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he admitted that his independence was compromised.
Ditta had any misconduct and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not wanted, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do that immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead was said of the police in Lancashire: "Mr. Ditta has done the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to acquire drugs of organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made it receptive to the motives of leading members of the organized crime, which commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the public for trust and confidence.
Ditta has left this trust and tries to sham him behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and organized Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice disguise, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be criminals a warning and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We find them and bring them to court.
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after explaining the conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trading.
Thirty-five other things involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years due to drug labels.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about him, in which he said his dream job is to represent as a lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner is Mohammed Ali and opportunities clearance is the motivation for hisWork.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a scary location and you may ask yourself: What does Parliament stop relying on the judicial independence tomorrow?" It was in the newspaper to read the bill for non-constitutional law.
"The law is draconically and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which is also part of Capitalfm, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites of Kenya.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send back to Parliament," he said.
According to the Zeitung The Star, the government with the new law "the media effectively in a stranglehold".By contrast, the standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a heavy blow", and titled the design as "Drakonon".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the posting to the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they released recordings of security cameras on which they were to see how the units sent to the crime scene supposedly the luxurious shopping mall took over.
Policeike David Kimaiyo responded to the incorporation of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the precharge was withdrawn after a cry of the media.
According to the new law, media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillingen can be occupied and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or to be excluded from an official press sensation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "already a single punishment can urge most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description according to "lively blogosphere" Kenya.
If you lose the media to silence, politicians could do unpunished, whatever you want.
"Nobody will ever experience," Mutuma Mathiu, Journalist wrote in the nation called the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If one leaves politician himself, lead the land into bankruptcy and us back to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators lasted the public annoys in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts arranged by the National Remuneration Commission and put their hearty salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month - they are among the world's highest.
Un announces new targets in poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years for poverty reduction.
In the run-up to the UN summit for sustainable development, who began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals", which will replace the millennium targets leaving the 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon declared in the evening at the summit, the time had come to "think out about national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to tackle a process to agree with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will spare no efforts to implement this mandate to me by Member States to realize our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium destinations. "
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos among the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president Mozambik to tune in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the country's future, she has exchanged its business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and connected on Thursday of the crowd on the Independence Court of the capital.
For two weeks, there have been nearly daily reports on collisions between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once again a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by White Rhodesia and later the South Africa apartians government in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
According to the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country returns to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy is a lot on the game, because the discovery of huge gas deposits in front of the coast and carbon warehouse in the northwest could in the next few years investments of more than $ 50 billion of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy andBring Anadarko from the US into the country.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant power, and Renamo give each other blame for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the youngest clashes by attacking their members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos on October 17.
The attacks on the earlier rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speakers opposite the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo blame for the clashes and accused the organization to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play concerns about instability.
Opposite AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama consider himself as a "loser" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions to the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives birth to the 1992 Peace Agreement.
He explained to the FT, so he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to recover again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions that were fired through a number of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) that collide the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, Lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is well in negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which urges electoral reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence than the attempt of a criminal movement, to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electionals shrink since 1992, while a newer party, which, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - his resignation is due when his second term ends next year - destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multiparts democracy, he does not want any transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the president office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear about which capacities Renamo has, but she has undertaken unrest-ending attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connections.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, which is located but Beira, the harbor, the mountainous companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "The International Community warn that things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of MediaCoop, an independent media company, because many people already made themselves because of corruption, sluggish progress in the development and a recent kidnapping shaft.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions for the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"None interest Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life" means an author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force no chance has against clever tricks", and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it was to have a dream.
Many of myths, however, are "by far too wild, offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught to schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have suggested that as a plan for twenty years.
He added, in authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic", children would "switch off completely", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "subliminal" mediated.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Boowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and British Folk Valley, explained: "You can follow specific intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children lies in need to give hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be showing subliminal, disclosed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of show instead of telling.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the Variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Confércier in the Palace Theater on Broadway, started, the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversationto tell.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as well as on the New York Comedy Festival.
Laid up and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and great theaters this year.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more successful until they were familiar at some point to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so we can continue working with you.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as from "Stand Up For Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for Armeeveteranes in Madison Square Garden, where among others Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby occur.
The festival also grown the world of comedy.
A series of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known more unconventional ways, such as shipments on smaller television channels such as comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a Sitcom in cable television (the Ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the "Saturday Night Live" as well as "Parks and Recreation" part of the cast, although it is best known for its viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the Surreal Pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the Ironian, concentrated W. War nuclear Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the largest visitor's magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up Comedian, but has become a prestigious television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television program titled "Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me if he is here, then he sometimes go through the alley between two buildings and thinking: Hey, if I lose my whole money, then maybe I live here.
Oil price continues to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price also fell on Friday after taking over a high offer a report, after which the energy hunger production sector is growing China.
The reference raw pots for deliveries in December fell in the late morning in Europe in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange at 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a pricing of 5.8 percent in October.
The large crude oil offered the prices in recent weeks.
The US Energy Ministry declared on Wednesday, the US offer increased last week by 4.1 million barrels.
Over five weeks, the offer has risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were evidence of greater demand through two reports on an activity growth in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, the growth of which had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after being at the lowest level for two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Sort Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London at 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the Stop-and-Frisk Directive of the NYPD
A Federal Convention Court in the US blocked on Thursday the arrangement of a judge who required changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Program ("Stop and Browse") of the New York Police Department, and the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Court of Appeal declared the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be exposed until a vocation of the city was decided.
The judge had judged in August, the city violates the constitution with the way the program is implemented for the stopping and consultation of persons.
The city appealed against her assessment and the remedies of remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring center, which the police should assist in the change of their directive and the corresponding training program.
The appellate court heard the arguments for the required suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report declared that the judge must be released from the case because she has violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partism;This was partly due to a number of media interviews and public statements, in which they had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged police officers injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they are inappropriately sampling black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service planning, and ordered a pilot program with the body-born cameras in which most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after a control by the police.
An oral proceedings to appeal to the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics was criticized by a series of civil rights.
These species have been in different forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of office of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg on an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged all minorities filed a lawsuit developed into a class of class.
Proponents of changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program of the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices and create a trustworthy and more effective police and affect the way other police presidents use the scheme.
Opponents believe that changes would dampen the moral of the police, but not the crime;Also, money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police did not resolve, which is under pressure after the elimination of thousands of places in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they do not finish the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutionally, but only the nature of the implementation of the controls through the NYPD reformer.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a tips
The former news of the word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly put "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" when trying to confirm a wrong tip on an affair of the former Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew EDIS QC declared the court at the Old Bailey, News of the World had a false rumor in May 2005, that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to chop Pawlby's voicemails, and watched them, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court experienced.
"According to the public prosecutor's office, Coulson, which is now publisher of the NOTW, is nobody who stands in front of the apartment of Leuten and hopes to stab them on fresh act, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction"Edis explained.
He said NOTW use three procedures to investigate stories in investigative: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can not be different.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He argues that, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the Feature editorial staff of NOTW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby: "Do not waste their time, she is with Charles."
A band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was ensured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on the Pavely and their sister were stored as "projects".
In the time when the research ran, the grandparents received by Pavely Anonyme calls, in which they were asked for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, the former boss reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to spend tomorrow, over which I would like to talk to Charles."
EDIS declared Coulson's activities at this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson has confronted Blunkett because of an affair with a married woman when he himself was with the co-defendants Rebekah Brooks, which had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brook's argue to persuade with others to chop between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added phone hacking.
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia for state surveillance
On a mild day end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep through the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the statement of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Control (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word change between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US-American Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted that the US has no opportunities for foreign espionage, "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to expand their international competitiveness or profitcould. "
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become the Whistleblower former employee, with the publication of his cornucopia on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director in the word.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and procured data American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, the company paranoia has brought to a new high due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone may have been liable for ten years.
If the most powerful person can target in Europe, certainly business lines are certainly potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence and company transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Green, President of Bitmi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now presented an almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the Advisory Center Ey.
However, in the documents leaved by Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked particular IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag has been proposed, we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German Software Manufacturer SAP.
If you would have wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have been out of the age of 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from the coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of the US espionage authorities revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies, which had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
The cloud computing takes place a great change, because European businesses are now more conscious that data stored in the United States are subject to local case law and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, under the revelations about the US data mining activities with PRISM about ten percent of non-US-based members plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question of customers who did not exist a year ago - it is: Where are my data stored and you can guarantee that these are physically in this legal area?"
Many German enterprises represented the view that the recent reports simply confirm just what they knew anyway, namely that mighty states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage takes place is no surprise.
It has always been like this.
"It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemistry Company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do that, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The corporate governance usually does not boast about the countermeasures that it has taken, because that gives an attacking advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been towing for a long time that taking away a free USB stick on a trade fair or the unguarded lying of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member of automaker Audi, says that it has been among the standard practice for years to collect the cell phones in front of a board meeting so that they can not be used as a listing equipment.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid cell phones when they go to foreign travel because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid cell phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are worldwide market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warn their own companies from economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia and Israel behind China were ranked in two of the countries that served for the procurement of hacking economic data.
A member of the Executive Board of a German Blue Chip Company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy their allies."
Parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believe in murder
The parents of teenager whose corpse was found in a collapsed ring mat in the gym of his high school are convinced that their son was murdered, the lawyer of the family explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat that stood behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
The examination officials of the sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but what the 17-year-old family doubles.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, opposite Foxnews.com.
They never thought he had died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that there are any logic, violating the laws of physics as well as against healthy sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be refurbished to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Her son went to learn to school and came back in the corpse bag," he comments.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be a formal determination to the death of Johnson, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient foundation for a formal determination," he said.
Moore explained to reporters, the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson had died in the consequences of a "position-related suffocation".
However, a second autopsy had a different cause of death, so Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation to death Johnson's death, he will hire the FBI with the implementation of the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities must release all monitoring videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The parents of teenagers said they hoped that the video recordings contained instructions on how he died.
CDC publish allergic guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines, which the US government has issued, as the number of school-age children increases with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the faculty and the staff and how to deal with children show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the auto-injection of the brand EPIPEN is most commonly used - to be able to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that Schools Epinephrin can be easily in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair lies on it" or "my tongue tongue". "
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with non-unique genitals.
Newborn is no longer rigid male or female.
According to the new law, parents do not have to explain gender for such children, but can "indefinite" or "not determined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they no longer have to make a hazardous decisions regarding operations for a gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersexes.
An intersexual person said loud BBC years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I stay the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is no one of the world or girls every year.
They belong to the intersexes, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise you to use the best information available for gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the childbefore you decide - if at all - for an operation.
The New York Psychiatrist Dr.Jack's thresher specializing in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "blade after a good cause".
Intersexexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical procedure, but for most children does not apply," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data about how a child ever develops his sexual identity are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011, it is said to distinguish intersexual people from transsexuals or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor feminine, but typicallyboth simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics showed into subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in professional life as well as the extent of harassment, violence and pre-judicial crime.
Not with the gender image matching boys now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal for adults, it is possible to specify on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person, after a court had granted the lifelong retention of a "unimaginated" sex status.
German IDs in addition to M and W in the future have a third allocation, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender topics are still controversial, such a news message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the Strict Catholic Land signed a petition that the "gender theory" from textbooks should be removed.
The US website Catholic Online has also pronounced against the German law, with the reasoning: "If the world is dragged into a new state, where the gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, but we do not twist two more pillars of theCivilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone, she found it better when babies are assigned a gender at birth.
"The parental, even without further restrictions is already stressful enough, especially if you do not know the gender of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and safety.
Historically, children who were born both male and female sexes were referred to as Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine looked at the gender as something that can be extinguished and then rebuild.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted after now known how complex is the sexual identity, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, one called one, psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals goes to Dr. med.John Money back from John's Hopkins University, who represented the view, the gender is formable.
He shaped the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental impulses - as parents educate a child - interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John / Joan" from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a botched circumcision to completely castrate the child and remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," says there.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
But with 38 he committed suicide.
According to Therzer, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the collection of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, which are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with Xy-male chromosomes, but ambitious genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was tied as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I'm not a girl," he explained to abcnews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something did not agreed, he demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized with my birth - and nobody ever said that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitalia.
After experiencing the truth, he moved back to male identity, received testosterone injections and let his breasts removed.
Through the operation he has become infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, cares that the German law "can encourage stamp and stigmatize".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign the child, not determined '," she explained.
We are afraid that favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization support the Australian law, because "It allows adults recognition as a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legally gender," she explained.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to whom you should force small children at this time.
If you are adult, you can decide on your body yourself.
ButArlene Barratz, a breast alcohol from Pittsburg, which has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorized" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD name complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today is Katie 29 and married;She works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, hopes, however, to get a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents room, making them do not have to make decisions," Baratz said.
It gives you the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives you time before you write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine - you pull the child big and loves it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you do not have to surprise an operation that can not be undone.
"That concludes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents drift because they think they would not do the right one," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that fits better to him - and that's wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Report: Obama campaign considered to replace biders through Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have considered secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2010 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the election campaign 2012, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the Buchs in the near future and they reported on Thursday evening that the top adviser of the President "carried out extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if it looks better for Obama's dwindling hope for re-election if he falls bidLeave.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Policy Correspondent of Times, the book thoroughly distinguishes the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, especially the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the survey values that have the survey valuesFormer Foreign Minister Clinton to trade against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly heeled secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen the narrowest adviser of the President - including Daley, the former campaign conductor Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former senior consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the discussed change.
In "Double Down" is claimed that Daley had stood at the top of the efforts to exchange biders despite their "tight, personal relationship" before they finally decided against such a chess train after the data showed that the candidacy Clintons "the chancesObamas would not significantly improve ".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually considered to replace bidets by Clinton.
"I expressed a whole bunch of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained the magazine.
You have to recall that the president then had terrible survey values, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigations as "offered care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN, that there was a significant effort during the re-election campaign to find out if such a train to clear in terms of ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money will be issued for surveys and focus groups, if you do not seriously think about something," Martin explained to AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then BOSS had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was "aware of", the former head of staff was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" no definitive answer to the question proved whether the political probes Obama's desk had reached.
Cooper asked Martin, whether he is seriously thinking, Obama did not know any of the investigations whether to drop biders in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
Fancy ice cream, which lights up in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice-luminous ice - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research work on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, which raises the pH in the protein and trigger the lights.
Chris explains, the ice cream react to the warmth in the mouth and light - the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm delicious", says, "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH is increasing and the ice lights up.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful illuminant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors facing beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible and for itself impossible due to the refraction that is caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists;But I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I was allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I was more likely to become Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I did not agree to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep, as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be accurate - celebrate this year Halloween and give a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then are the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of 6.9 billion issued US dollars, so the NRF.
In this year, placing inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women do not have to cover themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft-punk space men will create it this year into the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect it's nothing wrong in tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans give 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, the Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate, lollipops, sweets and gummy bears.
So good news for the according to the Ministry of Commerce 41 million people who take the quarters with the saying "Sweet or Soures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and - we do not do anything.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn;Nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it will be sold around Halloween, so the national association of confectionery manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn kernels.
It's a mystery I could not solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween as houses in which it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized hospitals in the United States, which achieves $ 500 million, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are peeing yourself in the pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where to put on FacebookYou do not get rid of it, and then the guy on which you are standing, leaves a comment like "Nice facial expression".
But we finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the big pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we made from small.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us are raised to grab the pumpkin and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about $ 106 million for pumpkins, so the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rotted in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where this year, 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score properly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve a bit pretty from her 921 kilos of heavy pumpkin.

In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Calling fire brigade to rescue a puppy dog, the 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky projection in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had ran away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered from a stroller in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters ruled on rock wall and rescued the dog before safe death
The fire department succeeded in collaborating a puppy dog, which set on a 15-meter high projection in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before she was saved from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, which the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reception Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published help courses in social networks when they run after the small traffic accident in the quarry.
About 14:15 on Wednesday saw a stroller who performed his dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter high heel in the quarry.
The Technical Rescue Team of the Cleckheeaton Fire Station hurried to the point and ranked to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said, "She was in a dangerous situation.
She was in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from above and the ground removed.
She did not muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff frozen.
But now she is fine.
She then eaten a few dog boxes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge luck."
There was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to examine, but nothing stated otherwise exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To look at the rescue was scary."
I could not believe that she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in his arms.
The veterinarian explained if the exhaustion has become too big and had collapsed, she would probably crashed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that they would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he had never turned on Katy Perry as she was 18.
With an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer to Jaggers Song "Old Habits Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinnered with the Altrocker, and that "he has staggered me when I was 18".
She added, "That's a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever undertaken approach attempts at Katy Perry."
The representative supplemented: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.

George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new terror history for independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This delivers the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the HadrianSwall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template was pointed to the potential economic benefits that would bring more travel freedom in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter - as expected - in the headlines.
Nobody also mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland is currently not a Schengen area, the continued non-observance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has already come in the years that they already like a fossil: the first time I have heard the "independence means passport controls" party at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in constant repeating these ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland that it dances to the European pipe?
Why replace the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to the union for the union of Europe is faltering.
With the euro crisis, the project is officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties win to ground, which are the EU hostile or would like to throw the euro as a community currency overboard.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeeping Party alternative to Germany - was founded only this year - just under five million votes in the federal election in September grasp and thus effectively distribute the free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There was always domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out as a turning point.
Because of the stringent austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is forced by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do so that national governments cause excessive budget deficits - that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates, which are advantageous for German exporters - and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe can be found again with a built-in productivity disadvantage towards Germany.
The only possibility is to cut wages and public spending - inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency issues is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels-prescribed "green" energy directive lines - a code for the subsidization of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry compares to the United States twice for electricity and fourfold for gas.
This is a paralyzing cost discharge, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage tests in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry to be pushed into the corner from cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt pulls up, especially in France, the former cheer leader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with whom Germany could hold in chess and lift Paris at eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a goal on political legitimacy and has pushed Europe his own economic policy, which has to fight for the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens right-directed, EU enemy front National has just won a crucial slot and thus refer to the ruling socialists in third place.
The front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labor Party that it can not assume, a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What makes Le Pen with your new popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class?
It would like to use EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then such a block could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point I want to go out: In a non-far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come to the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it becomes more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Great Britain from this project dissociates hopes to enlarge with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Great Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which also belongs to Berlin and Brussels to say what they can sit where.
I suspect Scotland could drive quite well in a looser European network, as long as we keep our own currency.
The cooperation with other, similar to thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider it equal to Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against the austerity policy in Europe and won in 2011 a spectacular majority due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labor Minister of Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-LibHad to answer for the coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now, only to get a saving policy forced from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: grow faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty as their white peers, as investigations show.
Physical changes do not directly mean the puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Pediatrics Association This week in Orlando, Florida, explained the Pediatric Endocrinologist Dr.Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time to calm parents - usually this is not an indication that the puberty is now fast," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair and body odor, show themselves in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first control bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, a little less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the development of the breasts begins, it takes for at least two to three years to the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "early onward" if the breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates - something that a pediatrician can monitor exactly.
With fast advancing, tests may be indicated by an endocrinologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another episode: premature aging of the bones that can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained, which is concerned with medicines, but he admits: "The suppressing puberty can soften behavioral problems and the feelings of girls mitigate, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"You worry about pregnancy risk or how you handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter has got their days with ten.
Even though there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came into a frightened and excited from the school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there are no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causative.
Boys come like girls earlier in puberty.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls at the age of six to nine years, which establishes a connection between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country African American and Hispanic girls tend to be more likely to puberty than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all sorts of things to be influenced, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: although boys grows the facial and pubic treatment before, the trend towards a fully former puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors on the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is distributed even in babies and toddlers.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true start of puberty," Dr.Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to advise themselves from their pediatrician, as they should talk to their child.
"That can mean that you have to lead a conversation earlier than expected," Riet Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls blossoming early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he used to happen as intended.
Jumbo manufacturer quarrels in the face of large orders via seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class with long-haul flights, indicating the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offering passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those to endeavor the airlines most, but this designated room represents the key for efficiency attempts with the latest aircraft of Airbus Sas and BoeingCo. is.
Airbus demanded a industry standard this week, which requires a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archrival Boeing says, the airlines decide.
The dispute occurs at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete for victims of even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flyers, and recording orders expect at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed - especially whether it gives ranks with nine or ten sit - is crucial for the specified economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to supply.
Boeing claims his modernized "777x" faith 406 people while sitting in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 carried 350 people in 18 inches wide sit in the tourist class, where there is nine per row.
Airplane giants often share bats over technical details by advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus appeals in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777x is expected to make the race with more than 100 orders, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertisement war and brokers showed a picture in which three persons squeezed together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing suggests long-haul flights in sitting, which are tighter than regional turbo props," says Airbus sales leader John Leahy.
In view of changed dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance tour, and the end of the century, the weight of the male Average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to American health statistics.
Airbus says his rival adhere to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the freshly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
One has done so Airbus, examinations that occupied that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the numbers of Airbus to the seat dimensions and says it does not matter at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between airtages and facilities.
The company also explains, according to investigations, the experience depends on the plane of more than the seat width.
"It really goes out to give airlines flexibility so that you can do what you look like to succeed," explains the aircraft cartridge Kent Craver from Boeing.
You do not want us to dictate what you make profitably.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it's about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could be sustainably affecting the US or Europe's export balance sheet.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the confrontation around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300s.
The statements Boeings to the results depend partly that the 777x is compared with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than with currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, head for passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers chose the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: From an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin facility, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet seller even bear tape measure in order to resume the facility in the competition.
Even if you try the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly damaged design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has no sold according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized how important more adaptability of the cabins was and offered for some jets wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably burf, but could distract from the wave of 777x sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the gardue
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice a life for nicotine addiction.
Before testing in humans, more attempts are needed, which can take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help once of millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to contain genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, whereby a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice, which were administered nicotine, kept their normal activity level.
By contrast, mice without vaccination have taken a "time out", explained the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had achieved their brain.
The experiments are described in the SCIENCE Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could be administered to children for people, before they were tempted, to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
"You know then: If you start smoking again, you do not feel pleasure because of the nicotin vaccine, and that helps you to take the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned, there is still further research necessary.
Tripodi denies, influenced by beepid
Against the former minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a determination is initiated by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW-Minister denies that the regulations on maritime despair on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obid have changed, which had hidden investments in three land on state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC independent Commission against corruption) has extended its investigations to the question on Friday, whether veid has influenced various Ministers of State, lease agreements at the Circular Quay, where the OBEIDS operated two restaurants and a café, without tender after their expiration in theTo extend august 2005.
Now it is now determined because of the allegation, Tripodi had known by Obid's concealed interest in the land after Tripodis had proposed former Deputy Staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In many years of talks started in 2005, the government was pushing for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the companies at the Circular Quay, which had a € 2.5 million dollars per year, were extended without a public invitation to tender.
Tripodi, which was Hafenkister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally pronounced public tenders.
But he struggled to have made the changes at the request of beepid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a transformation of government's leaning regulations.
One of the ICAC submitted telephone shortages showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had changed into the Port Ministry after he had worked under beepid in the fisheries authority.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial leasing regulations?" The Deputy Commissioner asked Anthony Whaly Tripodi.
"No," TRIPODI replied.
I can not remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a senior government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explained what the goal was, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was to russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice Israel has already carried out air bonds on missile supplies in Syria this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visa could be subjected to "authenticity test"
The Government decides on extended measures through a "certificate test" for foreign workers with 457 visa.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used by a criterion, which should prevent that 457 be used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government's discussion proposal has been published after the former Member of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, which had sentenced the government's comments to foreign workers, because they could be understood as an insult by the neighbors of Australia.
"Lovely explanations such as, foreigners are supposed to start at the back 'and, to set Australian first' are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions demanded a protected labor market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically considered that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region had a echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures, which were once considered by the former immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was talking about human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is assumed, someone who applies for a visa to be reviewed whether "the application in cases is genuine in which the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company or personally"
Companies could also be obliged to make account of accounting for the number of 457 visa owners after entering companies in the past, which initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, eventually hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri-Lanki asylum probably died of a heart attack after he had arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday, which was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England with the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Great Britain closer together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government at this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England of € 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in conversations with transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less of Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network, the Great Britain and its cities merge closer."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it we stand in front of a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on to use "unmistakably" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed railway connection carries the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail links in the UK."
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which provides advantages for all and complement Glasgow-Edinburgh's connection, which already plans the Scottish government.
I am pleased to examine the examination report with the British ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain inert for the time being in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing, despite the US efforts to loosen the regulations for such devices.
US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their specifications, so passengers on their devices during critical flight phases of e-books can read or play videos if they are in "flight mode".
During the majority of the flight, passengers is already allowed, but there are many people annoying that they can not read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian societies observe the decision to implement the US airlines of the US airlines do not pursue any immediate plans to change their rules.
The air navigation authority Casa also explained that you will see the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"Casa currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft", was announced.
The topic is subject to provisions to which airlines maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by the cabin personnel.
Virgin has already led and explained with the CASA talks on a usage expansion of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, one is open to change, but these would have to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the Casa, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said a spokesman.
Qantas explained, one will remain with the current rules until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices can not be used at startup and landing, and we do not have any plans to change," said the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations, of which passengers can benefit, and will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different from US societies depending on the age of the fleet.
You must prove that your aircraft can tolerate the radio interference with mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After a flight company has confirmed the tolerance of her fleet, it can allow passengers using portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones in each height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in case of poor view, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended harder devices at startup and landing safely under the seat or in the compartments to stow over the seats.
Pawn houses boom in Singapore, as the crisis arrived in the middle class
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden bangle, a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there is my whole money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollar (about 1,730 euros) every month as administrative staff and their husband also work, the monthly family income does not emphasize them.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where the debt of households increases - so great that Valuemax, where they made their exchange, was the third pawn house listed at the Singaporean Stock Exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as low as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäuser in Singapore requires an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent, which requires United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawn houses offer that there are no review of creditworthiness or proof of income here, which is why loans are possible faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhäuser, after families feel the pressure through rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic spaces, families with lower and medium-sized income are looking for pawn houses in order to balance the difference in stuttering the economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budgetary debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, referred to as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia stands with 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent nor in 2008.
National economists are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data also showed a continuing export efficiency and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in the face of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to complement their income, wherever that is possible," says Song Seng Wun, Economist at Cimb, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices In the last two years, the trend towards pledging personal items have strengthened, as people use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 Pfandhäusern of the City State Gold.

Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government consists of the hard conditions associated with the rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian healthcare system to ensure that the government of the state can not waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis, which was caused by an aging population of the island State, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided by government consulting with the independent Tasmanian deputy Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has laced an emergency rescue package, which in our opinion concerns the unique challenges that the state sees itself," explained Plibersek today.
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for voting services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments because of gray star, residues should be eliminated.
In addition, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, the specialist training, psychic health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas of which I have said affected clinic staff, they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister was at a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state has to maintain the current level of financing to obtain money from Commonwealth, and report it monthly where the additional funds were issued.
A three-member commission is set up and should ensure that the state of health services proves as effective and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $ 325 million would take little if "they are not accompanied by real reforms, which bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for reacting to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aids will make a major contribution to taking the state's public healthcare system from the worries," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely make up for the recent incisions.
But the health policy speaker of opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is just a "paving solution".
"We are therefore in today's situation because the Labor State Government has deducted $ 430 million from the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
It can not be that a state government almost breaks down half a billion dollars from the system and the Commonwealth is 300 million in and then do the good news.
Dutton requested Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package is spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and Gitft gas ammunition, explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country came to severe clashes near one of the sites, which are stored by suspected poisonous substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Civil War before three years ago.
The announcement of the organization for the ban chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the appointment
November 1, which had set Damascus-based organization Damascus to destroy all institutions for the production of chemical weapons or "inoperably", including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, must begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including sensory gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday, saying of the experts saying that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits, as communicated in the United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group pursued by a network of activists in Syria the number of dead, explained on Thursday, 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government belonged to 29,954 of them of the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also under the dead are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of which have compounds to Al Qaeda groups.
The observation center said it was given losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not call any details.
The struggles underline the risk of chemical monkey inspectors, because their mission to liberation Syria from his toxic weapon arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "Now convinced that it has seen all important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "are currently no further inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 of 23 the sites given by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two facilities had not been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC, the two locations were abandoned according to Syrian statement "have been abandoned ... and the existing objects of the chemical monkey program were relocated to other mentioned facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear if the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, the next month must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC.
"I prefer the hat from the bravery and the courage you show all when fulfilling the most challenging mission that has been carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a commentary published by OPCW.
Since now three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim Regebels in this Civil War fight against Assad's government and their security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a cleavage of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group said Rami Abdurrahman, there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air-defender in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger about judgment for bombing Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had been living in Bali in 2002 in 2002 responded annoyed to the judgment for the last of the instigator who was put to justice, as Umar Patek should be shot aside.
Patek, who was almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons of Southeast Asia on the run, was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bomb attack to a prison sentence of 20 years.
He could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was guilty of the mass murder for guilty because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A guilt was also a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor had a lifelong prison sentence, even if she for the man who is also called "demolition man" because of his reputation as a mastered bombing builder, could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who has lost her 39-year-old twin stalks Jane and Jenny in the devastation graced by Patek and his co-swaring almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting she said, Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put it in front of a shooting command," said Corteen towards AAP.
I have to live every day that I will not get any further grandson and I will never see my daughters anymore.
The Sari Club was equalized to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small staster shortly after 11pm, parked before the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds former a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosive.
He fell into coma and "died" three times after the attack for a month, while he hung on a life-keeping system.
Hughes said Patek has deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemahah Islamiah - Amrizo, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
Leaving him alive - no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber that stood in court.
He escaped almost a decade of the arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US armed forces Killed almost four months later the former Al Qaeda boss Osama Bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden with the aim of building the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He did not ask himself," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown a remorse for how much suffering he added to other people.
The verdict was given before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, committed by commemoration celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not lead cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now listen from departure to landing their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and use watching films, but do not make phone calls with the mobile phone, so the new guidelines on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)be published in the USA.
But the passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as it would be implemented, Hinge from the respective airline, FAA employees declared Michael Huerta on a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the passenger staff as well as the rules for the stowage of equipment according to the new regulations.
The FAA explained that she has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Under these airlines were also delta and jetblue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can only start again when the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers have to switch them off again and they must not restart before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft be secured against electronic disorders allow their passengers to use the equipment even at startup, landing and rolling field, explained the FAA.
Most new commercial aircraft and other pliers converted to the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should correspond to the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Berufsverband's professional flight attendant, welcomed the changes.
"If the new scheme is safely implemented - and we work closely with the airline - both side benefit," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel good about this topic.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading of data remained prohibited under three kilometers, explained the authority.
Passengers are prompted to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words with friends", the Scrabble resembled online game, which played the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a Jet of American Airlines, because he refused to turn off the device while thatAirplane parked on the plot.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed away as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not in the FAA.
FAA may pick up ban on certain electronic devices at startup and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the Traffic Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile phone are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause malfunctions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disturb transmitters," says Rosenker.
An advisory committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this topic, recommended last month that the government has a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
In some studies, there is a speech that forgets or ignores up to one-third of the passengers switching off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of navigation and communication devices have become known by passengers carried by FM radio, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems as previous generations of aircraft, but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference does not mind.
Airlines offer passengers for several years Wi-Fi, when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only make minimal radiation when turning up.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
For the advocates of a relaxation of the restrictions for the device usage through passengers, Amazon.com counts.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee said mixed feelings in terms of the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd by the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes that the disturbance through the devices was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said it only occasionally reported pilots reports that speak for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to switch off the devices through the passengers in instrument landing under poor visibility.
A group of travel companies welcomed the changes and designated them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who are extensive with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA realizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in contradiction to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of U.S.Travel Association.
By air rescue service of North Sea drill islandly released bird released
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into nature again.
The water trap was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was paved by the Scottish Animal Welfare Organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This water trap was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill.
He added, "He could not fly more, which is why we were contacted for help with the request."
In your release, the water can be fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing and defining the economy to a table, which would like to change the ones who worried in the United Kingdom for prosperity and work on our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey under British business leaders and asked them what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov responded more than 1,000 executives from the economy that depict approximately the British company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow while stagnating the states in the EU.
You would like to be favored by government side new trading connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of stopping with the long and exhausting process, to reform the obscures EU institutions.
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated topics - from antitrust law to product legislation - the majority of the business leaders of the view, the control over these key competences should be retrieved according to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction on the internal market, since, according to the undertakings of the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 percent of large companies agreed to those traditionally at the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says most, revealed our survey of business leaders that a clear majority of Great Britain wishes a course towards changing the Agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade is not on politics.
This realization, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the booklet of action back to the United Kingdom.
It is about much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to an exchange of views in favor of the remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubts: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift in power relations from a renegotiation to the United Kingdom.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone moves towards a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows, which means for businesses to focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for regulations.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas;
The construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria is the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun," said CEO of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended for more variety in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensure increased risk of conventional routes, as listening to the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the transit countries linked geopolitical risks "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to discounted rates when the entire project 2015 goes into operation.
According to Gazprom, construction work should start in other subordinate countries on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: two YMCA employees accused of allegations against Jonathan Lord for sexual relics
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with children in association with children, marriage to the Children's Kinders Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission experienced for sexual abuse of children.
But in the opening declaration in front of the Commission, the YMCA had declared that one had "in the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed by a case where a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography due to children's pornography, and another, in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 because of the abuse of him.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisted by the Commission that he knew from the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion, "there had been external checks of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognized as the forefront of child safety".
Rather, evidence in front of the Commission show that the YMCA was informed that he has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Education Ministry) in August of the Year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, acknowledged, the management failed "from me to downhill" in the recruitment of Lord and not ensured that employees have been clear about their obligations, violations of the Child Safety guidelinesReport.
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sexual waste on twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare stressed that the YMCA would have a cultural problem held by the staff to report Lord's violations of the safety of children.
Employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she cared for privately as a babysitter, sitting on his lap, to a said that he liked it, and playing children with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior Lord was asked for a training for child protection, because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the Children's Manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior of Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, said, "very intimidating and most of the timewas very unapproachable ".
The managing director declared that he would not accept statements of employees, after which they did not dare to reimburse their superior report.
Instead, he said, rather have affected her friendship with Lord's judgment, which is why she had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed his view of the Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the "Jonathan Lord Case" "not reported" by employees, and the board has agreed to him.
Hare said, the decision to push the employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the occurrence of the allegations was made by the Managing Director of the Child Services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said, so that a contamination of evidence should be prevented, but what had been "overeated" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was none of the time when Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011, not for children's secure organization, Professor Stephen Smallbone explained by Griffith University, expert for sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in the attitude, review, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as a British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight to the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his withdrawal in June 2007 after a decade as a head of state, Blair has largely avoided to comment on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as the quest of the quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Eving Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that that happens, so ..."
When the horse's show experts in Shares in Cardiff come to bond the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition prevailed.
But no one was prepared for the three year old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and made his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and brought the first price - they left 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both the same size, were praised because of their occurrence, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Center near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate cap in a naughty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills when dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and have gone from the square with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, which has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells told: "The whole audience was as electrified and everyone have cheered and clapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares.
As he started, it will not last long until he is on the "horse of the year" show - and I'm sure he will cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how he has to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they were beaten and presented in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leaders - and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's sweet clothes have contributed to their part, which really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper should be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper demanded on the front page the release of a reporter, which had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The new Express resident in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to the release of the Journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But later, on television, it was admitted that he accepted bribes to fake reports on a partial company.
Now the new Express will undergo a "comprehensive rectification", the regulatory authority explained.
The "rectification arrangement" was made by the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the new Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the new Express was disordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said he had decided to "impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to escape him his reporter license".
In addition, one has "relyed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete rectification of the new Express and recommended to determine the relevant managers in the new Express and to check the lead team of the new Express immediately."
Chen had written several articles for the new Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery named Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen challenged in state television and admitted that he had published incorrect reports for a fee.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to win the trust of the public," he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame.
I realized that I acted wrong.
Following Chen's excuse, the new Express published an apology on the front page and explained that you have failed to correct the reports correctly.
Various known suspects have recently been stored on television in recent times.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a change in action at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the US and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for the drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters of measuring tunnels as one of the sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel that runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields combines warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, which makes it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, the authorities declared.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine have been ensured, the records of the court.
Three men who worked as a driver, according to the authorities, were charged with the property and the intended sale of Marihuana and Cocaine.
They threaten to a guilty prison sentence between ten years and lifelong.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on a vast subterranean network of draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth great passage, which has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana crop in Central Mexico in October, which makes the drug cartels in front of the challenge as they can quickly bring their product to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640 meter long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police admit Assange to a delivery notice
The British police today handed over a delivery notice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that one had given the 40-year-old Australian a "request to ask himself", which prompted him to appear in a police station, and added, he should not comply with him, hurt him the arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden for the indictment in a sexual allowance, after his possibilities to British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to the delivery of the beginning of the month.
As he feared, Stockholm will deliver him to the US, he had sought refuge on 19 June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "a 40-year-old man asked a request to join a time at a police station," explained a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears, he is shipped from Sweden to the United States and charged with potential spy allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the revelation website Wikileaks.
Driver, which was set with 210 km / h and hot drink between the legs, receives 1,000 £ penalty
A motorist was imposed on a penalty of £ 1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After stopping him the police, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
In front of the district court of Colchester, Howie confessed guilty without being the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted to pay costs of 90 pounds and a sacrificial surcharge of 100 £.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has proven the CGT measure, but still waits for the concluding decision of Treaskler George Osborne, which had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the 2012 budget, which costs over two million pounds, and annual fees for buyers,keep the apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the stamp tax for home ownership in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in the tax year 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, was the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber regionTaken together.
Cook said: "According to the elevations in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the associated legislation against one bypassing, it is difficult to assert high-quality real estate amounted too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained, which is concerned with the purchase of real estate in London, or holding the owner of sale," he added.
First-class real estate - the top five to ten percent of the housing market after price - in the wealthy London southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have become the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed uniform annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market", on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) An upward trend experienced such an investigation of savings.
Scientists were able to throw more light on what context the tail fronds of a dog with his mood stands.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs wedged with the tail more right (from the perspective of the dog), while it was the left side with nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist of the University of Trent, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain respond differently to stimuli, which cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs exactly as in humans, the right brain for the movement of the left side is responsible and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side tail fronds of their species, the researchers monitored the animals, while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in the one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have shown the dogs films with dogs - either a nature-stable version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog has moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the tail slope was primarily to the left (again from perspective of the dog, the wedding), her heart rate rose and she looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs learned from experience at which movements they should worry and when not.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging with the tail is linked in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side more produces a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and coaches to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest stipendate at the Faculty of Ventilology of the University of Bristol explained, this was not the first study in which was investigated whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: "Dogs rather go to a robot dog when his, tail 'wags left and did not turn right, instead of being restless - just about the other than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stir that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details must still be determined - and dogs are no exception," said Bradshaw.
Since their behavior simply can be recorded, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves into one, sometimes moving in the other direction.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will celebrate new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the peasant clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the one who choose a Pope, so Francis thus will appoint the first group of men who ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 Cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 years can no longer participate in the pope choice - that falls to a group of 120 "eligible cardinals".
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said a meeting of all Cardinals will take place before the ceremony will be held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision on the convening of the consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably have fallen until February.
He explained a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed, so that the number of cardinals eligible forks are again 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he wants.
The consistency next year is significant because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, so valero.
Currently there is a certain surplus on the ups of Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope is appointed cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to appoint the Cardinal Council of Cardinals since the formation of the Council founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mission to find opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals that should help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "good possible" that Francis the cardinals for advice please.
But so far we were not in this situation - that's all very new.
Valero said that typically the bishops were called from large places to cardinals, but Francis "full of surprises - so we do not know who he appoints".
GM returns new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat back
General Motors call back just under 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with the year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, such a communication of the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not meet the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in headrests.
"When the vehicle is pushed to the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not protect the occupants properly so that there is an increased risk of injury", was in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were made between August 1 and September 10th.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US automaker since the 2009 insolvency restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of the October over the defect.
The NHTSA was not able to examine the notification letter because of the 16-day Government Shutdown, which has a negative impact on the car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, was increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, declared GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup Trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent to the New York Stock Exchange at 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Despair of an Obama selector
I have chosen President Obama twice in hoping that change is possible
He says Obama did not make praiseworthy efforts that were thwarted by the block alignment of the Republicans
The blockade policy do not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book that I believed, it would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and describe the memoirs Barack Obama's presidential election 2008.
When I finish in the evening with my patient defrises and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when the politics were inspired by millions and robbing the breath.
The choice became a landslide victory and news spokesman held to lead the historical meaning of this hour.
My classmates cried of joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to the Office when he moved to 2008, he had approval values of 82%.
And then I conclude the book.
Switching back on the present is a bad awakening as if it is torn from a dream.
It is difficult to remember this optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder on missed possibilities.
In the years since I have given my voice for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has reached from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama bin Laden.
Also, I believe that the party-political block charity tilted too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and closing Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.
But after I defended countless times the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached my explanatory attempts at the end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade policy can not explain why one allows the listening of foreign head of state or the killing of innocent children through drones overseas.
It can not explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished, disclose state misconduct.
It can not explain why Anwar Al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without a procedure, which is why public financing and issuing limits are bypassed during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it means that the efforts of the White House for the immobilization of the media are the "aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And recently, it can not excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaign.
Obviously, the representative office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre characterize the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government himself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unbeered alternative, he did not seem to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections would fulfill the hope of which we had heard for so long.
But with the sinking of the approval values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder through this book.
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises who have dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to take a serious loss against Clinton at the preambles in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election hazards after the decision he told his employees, they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our spell," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with them more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest at the parental leave
The billionaire and deputy Clive Palmer says, Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans to parental leave, because his daughters become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining design, which is in a judicial confrontation on the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax, set up the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are painted or shortened.
But Palmer claimed that only Ministers could have conflicts of interest and the subsidiaries of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they receive a vacation or not," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission Palmer explained with 53 votes lead after the new counting officially to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer demanded a revision of the voice counting process so that this is faster.
Tony Abbotts daughters frances and bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should not we have no system in which you are marched in, the data enters into a computer, immediately chooses and then the result at 6:30 in the evening has the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils while marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can then eradify the results if you do not like it?
Totate with pencils nowadays is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently released a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that to his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very serious".
At a public office, it's about the service to the public.
"We strive for no reward except the story, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from their foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation;This is another indication that the worldwide official determination to the alleged manipulation at the currency market is rapidly picking up.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they work with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, on the daily € 5.3 billion US dollars change the owner.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal attracts the libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on suspending, confirmed this month that you have received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this topic continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators," said the bench two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation suggested that the RBS has forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and should now be assured by its current position as a European director of Forex-Spot trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was assured this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly conductive currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at standard chartered this week.
None of this dealer was accused of any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said the situation related persons.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared FINMA that they examine a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a series of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority - currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or receive information requests from authorities, said the situation familiar persons.
Banks combine instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has set the dealers in an area in turmoil, which has heard in recent years one of the most profitable investation units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricted the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid currency market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in the foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms through banks can lead to the fact that "you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out on the same day, as Credit Suisse announced, she has terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices this week after having caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has traded alone and that the matter is contaminated," explained Credit Suisse.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the government Obama: The US Supreme Court decided today that the Health Law linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces US citizens to take out health insurance by 2014 or to pay a penalty - as part of the tax authority of the state is constitutional.
The Supreme Richter John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the Richter Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also took the view that the prescription of the Health Act, according to which states either would expand the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise removed all state medicaid subsidies, is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been strained by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decidedly rejected by all leading republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the prescription campaign 2012.
Google, Samsung, sued Huawei because of Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, strained on Thursday an avalanche of complaints for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company, which was overbooked by the insolvency auction by Nortel of him.
Rockstar, the consortium bought the Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent injuries in front of the US district court in Texas.
RockStar is located in the communal property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google will be accused of patent injury in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that bring search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in accordance with the lawsuit, which hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not accessible directly.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC celebrate cell phones working with Google's Android operating system that stands in sharp competition on the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid over $ 900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and most recently offered $ 4.4 billion.
After being overbood at the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorolas library on patents.
"Although Google has failed with his attempt to acquire the action patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the refusal.
Rockstar calls for a high degree of compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentionally, so the allegation.
Egypt sworn-up first freely chosen president
Mohammed Mursi issues the right of office, but his day of the triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in the country's first freely chosen president and thus the succession of Husni Mubarak antrat, which had been expelled from the Office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist President of the Arab World and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the Eid in front of the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is modeled on an antique Egyptian temple.
"We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live in state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people has laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, a USA trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group since its founding84 years ago mostly as a forbidden organization was focused on the respective government focused.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small autoconvo shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential splendor from the Mubarak time, traffic was stopped for a short time, so that the autoconvo could cross the most busy road that the city center withconnects the southern suburbs.
As a uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of Islamists, but of all those, the efforts of the uprising from 2011 against the authoritarian MubarakTargeted to bring.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained the Mursi dressed in a blue suit with red tie, the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he deposited his office.
Later, Mursi drove to the University of Cairo, where he should hold his way of experience.
He was officially welcomed by an Army Capelle, who played the national anthem he listened in Habattan.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival he was greeted by hundreds of hundreds in the largest lecture hall of the university with speeches of "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi lay on Friday a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led Mubaraks to the end of the authoritarian rule last year, and he praised, praised, presidential power powers recovered by the military council from the Office-hunted head of state.
However, with the deposit of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament he bends the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
You thought, travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Center seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from travelers to Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its earlier prognosis.
When the current target values are achieved, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Center achieved eight percent gain in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British Private Business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are in good way towards record year's revenues before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest earnings carriers.
In Australia, the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which has a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it ran for the leisure business from Flight Center in the United Kingdom, while the business customers were less expenses here.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
The shares of Flight Center rose yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature, students in the future must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the exam also find "unseen texts" input to stimulate a broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students have to store a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first compartments radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, OFQUAL, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we have to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," where he emphasized the GCSes would be "challenging, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools, less time for mathematics is spent - 116 hours per year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach average 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there is no formal requirement to provide more time in the timetable for mathematics, but from coalition circles, it is said that the comprehensive math exam - combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in ranking - will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The curriculum focuses on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.

On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr.Georges Bwelle brings free medical help in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr.Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $ 250,000 to the continuation of his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father had always lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the funds to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 at a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital City of Cameruns.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then inflammation, which expanded to his brain and caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have published him from Cameroon when we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years to accompany his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first, and is not first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for you, most cameruners could not afford the visit.
Two of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem you have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle the decision tire to do something about it.
Dr.Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called Ascovime, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he conscances and up to 30 people in minibuses and drive with the tacked medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages, the help.
Not always everything runs smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with its wide smile and its boundless energy - is happy to be at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team begins with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and walk.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated because of malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for the school, but many poor families just can not afford.
In the evening, the team executes simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment;After the procedure, patients are up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so works Bwelle and his volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an exhausting pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drums all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then goes back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students - performed 700 free operations last year and knows that they work with their work a tremendous difference for the people they help.
A man explained that the free operation of a groin, which he received, now enabled him to work again.
"That changed the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.

Most citizens could receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper as predicted.
"You come a better deal," he said.

"I want to tell these Americans directly: they earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, which is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the start of the online platform has been "miserabel" since October.
"I'm just frustrated and angry like everyone else too," she said.
I am determined to recover your trust.

We actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people prevented because we have learned in advance of such plans.

Other revelations quoted from Snowden shared documents, after which the NSA has monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage in allies as necessary and explained, this is customary on both sides.

He said the exact travel route will be worked out.
While Murphy stressed, the purpose of the journey was the improvement of relationships, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments would have to be honest with their population about the kind of espionage programs they for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is a journey in the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grudge about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
