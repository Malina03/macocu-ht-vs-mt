Gutach: Even more security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian light on the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older townshallamel.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or turtle strike?
This question has answered Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Town Hallamel has been installed at that time because it secures the way of school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists as well as bus carriers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the intersection Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa parks, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area> grub <.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian, there had been another traffic light for their safety," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles through the B 33 pass the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy duty," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is just here," says Arnold.
Overall, four traffic shows have been carried out, also a roundabout was considered, but again discarded because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold in the location election of the traffic lights, everything was previously tested: "By means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks, we have sighted whether these vehicles can extend from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights.
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive traffic lighting itself is the "state-of-the-art, which is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which light up so strong that the lights are well recognized by motorists, for example, even with deep sun.
And it is economical as well: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the pedestrian the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the street is free, comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"Should a group or handicapped people go over the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone safely comes across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the motorists have to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely the traffic light was green for pedestrians, rushed out a luxury vehicle - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has written the need for his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village kindedness - the speechlessness, the slope to crude violence and blunt sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - has described the Carinthian poet many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prosaautor, theater texts are in his work rare.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher represents for his performance "weather lights on the tongue tip", which is now seen in the Garage X on St. Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prose texts together.
The theater maker combines about elements from the autobiographically embossed novel "of the serfs" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "corpse, his family Worry" (2003).
On the largely empty spattered stage - important props: a crumpled sofa, on which hints is copulated and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble is due to the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance overdesses the template with a wealth of directing, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come in the sometimes a little questionable scenic implementation.
They are touched hard, dipped with the head under water, stacked with their evening robes to the wall.
Stressed in cellophane or bodice, stagger on dangerous high polishes through the staging, either monologize loudly or lying completely mocked on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys this strained manner.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end is the overlapped performance of something to rest, and Winklers aftergerade absurd humor flashes.
Königsfeld: Small team beats Wacker
The volunteer fire brigade managed her autumn main rehearsal despite human beings with flying people.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate feather in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There a short circuit should be created during sawing.
Through the resulting fire and the smoke, two people were injured, but one could still send an emergency call.
Two respiratory protection carriers of the Weir made themselves prepared after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer to enter the building.
After a short time, it succeeded in finding the first person and to go into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy as a tight staircase was to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bale in it.
There were still electric machines for woodworking.
The first quenching attack was made via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
Also used in the building was a hollow beam tube.
Hans Kammerer also went to show the exercise about what is accomplished with little available staff.
In case of emergency, support is supported by the day's daily group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald Landtag President GUIDO WOLF also clarified in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce comes from tomorrow.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, together with the managing school ladders of the professional schools and the Kreisgymnasium and the parent advisory councilors, he went to this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, which introduced the networked school project educational center Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Center in the forest city.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but due to demographic change, the phase for the care of the care of relatives," explained Wolf.
He also assumed that more and more employees led to care for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But nobody could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued to say.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already met the advantages of the region during his studies, with his acquired knowledge and abilities often preserved the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the Landtag President was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places would be offered, the skilled labor demand could be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the already undertaken efforts for the expansion of public transport.
"Stay stubbornly stubborn and ensure that public transport will be better," he explained to the address of the local politician present.
Experienced an entertaining afternoon with music
Already for 15 years, the Kaul family invites the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
Previously, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the latching center.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The home dwellers were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was a sausage salad.
With common melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich underheld.
The over 100 years old natural stone wall as a front demarcation of the old schoolyard standing before the renovation to Kirchstraße is again set to the renovation cost plan of the city of Tunlingen.
In the days before the kilbig, a small angular wall, stabilization and static relief of over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade was built in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard.
The further procedure looks like Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt to involve the state monument office in the planning and create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation should be made by those skilled in the art, which should then be laid on the local council to decide and determine the further procedure on the table.
A decision about it is expected to fall within the coming year.
After the renovation, pavement and tree planting of the old school center within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future must be rehabilitated in the foreseeable future, the redevelopment wall recovery wall of the reason and set to new substructures.
The historical, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow tendency forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones witnesses of weather damage, but the wall is currently not attributable.
A stand-safe wall is a prerequisite for one of students schoolyard, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, school yard rehabilitation was even planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned issues brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school masonry renovation, which was even used for film recordings, will speak the country monument.
If there are specifications from this site, then the city of Taunlingen hopes for grants from the listing protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger elementary school, which are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions around the future of the conservatory colleges in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has turned on.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic education in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and classic are currently together at the jazz site Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the general election on 22 September, the green-red state government.
This forces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
Thereafter, among other things, the degree program Jazz and Pop will be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: "Super Tunnel" discovered to drug smuggling
In the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered a "super tunnel" to the drug smuggling and shut down.
As the US customs authorities communicated, the more than 500 meters long tube was equipped between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were detained accordingly, eight tons of marijuana as well as almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been used to the information.
"These cartels are stupid, if you think they could go through the radar," said the Attorney General of the US District Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel discoveredhad been.
On the drug bands, assured Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnels and tries to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took around a year.
The track system was equipped so that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On Mexican side is access to a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth for the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters altitude and 90 centimeter width.
He would have also been suitable for promoting illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the confiscated Marihuanas.
All three threatens as a maximum of lifelong deprivation of liberty, as civil servants said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued on the press conference in San Diego.
But the first time it was found in such a tunnel construction cocaine.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This will show the "despair" of the drug bands whose traditional routes are now cut off, Bill Sherman said of the drug-looking Dea in San Diego.
You would do everything to get to the USA.
No details were announced to the arrested, at least one of Mexican, said it.
You have to expect imprisonment up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geising festival year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning the first documentary mention is getting closer.
If the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the jubilee year is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned in documents in 794.
In churches a certificate was manufactured in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen has no hall at the moment, this opponent event will take place in the place where both was mentioned for the first time in 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in both Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Church Hausen will be the 1250 in July at a Festaming weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate recurrence.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At this festival weekend is also the church-Hausen church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote a job composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is performed on three appointments.
On June 21 together with the Sonnwendenfeier of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the arena with fireworks and on December 13, the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This is finished in the anniversary year and inaugurated, the official appointment is on the last September weekend, on the 27th and 28th of September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also published.
"But it should be a chronicle not only from Geisingen themselves, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which is just from Geisingen, church houses, Leiderdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 today's space was completed with the incorporation.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21st or 22nd November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
In 2014, however, another year is also a year with many anniversaries.
The foolship Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has on March 29 and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leiderdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leiderdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival of 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingeen was specially mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764 for the first time.
The certificate was manufactured in churches (houses), which was then court square.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate.
Reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition to the municipal form for 40 years.
Council takes on track systems
Should the rail crossing "on the deer" be rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros in the hand.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
Especially the security of rail crossings should be increased - regularly comes nationwide to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities are true of the conversion measures, they have to participate with a third at the cost, the rest shares train and waistband.
Schiltach's city tree champion Roland Groidhaber explained the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahmung "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge in the amount of the Tunnelmundes there west of the railway track.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example those that transport long wood, oncoming traffic, without having to block the tracks.
Groider therefore suggested constructing a required support wall so that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railroad crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-term transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partially transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
It should be considered that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach the case, the railroad transition "on the" Hirschen "can also be received for a longer period of time.
The councils were composed of examining which costs would cause the spread widening of the road.
Nevertheless, the remodeling of the railroad crossing was mostly approved by the proviso that the required support wall is built so that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for encounning traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railroad crossing in the tannery Trautz could arise a completely different problem, which concerns the access in the strongly rising "geroltic houses away".
The administration had to examine the conversion plans of the train from the engineering office Breinlinger, as they had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Gerolzhäuser is still possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it can not be ruled out that the tilt ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles.
The responsibility for this purpose is the city in turn as a road undertaking.
The remodeling can therefore attract adhesion disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the turn in the current expansion state worked, you should not agree to the conversion of the railroad transition, argued Haas.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition vehicle is significantly lower than at the other web transitions, because directly besides the breakpoint center is to which there is a good visibility.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision is drrewing.
By majority, the reconstruction of this railroad crossing was denied the approval, as the city of Schiltach would have the problem with siding vehicles "would pay", as the councils, as the train could retire after completion of construction work.
As unproblematic, the panel considers the conversions to the rail crossings "in Heubach" and "in front of Kuhbach", for which already intersection arrangements were made by the train.
ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European spare agency experts now need to agree on two major projects that you want to start in the next few years.
30 suggestions were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there is at least some of them living, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or to search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are just the leaders of the European Space Agency ESA.
For your program "COSMIC VISION" you are looking for ideas for two large space projects, which should make research crucially.
The budget for such "L missions" is about a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, Elite of European Space Research met in Paris in order to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas stood to debate, five of them have now come to the closer choice.
Numerous committees examined the proposals, hooks in the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision should be concluded by the scientific program committee.
A total of four big issues has selected ESA to which the missions of the 2007-initiated program "Cosmic Vision" will find answers.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that circle these stars are still in the proverbial dark.
A big infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planet, under what circumstances can live live there?
In order to pursue this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" should start, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our closer environment are examined more accurately.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and search for "biomarkers": gases that apply as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
Also, this question should ultimately provide information about which prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplary.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the ESA already has a mission of the M-Class (there is the budget for about half a billion euros) approved for this question.
The probe should start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun exactly.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and his moons.
You want to find out what role of the Giant Planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The ESA provides for the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start your trip 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is intended to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy monde Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps, deviations that could point the way to a new theory to the physicists, under their roof all known natural laws unite.
How was the universe emerged and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos emerged by the big bang.
In addition to the common matter, from the stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first-second fractions of the big bang, nor there are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclid" the ESA has already approved an M-mission, whose start is provided for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky for the first time and thus enable conclusions to the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best opportunities for a permit as a L-mission has in the opinion of many experts "E-Lisa", a sophisticated approach to the detection of gravitational waves.
Among them, physicists understand changes in the structure of the space-time, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They were not proven today.
Elisa could create this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in all.
In contrast to facilities on earth, it could also prove gravitational waves that have been created at the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the cosmos genesis.
Four more suggestions competing around the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "ICY Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a missionSurveying the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which should detect and examine Earth-like planets.
Among other things, suggestions for sample return transport from Mars, to explore moon, Venus and asteroids and solar physics.
Sprouts come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community.
Topic of the day in the municipal house were "proverbies from the Bible" and "Redebences from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the parish council, went after breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs.
"Sprouts include, regulations or warnings," she explained.
They compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible bodies and explained the meaning.
They named jurisdictions like: Wood eye be wakeful, as sheds fall from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone who gives his behavior in his sleep, his hands in innocence wash.
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners to which saying it was.
The speeches from the Middle Ages took on the parish council Christel Dehner: all good things are three, make blue, a little impregnate.
She explained meaning and origin of the phrases that she called "bridges in the past".
At the end, a raffle was raffled.
The prices were covered on a table and were destroyed humorous before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, Mayor candidate novel Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unknown in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake District, a pilot project for the tourism industry starts.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labor Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as a unknown in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to skilled workers for hotels and restaurants.
"New is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert by the Employment Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefit is varied: the participants would not have unemployed, the companies were trained professionals who were more and more lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency must not finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The number of people without a job in October is slightly falling slightly to 1.307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and better than in September, "but we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of Staff of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Because numerous companies have been responding so far with settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have little skilled workers in the craft, in the health care and in the retirement".
Seasons due to reception since September again for staff in hotel and restaurant industry.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The whole background report can be found in the Allgäu display lattice from 31.10.2013 (Page 33).
USA: Shots at the airport of Los Angeles
An unknown has fired on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport shots.
While the airport management announced about the short message service Twitter, the shooter was in custody, reported the "Los Angeles Times", the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
Media also reported several injured.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the location, said the spokesman of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewords said to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departures, as several media reported.
A traveler told the sender CNN, many people wanted to look in panic protection.
Travelers have cried screams and children.
Among the waiting panic broke out, many have hidden from fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the "Los Angeles Times".
An employee of the security authority TSA has suffered a firing injury at the foot.
The scene was "as in a movie".
After that he had been brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures was to see how many health and police cars pretended from a terminal.
Hundreds of people were safely brought out of the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special use command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management informed about Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were locked, which formed according to CNN long backs.
Except for landings, the air traffic was temporarily set, it was said.
However, at CNN, several pliers were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
The Lax Airport of Los Angeles is a largest US airport.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations from the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Songranz Dunningen will surround two services with the "German trade fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which inspired the spectators in the spring of this year, the songwriter at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 clock at the worship in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German trade fair with the original title "Sings to the celebration of the Holy Victim of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was at the time of the emergence almost as a revolutionary.
The fair is listed in the context of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis deviates more confidence
With the elections to the parish council 2015, for example, in the pastor unit Haslach (SE) is fundamentally changing.
There is then only a common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared the changes on Saturday.
For nothing more on the fundamental decisions of the diocese is to change and it is on the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as satisfactorily as possible.
During the day became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new deviates hesitantly but also a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations to the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive conversations of the six bodies reached the full-time of pastoral teams.
Regional Decesse Georg Schmitt explained the newly passed guidelines for pastoral units in the archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Thereafter, the SE Haslach as a parish in the future forms a public corporation of public law, which enter the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far.
There will be only a common parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor is represented by force.
At least two chosen members are to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes, so-called municipal teams are formed on site.
Your task will be in the future to promote the ecclesiastical life in the village.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish, there was then considerable need for conversation.
The innovations suggest that accumulated credits are preserved in the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, go to the overall community.
Especially with regard to the great planned investments, their obligation then meet all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only in projects was invested, which could be mastered by the individual parishes alone," relativized Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral assembly Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made their task in 2006, "one will remain, five" and had to find that that is not that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher pastoral unit then made themselves the questions of the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
Developments are specified in other meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the stream becomes more expensive
Citizens Pfullendorf must be set to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed opposite the Südkurier, come to a four-headed Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 euros additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This surcharge will be reset each year in October from the four operators of the large current roads.
These amount to the additional costs resulting from the energy transition, which they can collect by a surcharge over the price price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last member in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher surcharge in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out of an increase of 1 cents plus x," says bias, the number rather be near the 2 cents.
Traffic light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light is simply not green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive red?
Has an affected long enough waiting for a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorcycle".
The waiting time must be "reasonable", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to remove at least five minutes before going from a malfunction of the traffic light.
However, whoever continues the ride despite Rotlichts, must be aware that he is the full blame for a caused accident.
Who tolerates less than five minutes, may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to answer for a negligent red lighting offense.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped a little later on green.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - the fine but not.
Municipal Council is looking forward to a solid household
Whenever it goes to the household in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh good.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts already knows the administration since 2005 no longer.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with around 7.6 million euros over a millions of euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around € 1.8 million around a million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenue and the community share of income tax.
The asset household was also well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, he was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially at the higher addition from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since less investments have been planned in the financial year 2012 as planned, the reserves of the reserves has also failed.
Overall, the general reserve increased by around € 2.1 million to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"Such a work is not just shaken out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were visibly happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but that's exactly these good numbers could soon be expensive to stand.
Due to the good financial situation, the community in the past could forego high lifts.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, grants have been reduced by the country.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensation sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities need to apply for certain amounts of leases.
"We have to look at the topic of lifts, as investments are due in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermer for 60 years in the choir
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as those of the autumn-resistant, in whose frame he was solemnly honored.

The Songranz saltstetts provided with his mixed choir and women's group - the "pulse choir" - for the female quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan flavor "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "pulse choir" also reached for foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came with "What Isch the Schwob?"From Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Beer song" back in local realms, where the full mariner music association offered the crowning musical degree.

Bad-Dürrheim: A dream is true for the FC
In terms of the importance of the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf site lost nothing despite the cold weather and the rain.
A pleasant ceremony had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all those had the look, which came without umbrella or could not hold such a reason for any reason.
That went the musicians that framed the ceremony as well as so much speaker.
Wet was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
Being thanks to all the Mayor Walter Klump, who has committed greatly to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and club members who brought themselves.
Here is very particularly Lothar hero, Paul Weinzegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The spraying pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment also appreciated the state members Karl Rombach.
Further greetings Languages for the Urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southboring Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp brought in memory that recurrent weather-related influences in the spring and autumn gave the original lawn place so that he could not be recorded.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations of solving the problem, as thought of the construction of a third place in the area of the football club or at the Realschule at Salinensee.
Both were discarded again.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the establishment of a synthetic turf site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning has been included two years ago, when FC took over the pave tube in hereditary leasing, a cost sharing of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place approved and the country approved by 104 000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 the assumption of the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros, the Klumpp summarized.
The start of construction of the 68 times 108 meter artificial turf pitches took place on June 4th.
During the construction phase ongoing over three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the establishment of a Dirt-Bike route.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the topics of internal and justice.
For this purpose, the responsible working group came together in the morning in Berlin.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, Mrimensteechung and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the working group Migration and Integration also wanted to continue their advice.
Among other things, it should be about the topic of double citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany, to decide for one, end - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the subject of traffic that is not on the conference order this Friday, the SPD underpinned her no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for the danger and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his faction.
It threatens avoidance traffic on highways, which are already accident areas.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
"There is a risk that the compensation for Germans is deleted later," he said.

Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, on a day of around 200 personal calls through the speakers - it should be quieter to the airport in the future.
"It has also been found in experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time also all other information about changed flights or departure times a bit below", so Kleemann talking to the radio station.

Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quarcrave set.
Further, the vegetarian federation calls World Care Day on November 1st.
The Vegetarian Federation Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Cupan day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt lasse replace through soyjogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Brushable plant cream replace conventional whipped cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Lockers are doughs instead of with egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of dining plant and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or Seidetofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently feeding around Vegan in Germany, so pure herbal.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to your host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan was reached.
Here, there was a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special appeal in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were nearly 24 hours on their legs, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite shutdown, the Liberty Statue was reached on the second day with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went on the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of the 11th of September.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meter high viewing platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the view.
Thereafter, it went through the hectic bustle of the New York roads over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the fallson sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have come to their host families in their host families and experienced the school life at the Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien at the Hülsbergstraße, a HubertusMesse is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the legend according to a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The Hunting Horn Blower Group of the Hunt Leiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musizates on parforcehörner (nature horns in the mood) to the old, originally French melodies.
The winds carry riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog tags on towjunde musically.
The solemn fair takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
The redesigned open blow shines with a new cafe.
One, which invites you to linger and come back.
One who wants to make the name to the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu describes a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having a new situation ever experienced or seen.
In the case of the visit of the Café Café on the Oppaction in the County Town Kleve in sight to the Hochschule Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name is exactly the goal of making an actual stay not only mentally, but hand-resurrection.
Because it's just fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the open pocket 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool cafe ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team spoils the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café at the open punch: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Oppaction, the sympathetic café lovers hoped more audiences.
Last but not least through the university.
"Where we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two would like to address young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The sympathetic holder is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she reveals the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright cafe.
Better one better.
Because the harbor festival was rather held outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringatenette evening.
"Nice, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is therefore not a pronounced fan of event evenings: "You can not do it all right now".
And with an event, I always speak only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events are more likely to be the exception.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
Should mean: Déjà Vu is also for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products, which are offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the open blow in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomic parts.
To the joy of many klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastreamile and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.

Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not torn out no trees, Malmon warns in advance warning the index finger.
Many players I still trained in the A-youth.
Therefore, they are certainly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it should be seen if then reinforcement from the first is there," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of the success, the Malmon team has to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
Before all things in the cover work and the switching game, it was last haperted.
Even the opportunity recycling must be definitely better.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally have their heads free during the short break.

Thanks to the recessed at 18.5 meter recessed tub in front of the terminal, Capesize Bulkcarrier can also be handled here.
"This year we want to crack the 3-million-tonnn brand at the envelope," says Schrelle.
In addition to the EON power plant on site, the import cares go to power plants inland.
If then the GDF SUEZ power plant goes to the grid, good 5 million tons of carbon import per year are realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.

The former Bundeswehr Soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in a process agreement.

From happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail from the work of the association.
He himself was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speech, pictures were shown by the inserts on a large screen, so the guests of the anniversary event could make a picture of the aforementioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is planning now, according to Henne, to become a club in an advisory function.
In 2008, the carpenter Schreeh from Baiersbronn in the record time of almost a week has created the infirmary in Socognim, an ependary district on the edge of the capital - volunteers.
Hen also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times in which the behalf clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.

A conciliation meeting comes to an end.
In conflict, the government tax and professional football in France were maneuvered after a failed conciliation meeting in a dead end.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Parisian Élysée-Palast club and association representative and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than a million euros per year, which should pay all the companies in the country from 2014 for two years.

Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall in order to explain the planned measures to ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Häußler realized: "The ultimately decisions are the members of the municipal council".
The flood, which Gechingen met on May 15, 2009, was unprepared, had been a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häußler.
A river basidence had been commissioned with the neighboring community Aidlingen, which is now based on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many volatile properties as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
It is based on the planning of protection against a German weather service statistically all 100 years of expected flood.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge.
In experts, this is called "HQ 100aklima".
The water masses, which in 2009 in Gechingen had led to considerable damage, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aklima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the community can count on national subsidies of around 70 percent.
But the Häußler pointed out that it only give the promotion if an overall concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the community depends on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with the implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has already been presented in the municipal council in the past week (we reported) local measures in the inflow of the River IRM from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins are planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planners of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interplay of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, one was kept the most economical solution to find, so Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Displeasure prevailed at resistors of the Altort, who have always suffered even in normal thunderstorms under an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems were others than should not be mixed for flood protection and this.
The community is obliged to interpret the channel network so that two to three-year rain events could be coped.
The wastewater channels larger to dimension, millions would devour.
Seriously injured after collision
At the early Friday afternoon, two motorists have been seriously injured on the Landessstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a head-on collision.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but could first say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimonial statements that should be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old handlebar of a VW Gulf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, with the woman being so heavily trapped that the fire department needed just half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear initially.
Both crashed came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a godfinder, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have some serial.
Stunning the kinship in the outer: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as a founders and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick reads as American prophets, which is quite a bit about in one's own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffman's cassette sells two thousands with the 118 stories.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, safety delusion and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had added drugs to his brain.
He has been killed, early that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film classes such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, he exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which suits our frightening, mutants look into the future - and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals that have violated against no law," says the boss of the authority.
"We grab us, even before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society, there are no heavy criminals, but we have a penalty bearing full of pesudo criminals".They read timepieces.
They assume that bad happens, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented in action.
Dick's narration acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the abonigence of the NSA.
Anticipation of the stop: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dicks Story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more trimming more, the military controls everyday life - and what is left by the state.
Then the supervisor itself is monitored and converted to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own conditions.
Does errors and victim not only purchased, but builds on it.
The system creates the risk that fought it.
Philip K. Dick reading means, again and again, to get closer to the truth.
Spirefire statements about Merkel in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make in the US spy affair for Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel also in his Russian asylum statements.

Unknown hurt girl through shot from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That informed the police in Castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calving.
Rescue forces brought the girl into the hospital.
The shot came out of a small car that had passed on a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove away.
The Criminal Police determined, it said on Friday.
By the present time, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-affecting children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and the selfest equal removed, no property damage should be created.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were probably ignited in the city area, but here is no property damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Friend's Order Weg announced that his car wrapped with toilet paper and stolen his wheel arches.
Until the police arrival, however, the man has found his wheel arches in the immediate vicinity of all, which is why the police did not have to work further.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastic.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city, it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully they do not be afraid of spiders?" Waltraud asks Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But they know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern, in the age of the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer be able to cope with, explains them.
In addition, since a meniscus surgery, the Mentor Ziger has had to hear about its own body, which means moving with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, only a book has been published by her on the topic 'Happy living in old age - which living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going on,' she begins to tell.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today Waltraud Ries is different today.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who at all deal with the theme 'living in old age'.
Most repress it as long as it works.
Alt are always the others, "she says smiley.
Only when the suffering is really big, do you think.
'Then it can be too late, "said Ries.
In your book, the interior design is 17 residential models for a self-determined living in old age.
'Which living form you choose but is always an individual decision,' she explains.
The solution would not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the retirement powers in Tuscany or Brittany should always be considered that he could be sick too.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language one is also lonely in the Dolce Vita,' gives the professional book authorous assessments.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living forms or the often cited pensioner-wg.
Everyone has such his ticks and quirks
'For me, such a shared flat would be nothing, "she says with a wink.
Not like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'Age just needs his retreats', so Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to exclude that a senior residential community will work.
But that must then be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just just want to rest, "she believes.
At least in the state capital, she is not alone with this opinion.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as they stay in their own apartment', is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service life in the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people around the topic 'older'.
That is why older people would often also buy uncomfort and restrictions, just to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the foundation Warentest.
There are many possibilities today to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or their apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today there is also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other is realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment is old-appropriate and thus barrier-free redesign, even if she is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift within the apartment, which also with stairs paved away to the front door would be the much greater obstacle.
She will continue until she found the ideal object for himself and her husband.
Before relocation it grays more than before the spider on your home door.
US wants to pursue Snowden further criminal law
The US has not changed its attitude to the former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He would continue to accuse to have passed illegally secret information.
Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the US, said the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements from Snowden would also change nothing.
Previously, the German Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
PSAKI emphasized that Ströbele's statements are about that of a parliamentarian and not about that of a German government member.
Intelligence company Edward Snowden is basically available to a conversation with German authorities.
First, he wants to know his situation clarified.
This has made the former NSA employees sought after former NSA employees in a non-addressed letter, which published the green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, Bundestag and Bundesalbundesanwalt.
The letter has been written according to a broadcast translated by Ströbele:
To the competent
I was asked to write to you with regard to your investigation for mass surveillance.
I Hot Edward Joseph Snowden and used to be contractual or a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government, which prompted me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hazard, which forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that granted me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged from the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officers - including the United States - have the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance, which is guilty of anyone, assessed as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations attracted many proposals to new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefit for society from these gained insights is becoming increasingly clear;At the same time, the risks taken were visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government remains dissen as loyalty and strives to criminalize political expression and put it under indictment.
Nevertheless, the truth to pronounce is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government will drop this retail attitude with the support of the international community.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are enclosed, I will be able to adequately and exercise me at the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to truth and authenticity of the reports,participate.
I am looking forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden road has sold the municipality to a private person.
The sales council agreed in his recent meeting in the non-public participant.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
100 000 euros were set in the household.
It is not clear yet how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winterling has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, to look after the garden and to vacate the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.

What happens on the way with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similarly implemented as in the traditional post technically the emailing secrecy?
When designing the early Internet services was in the foreground, communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, it has not taken care of creating a stable foundation for a hilarious correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard as a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
The e-mail program or the Anna browser sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, the Google would be.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call the content with his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots.
In the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail will result in a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also made on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or washed away at least in a spam folder.
Do the robots still have another task?
For systems such as Gmail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday travel, Google can show corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons read an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to comply with electronic mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or note e-mails.
There are possible illegal spowing actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of e-mail communication, so that not even can be easily recognized, who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
For the most privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role according to an examination of Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail were most recently, Gmail was able to increase significantly from Google.
Mother furred in the forest and conceded pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg wrested a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to conceded their pension and care allowance.

The man was suspected already in May: At that time, there was no medicines needed for the mother's nursing.
The investigators told the pensioner, his mother traveled to Spain.
Because the civil servant came strange this, they continued to determine.
It came out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had recently maintained them.

The TSV Morsum is still after six matches without any point in the Handball Association GLIGA.
It is now now comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.

"I hope we finally have my head free," says Ehlers behavior optimistic.
He has finally been available, with the exception of the permanent hendrik blohme, his complete squad available.
Also Daverden puts like us on tempo game.
Therefore, we have to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in the cover, which has last left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against North Horn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we are not the favorite for a long time, because in the derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to make in Morsum to start a series.
Will Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-adolescent Joost is celebrating his sacred debut with double game law at the A-Youth Bundesliga club.
Who is not hot in such a game, should stay at home.

The rescue workers mount a charred body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident Handle still unclear how a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said.

Germany's largest regional church has an offensive style to advertise for the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible parish deficiency: The Evangelical-Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors to be halved by 2030.
For young people from today, the profession is very attractive and offered good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Protestant Press Service.
It is attractive to determine the work and daily process itself.
With buffia, the regional church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people for theology studies.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Buffia leads this to the process of decorkring: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession was characterized by great freedom and variety.
I am Lord of my appointment calendar and can put my focal points where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors.
She deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Certainly more paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a secure employer.
Come on the young people from today, which it is not just about career, but about a sinner-filled work.
According to the regional church, which includes three districts of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their Vikariat.
In sparsely populated edge areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it can be difficult to occupy places.
Burfies, among other things, wants to organize study days for young people and invite prominent who studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, Mitgeriste BVB trailers with light trays had taken care of for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday Game of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost spooky acoustics, which offered the viewer until just before the kick-off of the Bundesliga game between the German Vizemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park Signal Iduna Park.
Listening were predominantly the guest fans with their songs.
The southstandue, on the other hand, where the most loyalist of the loyal - and loudest - bvb fans stand, presented themselves exceptionally quiet: no songs, no battles.
The podium of the Capo, who otherwise coordinated joint management, remained unoccupied.
And at the top of the tribune, lonely a large flag wove with inscription "Section Stadionbot".
Only as a goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the square, branded short-term cheers.
When his team colleagues followed, there were vocal singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southstanding tribune, nothing raining.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract renewal of coach Jürgen Klopp - enabled, did not cause a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the kick-off of the Capo, the Capo directed his podium - and the hitherto goes almost with his hands tangible tension unloaded in a loud scream, as a thickness as usual the mood on the ranks in the stadium interrogated.
Lastly, as always, the south slurry was on the turn - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest as with kick-off by the southstandue the loud prompt "DerBy winner stands on" came again everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the caterpicuous BVB trailers had fired light trays in the viewer ranks and on the place - and struck almost goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller.
The game was spoiled late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzkes words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"It will give massive cuts for the entire ultra-off way," announced the BVB boss on Thursday night on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate action, Watzke prohibited the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbidden that," he explained.
We can not give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the coming week.
"That will be crazy," Watzke assured.
It is allowed to be curious how the reactions on the south slurry then fail.

Veganism is assumed to vegetarianism, according to Lexika, but differs from this but in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream pie, ice or a strong edamer, these gourmets are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, beside the waiver of meat and fish, the veg is leaving all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, you may ask yourself, but with closer consideration, the vegan nutritional world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Broad screens are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health care store who holds a variety of special products for Vegans.
Reuben Proctor also visits the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander Vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live."In 1997, I turned my diet and became vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became Vegan.
"The conviction was not only because of the diet, but due to the choice of choice," says Proctor, which prefers faux leather normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday respects without animal products.
First and foremost, Vegan is an ethics.
"I do not want animals to die for me," Proctor speaks the maxim of the vegans that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of bringing behind burgers, scrambled eggs or gummears, the vegans quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm rose.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "In fact, Vegan does not give any waiver, no asceticism, but it is an enrichment".The assumption that you reduce the selection of food options with the nutritional change, Proctor rather returns to the power of the habit.
And that's exactly these conditioning also made some likely to fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that can give up many quickly, much like smoking," Proctor presents a comparison.
And turns on: "Certain tastes are not tight to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also generate the same effect in other ways," illustrates the vegans.
For example, Proctor brings a barbecue, mushrooms, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should often taste hearty.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that's not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread adoption, he did not suffer.
For me, the conversion had a positive aspect.
I do not take a strange cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I'll let me check," reveals Proctor.
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"Since animals are nourished with feed, instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the freezer is high, the vitamin B12 content is high," the Proctor finds.
For vegans, it also has the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are alright," he explains.
Wide paths must not go Proctor for food procurement.
There are staple foods everywhere everywhere and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.
All I need, I find on site.
Only now and then do I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is known to" ordinary "finished products known as well".
In any case, the preparation of Vegan courts is far more favorable and less time consuming than commonly accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchenette, with a few small tricks you can do good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbonated instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake Proctor could also marvel his in-laws.
Family festivals gives the vegans a new seasoning.
This has dynamics when cooking together has a new job.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, however, skepticism was given to him.
Do not you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now, because I drink milk?"- In such questions, one must act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this company," Proctor does not want to deaden an enclavease.
And more detailed, the everyday world does not seem so vegan food as suspected - and the vegan is not so limited in everyday life as commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Spommes is available everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on.
"When I started eating Vegan for 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can locate a development: "You have to talk to the people, making them drawing attention to them".
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the café bird-free.
Proctor hangs out the desire that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they conclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the biggest part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
But the purchasing of vegan products could be slightly difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand, which also contains in peanuts of animal additives as a covers, it seems to be followed by the observation of ethics with so many hurdles and quickly falling to leave the courage.
Not only therefore Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that food is also buried cleaning agents.
"Gradually, one develops a scanner view and knows what signs and logos you have to pay attention" It is sometimes better small steps to do to stop or stumble, "White Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral finger shoe beating on consciousness.
Maybe he does not quite manage that one does his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.

Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the construction fence on the Bechtle property at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the back of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a transparent with the message "We have been" attached.
However, the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative bothered little to their action.
Her motto on the big poster was called "We are against Bauruinen".
Thus, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project someday fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that it will be better with the realization of the project of the city many, although not a few have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented like the BI.
But they begin to resignate because the city delays these answers further, it is on the side of the BI.
How to hear was also the public statements of the mayor affect.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he fears that for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Therefore, some appear scared, others feel them as a "clumps blackmail attempt" on the population, it continues in the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick-shell for Schiris: Man no swallow king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current highly form of Bundesliga league leaders Red Bull Salzburg is too disappointed, the sports director of the "bulls" was shown by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category Schwalbenkönige," he took the two offensive spiritors on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became an alleged acting for fate - which, of course, did not show how the TV images showed.
"A crass wrong decision," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam called "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game contributed.
He defended his German compatriot de decided: "I would have behave in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I would not know why.
"Because I am the one who was insulted," emphasized the 46-year-old.
In view of the success run, Rangnick agreed a lobeside.
"There are only two words: really good," he said.
There is not much to suspend.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
That should go on a while.
Cader changes in the winter transfer time would hardly give it.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except a player approaches the desire to leave the club," Rangnick realized.
Norway: Norwegian place is making lights with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village of light have brought into their gloomy valley.
Because of the low sunlight grade, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley normally sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century room was true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the starting ceremony in the station TV2.
Some valley people caught sanning chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety's sake.
So far, sun hunger had to drive in winter with a cable car on a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council eventually adopted the 5 million crowns (around € 615,000) expensive project.
A similar construction has been giving up the Italian Alport Viganella Winter Sunshine for several years.
Post empties barely Sundays
"Many citizens are not noticed yet, the red points for the Sunday leech are still available at various mailboxes of the core town and the neighborhoods, but read the fine print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you can quickly find out that emptyingSundays and public holidays no longer takes place, "says the FDP with.
An inquiry of the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and public holidays, only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten also Sunday is emptied, the FDP is not answered in the answer to the request.
The Social and Youth Policy Speakers of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch here.
The Sunday leech is just an important post office at Appointment Post.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this venture is radical and unreasonable.
Thomas Bittner, Fractions and City Association Chairman of Liberals, supports his group colleagues: "What agree with me is the fact that the empty times are changed or canceled here Klammheimlich the empty times.
From citizenship, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes have to be emptied in the districts of Nice and Rosengarten again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unison.
Also for the core town, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to reach a mailbox with Sunday leech within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament, whether the city administration talks with the post office about this thing.
Mayor Erich Maier answered, the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But there is also a Sunday leech in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatizations.
"Then make decisions elsewhere," Maier said.

In December, the city council must decide then.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt holds the "for no good idea".

The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "quite adequate and long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.

With the hard and placed surcharges, the Gönninger did extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks cleaned by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not on the spot during the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all matters.
In view of this crushing and game-determining performance, the third set was won slightly and lustlessly to the 3-0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2nd with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a highly competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused the ball and point sectors especially in the ball acceptance;Even with the passports, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes, the excipient prevented the view for possible puncture gains.
In this performance very balanced encounter, however, in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, the great physical commitment and a pleasing engagement of both teams agreed.

In this planning, the current measure is not only seamlessly paste.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to the LIFE project and the pastary days achieved for the future.

The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The old man and the sea", Horst Janson is cut on the body.
Janson is an old bunny in his profession, the acting art.
Nobody can do something to the old man Santiago.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost meant to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fishing boy manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, that's really at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellent masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a bold man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is in width stretching as a single-actor on stage.
He manages to focus on the attention of the audience, so that his monologues are no moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish on the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village act.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who with her songs and its magnificent voice the sense of life Cuba states.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length below Cologne, a wastewater canal from Roman times is preserved.
Who visits Cologne, does not pass by the cathedral.
Around 157 meters protrude the two towers in the sky and make him the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Kölner Underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly on the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-oriented city, and therefore only that remained from the remains of the old city wall, which was not too big.
Most of the users of the car park therefore rush past the Roman remains today and just off their car.
But those who look more closely, discovered in the parking deck D2 a archaeological site separated by metal grid bars.
To see are about five meters high ruins of manual sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city wall, built in the second half of the first century to Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze gives the participants on the upper park level still take a look into a dark, 15-meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly perceived.
Next station of the tour is the pretassium, and here the participants rise down to the depth.
Here we experience the official residence of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for" Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium ", which is in good German as much as" City of Roman Right and City of the Agrippinerser, founded under Kaiser Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult "means".
And the pretassium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is retained to about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Kulze Muds the guests.
A surprise has Schulze nor.
After brought the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16-meter deep, walk-in slot.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built her bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washes.
To date, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels are readable by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of an archaeological zone on the Rathausplatz, for which the construction will begin soon.
Until completion, however, a few years will be passed.
Leg almost chopped: New edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in Rockermilieu is completely rolled up after more than four years.
A process for tried manslaughter, dangerous personal injury and property damage against two 30-year-old has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (or).
He is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent at the beginning.
They should have been active in the rockers scene and belonged to the bandidos at that time.
The public prosecutor's office accuses you, in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men in a car in a car to have taken.
All victims were seriously injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims are to belong to the competing group Hells Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
A precisely one was a chase with several cars.
According to the charge, it was about cramps and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been acquitted in early 2012 in a first procedure.
A court spokesman said then, it could not be proved that men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice raised the verdict after the revision of the prosecutor's office and rejected it back to the district court for the renewed negotiation.
One of the defendants is currently because of another offense in the open execution.
At the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tice Night.
As a witness, the then determined commissioner was invited.
In the center were mobile phone talks of the defendants and other persons who had taken off the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law for you in court - and not statements.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier by the public prosecutor's office Frankfurt (Oder) told Demand, there have been new traces since the last procedure.
For the process eleven further negotiation days are scheduled.
The disposable company does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood well, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Sure, one or the other cocktail or champagne may be responsible!
What's closer to go to the next drive-in to drive a little something?
I admit, I like to join in when it goes to fast food and early morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like off home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco turners are noticeable.
Because what does something have to be missing that one throws its fastfood bags from the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on the weekends lie-thrown paper bags on street margins and parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are the people to stupid to take the bags with home or take to the nearest trash can?
It's not just that the paper is shaping the landscape.
Bags have already obscured transport facilities such as guardrails and thereby triggered accidents.
But what did said "Disposable Company" did not think, probably she does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are traveling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a back seat can look like by passing nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage towers there.
There would be a few bags more or less but also nothing - in contrast to the road where no one wants to rum on the food residues of other around.
I see the day, where the cities and municipalities will be too stupid to the cities and municipalities - and demand the Fastfood chains for their bags deposit.
Government in Jerusalem confirms Attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous has claimed the American news channel CNN on Thursday, Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in Syrian Latakia a day before.
The aim was "missiles and associated equipment", of which the Israeli government feared, they had been intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, it was said according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcasters Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was bombarded on Thursday at night from Wednesday, and the Israelis was responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defenses of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were to be seen, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and explosive heads up to 70 kilogramscan transport.
Uncertain the government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters also quotes an anonymous Israeli government officials with the words, he believes that Israel has made the attack, but is not sure.
Another speaker of the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime was already trying to supply soil-air missiles to the Hezbollah earlier, sometimes successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt of Syria to provide Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means exceeding a "red line" that would follow a military answer.
A stubborn violation on the ankle is threatened to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz bnages around a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will decide on his commitment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal scorer with six hits.
Because the Mainz must already do without the injured power carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
