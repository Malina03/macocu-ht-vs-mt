Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
In the encounter, however, it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and raises Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
Due to the Deal advertised by Obama around the Iranian atomic program, the relationship of the two has further worsened.
In March, Netanyahu had a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly evaluated as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming choice in Israel.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here at Hobookenweg is the most expensive condominium - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a ready roof house costs average 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says in the study - that's why the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student build in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top residential locations, one of the price is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residence locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several ten thousand euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford ...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two scorer in Piraeus: Bavaria Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern for a deserved 3: 0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have gave FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the hex chain of Piraeus.
The crew of coach Pep Guardiola won her starting game in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes Hits (89.) earned 3-0 (0: 0).
The twelfth starter success in series should be the first step towards Final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third start.
Müller received with his 28th hit in the Champions League to Bayern Guidance, with the help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who had a whimpered shot of the World Champion passed as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria-Captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich held word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the premier class, including well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund stumbled here (1: 3).
But Bayern undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams did not want to be the next sacrifice.
They went brave ran, but often to work with their offensive efforts.
The attacks were initiated too often by game relocation on left outside Douglas Costa, who rarely crossed against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right, as his flank from the right half-field in the upper left torque.
In the 67th minute, the world champion awarded the possible 2-0.
The best occasions in half had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the header of the Poland from the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto parished with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised her usual dominant game, Piraeus could set needlesticks.
But on goalkeeper Manuel new was rated.
So as he directed a shot of ideeye over the latte (56.).
Before newer, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center to defend beside Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat first outside.
The World Cup hero had only given green light after graduation training, said sports board Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to do something different, that's malicious".
Also at the first change Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the struck Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clearly 13 minutes later, with a penalty Müller put another on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly muted Bavaria fans in their viewer block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went with punching sticks against the Munich trailer.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured out of the stadium.
Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes, not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: For waiver, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Nutrition Research Institute (DIFE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers have the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had watched more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes for tooth loss were toothy and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIFE.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore more frequent tooth military inflammation in smokers.
Not clarified to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to the level of non-smokers sink, steamed Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince people of becoming non-smokers, explained Studies Heiner Boeing from the Dife: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our findings to a good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years affected by tentlessness, the DIFE announced.
Previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpin the findings.
Archaeologists encounter Kölner Rhineufer on residues from late antiques
Repeatedly, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Close to the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said Museumsleiter Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called bodenning monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialized office for archaeological chamber maintenance.
In the third construction phase of the Rhineboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents have already been known that at the point in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, Trier explained.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery had also been discovered with around 350 graves, which belonged to the church.

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private conciliation facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning is significantly more traditional dishes.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedine intended to introduce the proposal as a European negotiation position in free trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
Through TTIP, the largest free trade zone of the world is created with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration concrete suggest that the EU States and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is provided for the first time.
It would allow to object against judgments.
So far, the procedural participants agreed with each other for referees, an objection to their judgments did not exist.
In the discussion of the past few months, it has become clear that citizens were not familiar to the old ISDS system in fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an international investment court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified.
The investor state arbitration procedures (ISDS) required mainly of large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration dishes are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justification, through which companies compelled damages at the expenses of taxpayers, to highlight national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations, such as Campact, designated the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
Above all, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German Business State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account significant points in the reform that Federal Ministers Minister Sigmar Gabriel has developed in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitrations is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Association BUSINESEUROPE warned against limiting the purchase opportunities of the economy through too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it was said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed, remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been running since mid-2013.
However, the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should be already at the end of this year.
This date is considered no longer durable.
Delicate Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Stevens's lecture.
He tells of various places, which he repeatedly signs on the map, which reports his minucious and tenderly arranged songs.
Where they were created and how it looks there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be wonderfully creative.
With the 2003 published and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", Klug seemed to compose songs that harmoniously closely close to American folk of the late sixties, but at any time can drift into the great opulent.
The rumor arises, "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 US states should be considered in a row.
But already in 2004 and in the Rhein near the Rhein already published "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduces Stevens appears here.
LIVE complies with Guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You to: Come On Feel the Illinoise"), a nationwide celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overbound to ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises in the American billboard charts and is not missing in no annual best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then serves very extensive electronic offset pieces on "The Age of ADZ" (2010).
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Given the smaller club, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon-headbands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Currently Tours Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-member band through Germany.
More in the dark Hamburger!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although there are now nearly 2000 guests spelled in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to address the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "opulent" and you could make the "plate basically throw away".
Only an adding thanks to Stevens is modest, acoustically few older songs plays and finally bounds under tugging applause.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 years young, a hanging with Oberschicker Frize.
The type with the platinum blond hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
How Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
For 7 am, however, the Polin sits on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin's luxury hotel am Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber construction: Here you live idol, whose posters hang up in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much as her mum Ewa deserves half a year.
If any.
That says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the high school."
"I fulfill her a dream".
Compulsory education?
Who cares?
The fans do not.
Bieber himself is not.
He suffered anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl, he conceded three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company rinsed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with each doll that looks like he and goes over the counter, Bieber concedes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, it is stunted on the windowpane.
He should have caught more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize, Bieber is finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?"On place 1.
Bieber himself whose fourth album should follow in November, the many zeros are not interested in the first time.
At least he does so.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato monastery idea
Potatoes or kebab?
It works both - in the potato monaster who developed the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "Potato instead of doner" on a poster of Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat put together on a skewer.
On the idea, a poster brought him to a pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of doner", which he had randomly seen on television.
Since then, there is a grill spit in his store, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has meant by Lebanese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes of the spit contains, Alhay does not want to reveal.
Only as much: "It tastes even better," he finds.
Even with his customers, the culinary international understanding come well.

Functional of AICH / DOB due to infidelity in court
At Landgericht Klagenfurt, two functionaries of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion AICH / DOB have responded on Wednesday for infidelity and tax deduction.
The defendants are not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with offset abuse.
From this reproach he has been relatively acquitted in May.
The current process was postponed.
According to the Attorney of Attorney Robert Riffel, the preliminary examination had warned that the defendants in the years 2006 to 2011 were used for private purposes for private purposes in 2006 to 2011.
He estimates the damage with around 400,000 euros.
The sports officers are also charged with financial losses.
This fact left the chairman of the Schöffenenenat, judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
The defense was the defense that the association had never been awarded to the association.
The sports officials would have charged only expense compensation and the sports club, for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (approx. 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we stood in front of the situation: Let's keep the club further or unlock?", One of the defendants told, in the breadcard wholesale operator of the financial office.
He decided to take this task with his colleague and co-defendants.
With all the risks.
"We pushed money, putting our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the interrelation.
With the club was arranged: You can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
Furthermore, in the case of a corresponding financial loss, the payment of the expense allowances were decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, one has paid a part of the expense compensation for years later, namely from 2003, as a plus in the account, paid off.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed bookings also seemed, the former chairman explained the operations.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
Why the payouts were not revealed in detail to the club, the judge asked.
The club did not interest in detail for finance, important was only the freedom of debt, so the answer.
When in 2011 against the a functionary investigation on abuse of abuse, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
That had been reserves, explained the defendants.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to its statement, was unknown to the club.
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
Then the respondent did not know any answer.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody knew anything about this money, the prosecutor in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official was justified.
This transfer was formulated as a "claims reparation".
Why damage?, Wanted judge and prosecutor knowledge.
The first defendant explained that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never caused damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With them all from the tailor".
"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.
Furthermore, the official said he had never compared a cent salary, he just offset only mileage and diets.
At diets, he billed to the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not show the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an audit, in which everything was judged correctly, they explained.
Mileage money had also referred to the second defendant.
All assignments are in cash, for this he had to drive from his place of residence to Bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.

With the pilot union, there are new negotiations.
The Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the budget subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is a contribution to earnings of around 500 million euros per year from cost and elevatories, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will not exist in the future for the passenger business in the future.
The low cost flight line Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board team for Chef Carsten Spohr will be responsible for Charles Ulrich Garnadt for Eurowings.
With the reissue, SPOHR underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.

Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Central Franconian Eckental townhouses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need residence, but also the single mother and the low earner."
"I show how to build cheap and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are pushing on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created: he builds in a project in terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are pushed on the housing market.
Which solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people remain a large part here.
Given the refugee stream we also need enough living space in the coming decades.
A whole banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different, if you make people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses, which are just built in the pilot project, consists of three units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
GILDNER: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without property.
This is manageable.
Six months took the construction.
That's appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated your plans?
Gildner: Build-up rights I have pulled my project correctly.
Especially complicated makes it always the impending Damocleshsword special construction and the pitch ordinance.
Creepy.
It is still assumed who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is missing the place.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is not right.
But do not tighten the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We had a construction room in Germany over the past five years, but were built luxury apartments that can hardly afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the sole parent or the low earner.
I show how you can also build cheap and well today.
It's all about this.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyzes.
Rosberg's sole motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton only a motto: "Full Attack".

Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstandausen.
Sambermeldeister Bernd Bormann, economic promotional Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.

After a conversion phase, Müller opens the practice on the 12th of October again, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felthausens years ago Frank Müller and his wifeMeeting Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently completed their specialist training in the Verden Hospital and wants to enter the practice for the coming year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr.Ursel Felsausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in Asendorf.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage, he also see his own boss soon.
And so you agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
You will continue to stay in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.

During the surgeon.Karl-Heinrich Felistausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle as partencies.
"The endoscopy is therefore out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consulting room anymore.
In addition, the EDP is completely renewed.
A grant of a total of 50000 euros will receive the Müllers as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued," emphasizes Samtgemebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll every quarter, come to the practice of Felisausen, in the North German average practice it is about 500.
There is another family doctoral practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical assumption through Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstansausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found, she would have gone.
Incidentally, if you visit Müller's consultation, also looks mainly in trusted faces: Take over the seven medical employees and the cleaning power of the Felthausens.
With their say goodbye ends an era in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced for 30 years.
"At the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel remembers Felistausen.
A little sadness is already feeling after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients often," says the internist.
Your husband complements laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter property."
"So far I have always pushed myself before gardening, now that could be different".
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and travels.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees by"
"Now the border controls are also up to our south border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also make this "self-evident".
The care and safety of people is in the foreground.
Of course, "that it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept limitless migration streams, either about the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously been communicated to continue Slovenia wool incoming refugees towards Austria and Germany and may also build corridors for the refugees.
Thus, this is the Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach, however.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia is already highly controlled as an external boundary of the Schengenraum.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenin wants his boundaries for refugees but does not get abrasion.
"Every EU member must fill out his obligations, otherwise the system can not work," emphasized Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to arrive past the border crossing Tovarnik / Sid in Eastern Croatia to avoid the registration.
The Croatian police could pick up them in the near corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles have been constantly meeting in Croatian Tovarnik with new refugees.
It mainly deals with Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Also rescue services and the red cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from presevo would be redirected to the Macedonian Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, direction Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it was to assess the people of evidence of certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports, at least a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Sid had arrived, during the day further buses would expect.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometers away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has admitted, so the police said to us that we should drive here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
Thus, it could actually come to a slightly further west route to the previously predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
For details, he did not call, but he pointed out that Croatia has as a non-Schengen member "comprehensive border control opportunities".
You can carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengenraum.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have passed the country through a good testimony since then, which relates to the standard of border controls.
On Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence continues to stuck about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local eye certificate in Horgos: He hold the debates over alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, for premature.
It would not be very high refugee numbers.
You can not say if you would continue your journey about Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helper advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee herself have already begun to spread to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: In parts of the border area, there are still non-cleared mining fields for 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent in the border region.

Again and again, small discussions on the action are developing on themselves, about life, dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that for me at some point the end of the world comes in this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which is together with the Caritas Association carrier of ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this publicity action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, that not everyone wants to communicate on the panels in public, but it is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and dying is still with tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement has contributed much in recent years, that people open.
An assessment sharing Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Confronted by personal experience with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death harrow.
When the ecumenical hospice assistance was called volunteered by call, she reported immediately and had been there in the beginning of 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected person and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and accompanied in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
All they are trained carefully.
Angelika Godefroid can handle your task and the experience and experiences made with your task.

Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made one exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-privileged gym construction on Bernrieder Sports premises are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the prepared construction proposal has been set up unanimously.
Previously, among other things, the body had a request for a building law "exception" or "liberation" by the valid development plan.
In the "exception", it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with non-center first and roof supernatant" should be built.
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully great south roof together," said mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In the "liberation", in turn, it was about the roof pitch, which is intended for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof tendency does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernrieder municipal council usually proceeds more restrictively in liberation requests.
However, the gym construction is no recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym construction at the sports center is a community project of the community and SV Bernried.
At cost around 2.3 million euros are acquired.
Grants are expected from school and latitude support.
In the next step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for review.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Hospital Peißenberg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time Dr.Wilhelm Fischer (66) New Medical Director at Hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
Seeing the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the district, the Landrient Andrea Jochner-White confirmed.
However, a decision to meet the Supervisory Board, and the day next Wednesday, September 23.
Should the plans be implemented, then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg were further employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the further existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who can not go to Schongau is to be offered in Weilheim a workplace, so Jochner-White.
The employees are informed about the plans.
Triggered the change the termination of Dr. med.Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who succeeds in succession, according to Jochner-knows, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who agreed to take on the management from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means an "enhancement" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", so Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the inner station.
Transition for the next two years, Fischer is to be with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses, until next year, the former hospital of scarcity, which still has more than 35 beds, is finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 if the current renovation at the Hospital Weilheim has completed.
Landrätin Jochner-White, which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, responded rumors, after which the house, which is owned by the Federal Bag Society, should be used in the future as a property for asylum wire.
"That's what I conclude".As it continues with the property, Jochner-knows could not say it gives several considerations.
Currently there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the quasi movement to the Lech, which had been received by the employees "positive and very understanding".
A true perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years, did not exist.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) had been threatened with closure over the past decades, departments were closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are demanded tonight (20.15 pm) in the Bergische HC.

Refugees need accommodations: Study warns of the apartment gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
Even more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place.
The pressure on the housing market grows.
Social housing is a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the incoming refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many big cities.
They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built until 2020 every year.
To this result comes a study on behalf of the Mumbishing Bank "Social Housing".
For comparison, 260,000 units are finished this year.
This lacks 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are no longer obliged after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in a first reception accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and arrive in the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising refugee numbers.
The study also issues significant failures in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany pushes a residential deficit getting bigger from year to year.
Currently there were already around 770,000 residential units in the metropolitan areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore lived in large cities of emergencies in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama" because of the lull on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita had fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" suggests a restart.
New incentives should boost social housing again.
Thus, the basic employment tax could be dispensed with and the property tax for funded apartments are suspended.
In addition, according to alliance attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
The funding program for refugee accommodations of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and communities.
A good week after the start was recalled on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have compiled: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary is practically no more getting through, because more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces that the transit across Slovenia to the north without hurdles to grant.
Dangerous is the route but still.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring Lovenia neighbor about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Minister of Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country yet.
After the foreclosure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees broke into Croatia to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television transmitter RTL.
Hungary had bounded his border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can go through, and we prepare for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to achieve life and something.
However, people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighboring country in the morning.
Most of the media reports, according to Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came by bus as well as taxis in the Serbian border town SID.
Immediately after her arrival, they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border strip holds other dangers: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Mine clearer should now quickly create a secure passage.
According to Hungary, there are hardly any refugees after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 caught people.
Shortly before the trunk on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws occupy overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offense.
In the southern border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were already initiated.
The sentenced impulses of imprisonment of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the new "transitones" established on the border, almost all - 93 - most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants 13 families with small children and two older people are.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stopped there.
Virtually nobody has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
After Hungarian view, Serbia is a "secure third country".
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "Treitzer" in Röszke.
In Röszke workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage, the tens of thousands of people left the roadside in recent weeks.
Blocking grid were reduced and one of the recording bearings in the border location was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on this conversion.
Austria is only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
The 20,000 migrants were still in the country for government information.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on statement of German authorities.
In freilassing regularly met smaller groups of refugees on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" over the border
"We were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday with the cleaning up, as suddenly ten people stood with travel cases at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
But because of the railway traffic with Austria had surprisingly discontinued on Sunday, but was finished in Wernstein, "said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we have the unexpected guests to be greatized, with snack and drinks.
We said immediately, we bring you to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the Oön conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not let it take to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"That was very happy," says Stadler.
The stranded tensile passengers were transferred from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, for the short-term proclamation that the rail traffic was set to Germany, but still to try across the border.
The regional train was parked before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Bridge Festival Association with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociable, tags previously a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has moved highly efficient and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the Dadkreis of National Socialism.
The suffering of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
Even the refugee will have to find that the "praised land" that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a big challenge, given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter, with us to produce decent conditions for protective seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-resistant quarters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugee support.
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight.
The government has used the former mighty Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first-release center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad already under control.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he reported from his first success.
Even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, which had come to Austria on Monday, was without much vortex, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in the heurig year.
In order to fulfill the number, 35,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries, 15,000 the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already led talks with the Governments.
These would have assured him to also create quarters for the upcoming refugees.
"In Upper Austria, it's fine," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, while it should be clarified as the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "How we".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
It also hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In nitles, it could not be that neighborhood must comply with a certain amount of towel rail or size of the skylights.
For a temporary time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of Interior in the accommodation, he was more successful, establishes Konrad with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not without further face the capacity of the untruth.
Persion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier cause the republic no costs as they declared themselves.
Your number of employees will increase them to three to four.
The own quarters search was not successful so far.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on the Stephansplatz as a office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommodating refugees plans the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, because they could currently accommodate those affected without these measures, Mayor Klaus Luger (SP) says.
For emergencies, however, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
Criticism, the city boss practices the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) has accorded the further procedure in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German limits are not locked.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not give any more.
However, the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Of the other EU member states, Pühringer once demanded more intensified solidarity in the refugee question.
The fact that Austria introduces to its borders again controls is for Pühringer "a logical sequence" from the procedure of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "new shipyard" in the Linz Industrie line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stockoomed IT Group has moved in S & T, the rest (2700 square meters) should be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology area.
"In IT, the clever heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T-boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the new shipyard and later acquire to acquire.
Already from the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the TechCenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Bund (FFG).

Previously, several weeks was rebuilt.
"But I have long thought about whether I should open a shop," says wide.
Decisive for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also done by the idea of their own location, which only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz, who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters that himself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been broadly placed by her mother in the cradle.
Me's most good, when something developed and I can show new trends to affordable prices.
Why some woman with the sight of a beautiful handbag in the product, the specialist can not answer the last security.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag of each outfit is edited.
The Brulljessmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called.
This property also combines with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses themselves xenophobically, journalist male concerns or revealed knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US Presidential Office whirls up the election campaign.
And cuts well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate millageaire.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term in the wine village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200 inhabitant place is over-corners with him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed in her caller's style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädter has turned an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous sprouts, to which beside Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, which is not known for modesty, is also a word in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring the king of the hearts there.
Although there are respect for the performance of the family, but also the opinion that Trump was "a bit a big mouth" says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname, the Callstadt has in the area, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: The tomb, says it.
Trump comes from the village of the shower.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a local for gold tombs in the USA.
The foundation stone of the real estate company were first land purchases in New York.
But the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to the home in the long run failed at the Bavarian State, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not absorb Trump because he had once relyed without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and People's Cessation, Roland Paul, declared a film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes bustling statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and challenged the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like that, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The retirement winemaker sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so upgrading".
Does he believe that Trump comes?
"I can not imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared for Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions as some Calltaster that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church orgel, which was well received well.
"I can not imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They would find it better if he does not know the choice, because "he has such radical views, I do not know if that's good".
If those who had to say that in the US at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, "if he had never arrived there".
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"My president is not it," she says.
And: "The grapes are also ripe without the President Trump".
Wendels Film, for which Trump was long interviewed, have seen 12,000 cinema singers, even in the US awakens the interest.
The Upper Bavarian community Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineersdorf".
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Weuchpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineers villages".
In the neighboring country, the local Alpine association is responsible for the award of the award.
A "mountaineersdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be shown as a protected area.
The free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
At the beginning of the FW autumn claus in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there is no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to collapse to collapseto preserve, "said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get troubles in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of free voters will be in the lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the free voter meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will overlay the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the nineties.
"That's not how we go, we have to get the causes," said the Free Voter Chef.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylums," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others not."
"We have to be more actionable."
But the state politics in Großwallstadt does not fall under the table.
One years of continuous burner remains on the agenda: the education policy.
Cultural Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the new school year at 47 grammar as a pilot experiment "Intermediate Plus", in which an extension of the high school intermediate level is tested from three to four years - in the result then it takes nine years to high school graduation.
But that does not go far enough Aiwanger.
"The topic G9 must be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want that.
Free ride at the G9 everywhere, where it is desired.

What exactly on the good a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.

The mass makes it: every two years the carmakers on the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, mainly movement is to record the compact cars that are currently very well selling.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: Around 28.1 percent of new registrations, according to Motor Trade Office (KBA), accounted for this segment alone in August.
This also reflects on the IAA (audience days 17 to 27 September).
Many new compact models will be presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars this year.
One of the biggest premiere for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available in the fall with the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
So that the volume model sells well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel provides an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf in view, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offers other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW // 200 hp, to which three-cylinder gasoline tubs are also counting for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only as a five-door.
As a second variant, the station wagon will follow in the spring, which is already on the IAA.
And what is the ASTRA at the IAA still on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane is only seen as a five-door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version.
In the trade he comes beginning next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti is fully adapted to the brand's design line with its curved lines.
The basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp.
The offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbomotor and a capacity of 82 kW / 111 hp.
The maximum torque lies according to the manufacturer's instructions at 170 Newton meters (NM).
Sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.

In the interior, above all, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated Apple's CarPlay for the first time.
Add to this on the IAA in the compact class a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tegel: Five square meter cell are human
The Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel's prison, which was housed for months in a small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells.
This has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to those affected, the judges can hope for money even if they were locked only a few days in the to narrow rooms (Az.: 1 BVR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel-Tegel-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor area;The toilet was spatially not separated.
After that, the man, which,, according to his lawyer now, was back on free foot, has been laid in a larger cell.
His official liability for the land of unprotect conditions against the country Berlin failed.
But the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Chamber Court Berlin and rejected the case for the renewed exam.
They hurt the human dignity of the man.
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if legal reasons from the period in question only a few days of sticking days for the compensation are decisive, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "a steeping of the legal protection of the personality is to be feared".
The Chamber court must now clarify the amount of the damage compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
Thus, in April they spoke to a detainee due to damages because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which had certified a resident in a parallel accident in November 2009 a human resource.
The then plaintiff had been accommodated over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruher Case.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines in recent weeks for missing staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even to brawls it should have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial presses, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied because of junior mangels, 19 will be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"
The immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What comes to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even able to record a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that and we can do that".
What comes to Germany conveys the following overview.
Used according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Tree Ministry) and 400,000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments annually - and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as built before (250000 apartments).
Dramatic is the lack of housing, but especially with affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price binding, and refugees will apply for these particularly favorable apartments.
Federal Tree Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to a billion euros.
Much too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Some scientists and federal treeinister are that there are more tax benefits for investment in housing construction.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labor Market and Professional Research, it can be assumed that in the long term 55 percent of the refugee in Germany can be gainfully employed.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started criticized Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But for the integration of refugees is crucial whether you find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the recording company, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, it has given a political turnaround: from labor ban on refugees to recognize work.
While there used to be a labor ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the perspective also has enforced that refugees should be enabled faster access to the labor market.
A big hurdle for access to the labor market are missing German language skills.
So far, there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
In addition, investigations show that jobs are most commonly conveyed by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore according to Thränhardt the royal road for labor integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children into the Kitas, estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and familyIn the Berlin senate administration.
Nevertheless, to convince the family from the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the need for educators rising greatly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example, by allowing more professionals.
In the countries students are prepared without Germany in welcome classes on the lessons.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, Beate fabric says of the Berlin school administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state forbidden asylum seekers or tolerated studies - the only exception was so far Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has given up his attitude but now.
Studiering refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence allowance or toleration do not receive any benefits under the asylum seeker performance law if they start studying.
The latter basically does not get a BAföG, as they do not fall under the circle of the city's owners.
Heralded refugees had to lived four years in Germany so far in order to be BAföG-authorized, from January 1, 2016 to shorten this range to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, call Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Business.
Students should get BAföG immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law to a new state religion relationship.
Also important would be the founding of an Islamic welfare association, which cares professionally around the newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, Islam's representatives must agree on a clear contact person and willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to tackard religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the worry on Thursday, religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to spend such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to stay here, in Germany," he said in the Bavarian broadcasting.
He suggested translating the basic law in Arabic.
Integration will continue to be much more than today a theme of the whole society.
Thus, the majority company will have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism is pressing urgent.
Although Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a decade of European decisions.
But it is learning very slowly how the NSU murder series showed, systematically ignored the racist motif in the police and authorities.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and the stakeholders do not require non-white German and to undertake international agreements as the Antiracism Convention on Germany, must become a reality in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and to use its new citizens - to use their opportunitiesWell of all.
In general, Germany is capable of providing the expected refugees medically, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man and capacity is concerned, we do that," he said to the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money must flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands to hand over all the arrivals at the registry healthcare cards.
Services rendered could be settled later with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to save as many people with the limited capacity catalog, which the asylum seeker performance law provides for.
Otherwise, the doctors make the language barriers.
Already so far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants become worse about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in medical practices, interpreting costs would need to be taken over.
Help many refugees would also be with more general-medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Under refugee children, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and the teenagers are about HIV enlightenment.
With the sometimes other diseases, German doctors came from their training but clearly says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize".And as far as the lack of concern is concerned, the refugees may even be relieved by the refugees.
The Syrians had a sophisticated education system, several refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take out tests again.
At least half of the refugees incoming in Germany is mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPTK): Most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPTK.
A recently published study of TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee kid arrives traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is ill at a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, cardiac grids and fears of death.
Other symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders, strong frightening and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, an early treatment was necessary, declared Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psychotherapy in social welfare, but the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the Social Offices mostly clerks or physicians who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misalignment, says Munz.

Especially on your Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebro, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the zebroid is not ready for the hanging, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor something should be there.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all my heart."

Accordingly, the moon makes slightly on its train around the ring planet.
This tumble movement is only small, but still too big for a continuous celestial body, it says in a message from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyzes in the "Icarus" sheet.
It was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the South Pole of the Saturnmond in 2006, which spit the water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of the Saturn.
At least on the south pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.

No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But who wants to pay attention to his slim line, is often rather advised against them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits anyway: In them, B-vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. First of all, Mangos contain lots of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Who eats the fruits, thus supports eyesight, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too tight and smelling pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe is the fruit - so green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should store at room temperature and are consumed within a few days.
Then they taste natural pure or sweet food.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.

Rome now has a Martin-Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of Municipal President Ignazio Marino, a hitherto nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now appreciated as a "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Coliseum.
The naming had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over centuries as a minority often could only live in hidden their faith.
With the square, it becomes a symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held himself as a young Augustinermön at the turn of the year 1510/11 for a few months in Rome.
He felt the city at that time as a degenerate scenic.
His negative impressions are likely to hurt him in the opinion of historians in his later fight against Rome.

Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar old painted for his Bible.
Klaus AltePost wrote the introduction and Bible texts updated.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, which has formulated its very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the topics, the quite quite bleak can work.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Cycles are created that devote themselves to topics such as crosshoots, plagues, bids or father unsurers.
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with his theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And above all the author Klaus OldPost, who has dealt on the basis of painting with the respective biblical sites.
He interpreted the Bible locations selected by Otmar Old and so translated into current connections "" translated ".
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the situation here.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant herrhuter-Order.
"The education happened already with the pipe", Otmar remembers old.
"I tried to work up to work with the Herr Father again".
His second concern is to give the art again to more importance in a fastest time: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today, and that is loud.
Symbolism is displaced.
Artists have a different pleasure and bliss to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be in the pictures "fall in", they have to work, discover and feel what force they have: "The picture seeks to be opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "has always been a lover of Otmar Altts's art:" I like how he realizes his pictures ".
Old not respected to fully capture the Bible, but also selected for him, even mysterious issues.
"That was no cooperation at eye level," says ALTEPOST: "This is about the pictures, the text explains only".The origin was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for monuments both the (biblical) language of love as well as the responsibility.
Part of the original paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which is opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.

"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leverkusens Sportschef Rudi Völler said the "Image" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as a "self-evident".
"The refugee drama goes everyone, nobody is allowed to look away."
"We can find football Bundesliga clubs, no, we have to use our radiance, influence and possibilities to help the many refugees, which have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "celebrity sign of the league".
For the EM qualifying match against Hungary This Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale.
Niersbach called the support of refugees as "a great community of German football".
That all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their places, be great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The Embassy "1: 0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"That's of enormous meaning," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," says Niersbach.

Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfelle in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus finally smashed in the first group game of the Europa League.
The international will also be missing the leader of the Football Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 pm / sky).
"We can not resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".

Robotians: Government wants to pioneering for Germany
Germany should be after the will of the Federal Government when changing the car technological pioneer.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobindt (CSU), which offers investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA from a "new mobility age".
The automated and crosslinked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 states, which also meet at the IAA with representatives of the industry.
Among other things, the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a swift change to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
So that the driver "no additional liability risks are recurred", the Federal Government wants to "review and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to use internationally for the maximum permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers of kilometers.
The Federal Government also wants to use for a change in the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as a driver.
When automated driving, the car increases the leadership, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automated driving on highways will be technically possible.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to expect only far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location appreciate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to the more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
The question of liability for accidents and the safety of personal data of the driver must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-propelled cars still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute submitted on Wednesday at the AA testing organization DEKRA comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail in the coming ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 yearsThus, 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect to 2025 with autonomous cars, 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, the motorists in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a survey of the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the road on all roads.
On the highway, the flowing traffic could imagine 15 percent, in the traffic jam 45 percent.
Good every fourth would give the car control under no circumstances.

"Timo was also missing, and we have become European champion."
"That's how we should orient ourselves," explained world ranking fifth.

Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figure-grusel cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: mannequins, which look frightenly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits became the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts.
"I can not say today that I'm the Enfant Terrible the Haute Couture, because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk to the Catwalk" (from the sidewalk on the catwalk), which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation, it is lucky that the fashion creator's initially rejecting attitudehas changed to a show about his person.
Actually, he had been against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It goes to tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hard-to-overview work of the man who has written fashion history without ever training completed.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort was operated: to study the dolls, for example, a stylist was engaged, for example.
14 tons of material have caught the creators according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was still a special delicacies: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He always interested for strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Also Gaultier's old teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, tachy fashionable guards of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he attracted his teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll, his parents did not allow him.
The design of fashion he had taught himself later.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought the then of course.
For his first own fashion show he could not pay the models.
They did not get anything, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as fashion niche
It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around plows to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in a large amount for customers, which, for example, to cover and process curtains.
That alone does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the beginning times of the Plauen Lace, fashion played a bigger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt calls some examples: top in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, form an increasing order potential.
Anyone who serves no niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us you already make half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen is a member of the industry association with nine other companies in the industry association plauener lace and embroidery.
Only you can wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of sales were broken away.
Private specialist shops and the wholesale is almost no longer available.
Our products barely reach the customers in this way.
The masses of the mass are made much cheaper today in Asian room and expelled almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports, currently in Russia and the US.
Sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerated".
Reinhardt complements: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplomesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Estate of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and tips.
In order to oppose the competition from the Asian room something, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
It creates a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which must first think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often varied only slightly to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embraces small beads in some places.
The Plauen Goldsmith Master Bianca Hallebach-Krauße inspired themselves: "Before I could not do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people of the region identify with the topic of Plauen Lace - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a punch.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends should not stir, but Disney dares to a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a new filming, but a kind of continuation, which plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical nanny.
It's about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already fixed: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
EU wants to double a mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers thus enrees a significantly higher dose of the nervoy.
The Consumer Organization Foodwatch, which is a corresponding working paper of the EU, criticized the plans sharp: "Risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and toddlers," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai- or swordfish from "economic policy reasons", are to be raised by a two milligram mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators are already so strongly burdened with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the existing limits.
After doubling the limits, only 14.5 percent would be unusual.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits of other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp are mostly so low, that they already comply with the planned maximum values.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfect distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy-to -xed heavy metal for humans, which greatly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small quantities can be caused especially for unborn damages of the nervous system".
On its homepage, the Federal Environment Ministry is explained in his homepage with regard to the current values, but that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes mainly through coal combustion into the environment.
According to a written information of the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal-fired power plants to the Greens Bundestag members Annalena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury per year, two-thirds of total issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish in Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and nationwide exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, warnings of mercury in fish were already one of the most commonly reported health risks in EU warning system Rasff.
