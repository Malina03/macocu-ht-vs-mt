Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer sought a bit of variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
Chio: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their closing time, they chased in the fast gallop home to the feed troughs.
One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says long.
And that ended up the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - back near horses.
He was leaving his family about the plant of the Alrv, on a horse he did not even sweep himself on photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus the chio.
The reason was quite convincing.
German sports help handed the man from Hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.
There is no lack of awards the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Sheet, Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
Even the British Queen has already sought him.
Longer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sports successes, but also for social commitment".
For decades, a long time has been promoting the offspring.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of the German Sport" on Saturday.
Among the excellent belongs the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giener, the fencer Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wienke, the Jump Rider Alwin SchockemöhleAnd posthum of Handballer Erhard Whimsical.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the lavazza price ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's All About The Money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two US presidential competitors are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
Who, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep the in doubt rather small and warns how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wanted to tax the economy to Tood and regulate death, he says.
He himself would be very different, says Trump.
He will massively return regulations, and it is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money.
Therefore, taxes would increase for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Invested in the Muses, say Trump and Clinton almost word.
The Democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republican.
On Trump, so far-internal discussions could be given.
Significantly, the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and start carbon development in the US again.
Oil funding should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Parisian Climate Protection Agreement he wants to terminate.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energy with their investment program and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.
TPP, the transpacifical trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both want to isolate the US from international trade - but just protect American jobs better.
They should then be better paid, calls for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $ 7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to increase him to $ 15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: Once he says: The minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is to boost growth.
His critics adhere to him, so the budget deficit would only get bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich, is that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Escape: "Every refugee has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life.
If you arrive in Germany, you are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One has put her little son in his arm.
He looks very close to the room with great eyes.
His mother stares at the table top.
Until she realizes that she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
It is a division managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social auxiliary offers in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are fled.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for sole-fled women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich women's aid.
Recently she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
Men do not exist - either as visitor.
The exception is a security guard in front of the door.
"It's not exaggerated to say: Every woman arriving here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten them torture or death or because their families send them as a hope to Europe," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape outweigh: "Many secretly steal them because they see no other way out".
In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honor murder, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
That goes on the flight.
"That tugs demand a sexual plot for a bottle of water, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believe that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany, says Bahr.
Again, single women in refugee accommodations would often be considered inferior to inferior and worst abuse.
This leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the property in the Munich north traumatized, estimates them.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created".
Many women are so familiar with they say nothing.
"Or you do not dare to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too big".
Since they often not knew himself, it only needs more accommodations for them, calls Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they would know about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answers with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in governments.
Even in Swabia alone furnished women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, University and Middle Franconia, there are only partials or own homes in some community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee "Rights of Woman and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also demands that women must be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If the privacy is missing or men and women are housed together, it may - continuous - violence against women come".
Especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be read on the rush, which there is on the house in Munich.
"Since talked about that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Hardly injured - man stands on his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrators cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When this came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the perpetrator.
During the 50-year-old, the clothes destroyed his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
This alerted his sister then.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
She could not move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her life companion.
On the street they arrived the ex-partner of the man.
When the two women relied on the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens say: Investors should be taken into the future much more in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "action concept" to the next Council meeting.
But quarrel is programmed.
First and foremost are the question: who should actually build the favorable apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says, "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban surfaces must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also be built in stock.
However, the great issue in the town hall is so Bratmann: "How do you want investors who want to build on private surfaces?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent at such a space, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social homes as possible."
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should ensure incentives.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible as possible.
The left still wants hardness conditions for investors.
Regardless, so Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we get the professionals.
But the program is not entirely entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you like the loss of another approximately 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will expire over the next few years?
Only by 2020 it will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to the planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding.
That's possible in the Weststadt.
On a blow, the problem could be solved.
Because in the west town run at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the pricing for cheap apartments.
Only: do not want the owners, the housing companies.
For the number of social housing in theest city is increased dramatically again, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city should not exist anymore.
The green expect that there will be movement in the discussion.
Faction Chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must go into the boat."
Although they have focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But what does not mean that it can not be found yet a compromise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new football season on Sunday at the first step.
The Catalans occur in the duel around the Spanish supercup away against the FC Seville, the second leg rises three days later at Camp Nou.
Doubleginner must refrain from others on Neymar in the forefront of the inferior customs and ruling Europa League Champion, which denies Brazil the Olympic Soccer Tournament.

Seville, in turn, to digest the 2-3 defeat after renewal in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is eleven with hitherto eleven the record winner in this competition.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12.5.4.4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided finale.
Thus, the World Ranking List-first took the "Golden Grand Slam" with WM, World Cup, World Tour Finding tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.

It was clear that for the third time a Chinese would bring the individual title in the sign of the five rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-LED Legionnaire Ryu Seung-Min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to the plate alone, between the sentences and Time outs they had no coaches.
They had withdrawn on the grandstand and left their proteins in the fair competition alone on each other.
"The matches to here I played for my country."
"In the final I play for me," Zhang had said consequently.
After the gameposedgold and silvermedal winnerwith theChineseflag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really fight with his 28-year-old opponent in the first sentence.
Then he certainly determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of MA not the expected rousing match developed.
But nonetheless were sufficiently stunning ball change.
Mizutani won the game around Bronze against the 40-year Vladimir Samsonow 4: 1.

Incidentally, Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become a similarly high table tennis age Olympia fourth.
Donald Trump admits "tremendous problems" in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive ensuring, including in traditionally conservative states their majority.
Presidential Candidate Donald Trump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-lane and self-reliable multimillionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals within the own republican camp out of the race, the doubts are now growing on his success in the fight for the white house.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," said Trump from Evangelical Christians, which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilt should be false reports about his candidacy, he received his well-known media scarce again.
Republican strokes wobble
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey of Surveyusa from June, Trump and his competitor were equal to the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Although other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that are common for Republican candidates in the state.
The endangered also apply Arizona and Georgia.
In an interview of the station CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wants to stop the advance of Clintons again: "Just as I have made it so far".
And pushed behind: this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He makes nothing else than "to tell the truth".
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's alright, said Trump.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party should have threatened Trump to delete funds to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress want to achieve more under their arms.
Olympia: Dreiest Fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes threatens to the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Unspeich.
After a fraud attempt with a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced, immediately to set up a disciplinary commission in order to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Zahrah, in the Olympic Village had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The World Association IAAF has asked the IOC to provide information about the case to make its own investigations issued an IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Grah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent as a Ferguson Rotich, the sample released and signed," said Kenya's Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been deducted from Rio games.
He should have informed against cash payments athlete of his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi.
Kenya stands for a long time at the IOC for many doping offenses for a long time under special observation.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls from the IOC, more than 2000 doping target checks before RIO games, it was unusably noteworthy that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are visible.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had made a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, creating an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympic Start.
As a result, Wada Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping combat are compliant with the rules of Wada.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, allegations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of the sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last demanded a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired her in Russian athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport has been doped nationwide and systematically.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festspiele present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic loving couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With there a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquered Salzburg: The "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of the Mary.
In the orchestra trench the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this staging, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with sadness to her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of the Maria has always fascinated me.
First, because she is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, i feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is wise, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a monster generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that's very important at all!
For the American director Philip WM. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "This piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertoors went to New York, and the New York inhabitants did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as well as then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community Germany expects ten thousands of protective seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", the association chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Because of the hard action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany expects mass escapes to Germany.
"At short notice, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strokes with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the thwarted coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can not be that a state that owns refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The bond defended the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
So that Wool Erdogan increase the distance pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or distributed over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The association chief demanded that the Federal Government "as sharp as Austria is positioning against Erdogan and his followers".
Also in Germany, a "witch hunt" is held against Erdogan critics.
I do not feel safe for the first time in the last few months in Germany.
The German branch of Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will search asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionelle.
The fire label as a Gülen-Pendant destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculares," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on vocational numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum authorizers recognized for political persecution in Germany in front of the coup.
As of the reporting date of June 30, this had been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-owned (39,625).
In this survey, they do not find themselves that fled before war, poverty or perspectivelessness.
Understanding asylum according to the Basic Law are only political, so by state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
You have understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In 2021, the state election will not take place again directly at the end of summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided beginning of the year.
Because stupid as so far is not: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites.
The locals who are to be convinced of the electoral fighters are on vacation.
The vastirists who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the road, are not locals, so can not choose the state parliament.
There are also practical problems: during the holidays are helper, which hang up posters, inflect air balloons, spread flyers and count out voices, only troublesome.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has once even elected election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, strongest party since 1998, is clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting, how strongly neutral AfD cuts out and what is left at the end of coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can see from its large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and looks at a little bit with the people, as well as his legendary word cargo predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel blaming the blossom of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "we create that" has accelerated the rise of the right populists, which probably will probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced as it is when you make the right place at the wrong time.
She invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to biggests;Merkel Bundestag election circle is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," lamented Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it's a pity of anyone from other corners of Germany to listen once Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign levels on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That says Kokert, play only a "subordinate role".
Also, the Union has noticed that in the country, her base bolts away that she has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely available in the vastness of the country.
The Council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his colleagues is also self-releasing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffest, golden weddings, every birthday party needs to be used".
Because a lot is on the game, Sellering now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were recently 22 percent behind Partner CDU (25) and just just before the AFD (19).
In the election of 2011, the SPD was still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should create the leap in the state parliament.
They make a modern virtue from the holidays and embarrass their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it calls the state chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters go on track search for domestic voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curved straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and find it nice.
Your impression: "Wanned holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty".
B27 renovation: restaurants suffering from blocking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.
For the responsible persons of the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and ending only at 20 o'clock, there are allenthen praise.
"They made everything rather poached," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.
That's a super team.
There is no delay.
The construction site was able to be relocated south at the beginning of the week at the half-time south, until the end of October everything should be ready.
The concession of the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of handling rides.
Since the construction site has hiked south on Monday and the blocking of the AsperStraße in Ofterdingen was repealed and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 back on both sides.
The avoidance traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says the Deputy Chief Chief Facture of Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weihererrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichwegen sought themselves and more familiar to their navi than the signs.
What led to some trucks in residential areas.
Since the speed limits have not been adhered to, the community demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable overruns," says King, who made sure of the situation on the spot.
Since two to three per minute have been flashed.
The fastest was on the road with 77 hour kilometers in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site is continued, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people can not look into the maps.
But that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to your sales burglaries, everyone who asks you ask.
However, some more and some are less affected.
Who has less to do with the "end customer", so produced for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly follow.
Even at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "at most slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running customer is missing".
The most advised are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
That's existence threatening.
Not only him, but all restaurants have "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be glad about every euro sales.
He evaluates the loss of sales to "well over 50 percent".
The road renovation has "thrown back at two years".
Half of his employees he had to be released.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt has on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, answered by the appeal, otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now they must also have the disadvantages that are through theRenovation yield.
Göhner knows from other counties where such a more generous was handled.
For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
After all, family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now looking for the complicated traffic routing.
If you can not drive up, it's nice somewhere else.
That his regular clientel returns after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhler holds the impact of B 27 construction work on his clientele for the largest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in their many years of history.
Six months construction works, that's already brutal.
Constantly screwed to laws on behalf of terrorist control.
Foreign Minister De Maizière now presents a big security package according to the latest attacks.
But what has to do a dulding status with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner, says the Federal Interior Minister at the presentation of his new security package.
You do not overgrow anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate about that.
But as the Minister of the Interior, he was located at results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has made a little time after the recent stops in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for safety in the republic.
But these are now all the more extensive.
Some is already known, proclaimed, piled: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
Partly part of the Maizière starts a second attempt for suggestions that have not been to be made with the SPD: he wants sympathy advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double citizenship buttons the German passport.
"That will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still hold this for reasonable and demand nothing, which has no opportunities at the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas also presented De Maizière.
They have partially in themselves: he plans fast methods for deportations and more options for imprisoning people before deportation.
Refugees, which are targeted in the country, should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the event of defulings for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who purposes criminal offenses or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of them is politically and legally tricky.
Some effects also actually acts and makes questions open.
And for some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: What has it actually with security and terror to do?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.
But it can not be credited that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about the safety in view of the high refugee numbers.
And things that people were deeply employed, could not exclude themselves in campaign times.
The inner safety is enormously moved into the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election struggles.
Union and SPD therefore increasingly focus on the topic of internal security.
Over the past few days, it was high between the two parties.
Only a sustainable dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security-policy ideas collection of some Union ministers, in which the department chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a departure from double citizenship.
De Maizière also struggles here for conciliatory sounds.
From a departure from the double pass he does not hold anything.
We satisfied the discussion in Germany.
They do not make sense.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, must only show.
It puts a lot in it, which could provide dispute.
But the SPD is currently trying to profilify at the topic of internal security.
Party feet Sigmar Gabriel signals first time to talk and say, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still slipping by.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not in all markets it runs round.
At the recall, there is a stylish for a concept.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of subordinate in the second half of the year.
In Europe's largest car maker, in the previous year, despite the dieselaffanking thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets further a plus.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened especially in Western Europe and thus burdened the overall sale, as the company noted in the DAX announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, according to China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.
In the home market of Germany, the deliveries were sagging about almost a sixth.
Brand distribution leader Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July, especially on two sales days less back in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there have been a purchase retention by "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote was also burdened at the exit from the EU, explained a spokeswoman.
In the US, where the exhaust affair escalated first, a minus is also a minus.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main brand of the Lower Saxony is continued by the diesels scandal anyway: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales leader Fred Kappler continued to show a sales plus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust tests.
Alone in Germany, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles there are no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car maker stops a "warrantile" certificate after retrofitting, but do not speak of a "warranty", as it was on Friday in corporate circles.
Reason are legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported, Volkswagen grant his German customers now a guarantee for surrounded diesel models.
These have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
From the Ministry of Transportation was confirmed that this meeting gave.
"VW has fully fulfilled the conditions of my inquiry commission and the KBA."
"Deviations of this will not be accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the warranty that no deterioration takes place in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
In the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers come into a workshop, for example, for half a year after conversion - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also in the customer interest, it is important to avoid that there is any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal to uncertain about possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers in future penal interests - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's all about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or days money accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees a signal in it: normal savers would not have to "do not fear to pay for their savings gross penalty".
Store banks of money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), you must pay your 0.4 percent penalty.
Raiffeisenbank GMUND refines this fee from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on giro or overnight money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future will be 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He hats 40 million euros for quite some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use.
"They lie with me on the central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank boss.
"I can not lie down for every million 4000 euros."
The costs he now forwards after the polluter pays principles.
Easy to leave the cash in the tresors of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I do not want the fifth!", Said the bank board.
Most customers have understanding and changed to other investment forms.
Only a few emigrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria explained: "The extreme monetary policy price of the ECB causes significant costs for all banks".
To wear them alone, be "permanently permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penal interest for deposits from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with her skat bank branch 2014.
Michael Kemmer, headcurs of the banking association, said, "We do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong among banks and savings banks."
A banker said at Tegernsee give it "a clientele, which is a bit lush by the fortune".
"That can be for a small bank to become a problem," if you have money for free.
The Cooperative Bank Gmund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Actors, athletes and entrepreneurs known in the region of living.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "are currently no known banks that calculate a statute replacement for deposits of private clients," said spokesman seriously.
The President of the Federal Association of the German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Happy, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold, go to the negative to the private customer, is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it turns the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not be liked that in the width.

Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's Raser must set the next generation speedometer: in different federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are tested, which are to be carried out particularly effectively.
For example, the futuristic enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used to accident focuses, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on motorway construction sites or recovering bridges with temporary speedimit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary speed camera for compliance with speed limit.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: His battery holds five days for continuous measuring mode, the case data is encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded over several traces at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans after the time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the upturn state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.
So that he is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also disappear shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the speed camera from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested in various federal states according to VITRONIC and now also used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technique: Yearly France has requested 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the water purifement association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "Bayern-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water purpose association as a role model for the big water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution of Bayerischer Rundfunk.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group applies "Bayern-wide as an exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zwerkverband employees, of which 28 years of them as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65 years.
The Veitenstein Group's drinking water purpose association, located in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the communities of Kirchlautler, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water delivery contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set in 1985 as a water treatment and has been appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they extended water pipe construction and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, the budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.

There had been no standstill and have been recaptured again and again because water life meant and drink water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used himself with a lot of passion for his water purifement and has lived the water purifement law as if it were his own company.

He has received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water and he was a loyal scarce.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As the highlights from his point of view, he described the fountain building and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult mission, however, were the pipe break on the high tank at churchflower at a January 3rd.
Here he had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn one could once only be able to maintain because you filled the high tank of petties with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from louder, which starts succession of Rupert Göller.

Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-bonded and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared millions of millions.
Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity promotion are from the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge for the existing plants for so-called self-flow production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad that we finally reached that after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore planned first to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said the WAZ, now there is a fundamental treatment with the EU Commission for talks with competition commissarin Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in steelworks, an EEG surcharge of 20 percent fail.
But even these are not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission for electricity generation.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely committed.
Of particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Even with the reform of the emissions rights trade, climate and employment goals are to be weighed," said IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to strengthen as the world's largest producer country China threw the world market in the face of the weakest domestic demand.
European manufacturers cast pricing Chinese steel corporations price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel effect, on the other, the economic prospects have brightened in China.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime of ThyssenKrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Most recently, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Lastly, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the same month last year, as the economic association of steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the crafted crowd now went back the second month in succession.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's level.
The association expects an improved discharge in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
Singing, Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching studies she took the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.
Incidentally, she is doing something good for her health and mind.
For singing is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.
Most seniors sing in choir and share with like-minded people's joy of music, describes Hackler.
Due to the regular summation, seniors can make and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be attracted and organized, to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of joining".
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.
Who calls for his lungs regularly, does not get out of the puff in everyday life.
Even when it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice in old age, sing an optimal hobby.
Older people often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the federal labor community of the senior organizations.
In older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in the free time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in elderly people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and particularly melodies, even dementia patients are removed in long past events.
When singing, the head also requires special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice so not only focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences by singing in the choir means Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through the singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I'll be better and waxes about me - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing is enough.
Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent, advises Lenz.
You do not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears there, when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different ways, says Hackler.
If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, you can easily connect.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the community or church leadership.
Many senior choirs can be found over the internet.
Who has no access to the Internet, can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.
Who feels like to sing, should definitely connect a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that is for every age.
Cats react sensitive as a hangover on cries of the young
Biologists have studied in Hanover, which effect the call of cat babies on adult animals has.
To her surprise, the male did not leave the males cold - but they always behave in the difference to the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitation of katzenbabys on the mains of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to loud of kittens who have been in great need, as scientists have found out of the veterinary university and the Hannover Medical University (MHH).
Cat also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the mowls of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not perceptible or not important," said the Biologin Wiebke Konerding of the mhh.
It is a first staff of the study, which was published on this Friday in the expert magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten screams distinguished with the urgency of their need for help.
Overall, nine adults were observed and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the mhh.
For a call for only three minutes, they were played out of the throwbox and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger-excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results despite the small sample for meaningful.
"All females, even those who had not had their own offspring, responded differentiated to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this calls of the very exciting kittens played.
This ability may be innate or developed with the sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied several times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby noise.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the Biologin Marina Scheumann.
Podolski attacks "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan sweep is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been adopted against the former football star Hakan Hakan.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya is the official line clearly: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even in the imposition of the state of exception after the overrun attempt in July, the government assumed that everyday life should not be affected by normal citizens.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of listening to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is responsible for the coup attempt.
It does not stop even before football.
The public prosecutor's office expressed an arrest warrant against the former Hakan Hakan.
Accordingly, the south of America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Süßühr shall be a follower of the Prediger Fethullah Gülen, which is made responsible by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the initial state imposed for 90 days is valid until October, actually the life of most Turks but as good as no effect.
The nocturnal "Democracy Guard" on public squares throughout the country explained Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - split in trailers and opponents Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas traditionally does not count to the friends of the president.
What the groos of the Turks, but in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military scrapers.
Even even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Cup winner "Gala" it will be particularly back on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne's athletic value demonstrated in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playing time as Topscorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1: 0 victory goal.
The newspaper "Fanatics" cheered him: "He was the best in the square."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a reconcilient degree for the record champion.
After the preliminary round k.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also separated in the Europa League early.
In the Süper Lig it was enough only to rank six.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who put the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonals as Süper-Lig Goal Scenes.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez under contract and at Besiktas only borrowed at AC Florence had announced after the coup attempt, not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say," Quaid the trade magazine "Kicker" Club Chef Fikret Orman.
But the striker would have to be ready to renounce around one third of his annual salary estimated to 7.5 million euros, Emman clearly said: "We can not pay his salary in Florence".

A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, assaulted Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the world's fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (hammer's throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete, so many medals were subsequently witnessed.
So Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later, after testosterone doping was detected.
The now 40-year-old also had to leave Olympia-Silver 2004 because of steroid doping and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
The abandoned bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was received by a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80.04 m, he ranked two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km go, China): The world recorder and goldfavorite was first tested positively in May, but still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence has been found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement, the lock of the World Anti-Doping Agency Wada fell from Mild and ran on the 13th of July.
BombmentError in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday Freb.
She has suffered cutting wounds and was treated in the hospital, but could already leave this again.
Your journey home was planned for early September.
Whether by the other explosions on the tourist island Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang NGA, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens, is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.
Located in about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin had initially exploded on Thursday evening in a branch quarter of two bombs.
According to police, a Thai native were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three German, three Dutch and three Italians.
Fridaybreaking, two explosives again went up, another person was killed according to the authorities.
Also from Phuket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion.
At the detonation near the vacationer bathing beach Patong was injured after police, a taxi driver was injured.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed an urban employee.
The explosive set was loud the authorities in a flowerbed in front of the area of the coastal police in the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang NGA and tranned the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast several injured.
One go out from a connection with the explosions in Hua, it said.
"The bombing taters carry the same handwriting," said Armee General Danai Kritmethavee Friday's Frühfrüh in Journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express themselves to possible motifs - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks, which is typical of the bombs of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited territories and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, they assume that the bombs were placed by opponents of the prevailing military junta.
The authorities would have received intelletized information in the past few days on imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and the places.
Be unclear which group behind the stops.
The police pointed out their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they usually do not stand against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over years of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
According to the high-bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommended on his homepage to ensure the instructions of Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preh Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim population parts, these provinces are advised against unnecessary travel.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution developed by the military junta.
This clears the military influence also in the coming years.
Junta boss and prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha said the bombs had been an attempt to pie chaos, while the country moves towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had taken power after a phase of bloody riots, keeps himself benefit herself, the kingdom again led to stability and order.
However, it has not succeeded in the military to get the uprising of Muslim rebels smoldering for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were also killed in Bangkok at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.
The rights "identity movement" is in the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection.
After several substitutes, the Constitutionists in the federal government have placed the group under observation.
"We see indications of aspirations against the liberal democratic basic as the 'Identity Movement'," said Constitutional Protection Chef Hans-Georg Maeas of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused extremistically.
That's why we watch the movement now too.
The "identity movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
She turns against "Multikulti delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity by surprising".
Constitutionists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "identities" already.
Maaßen said his authority had voted closely with the regional offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identity Movement' try to pick up your target group where it stands," said the Constitution Protection Chef.
Generally, extremists try to address them with adolescent language, often with Poppiger music.
The affairs of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not an impressive advertisement for your own thing.
The propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly prone to.
This is dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports of the "identity" to AFD politicians from several federal states.
Maaßen said, he did not have any insights.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from some point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AFD - by certain persons who are extremist, changes their targeting direction and is so extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such people have controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
With a view to the significant increase in legal motivated offenses and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodations, Maaßen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.
It can well be that further legal terrorist groups or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks plan from other right-wing extremist motifs.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Worried, Maeseßen expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who have not appeared in the right scene beforehand.
That's the worrying.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated offenders or followers of the right scene.
"Many people have made criminal offenses that had previously had nothing to hat with right-wing extremists who may have chosen politically indifferent or, for example, CDU, SPD or LINKE, which then radicalized by right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros became internetity
Not always the Olymposics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatic's Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was no longer visible in the TV images at times.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In the social networks was then used to viral internetity.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends his lead with a residue of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was more of his not very sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media.
Why the 24-year-old nevertheless participates in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries acquainted.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros has done for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media designated him as "Robel of Wal".
Based on a "wealth belly", the English boulevard sheet "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he slammed only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter there.
Comparisons with "Eric The Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer was unforgettable from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a lead over 100 meters of freestyle.
Frenetically Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned only eight months before Olympia swimming and had never completed a distance before the competition.
Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been rigorously.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left their business on Monday at 5:30 pm and forget to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 pm, the cash register had disappeared about 250 euros.
Traces of the offender could not be found.
A video surveillance is not available.
Trump does not look so tight the threatening electoral defeat
The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump talks about a campaign event in Florida.
Should it be nothing with the election to the US President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He then go on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, he would not matter to him, "ultimately it will either work, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," said the Candidate of the Republicans in a telephone interview with the USTV channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, said Trump.
Thus, he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as a founder of the terroristiliz Islamic State (IS).
Within its party, last and more resistance formed.
Post rises in trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest from other companies at the vehicle is obviously great.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle Streetscooter too.
In the near future, the Group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer your electric transporters on the free car market from the coming year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has been checking whether she should also sell its own developed Streetscooter, with the letters and parcels, also to sell to other companies.
Post Officer Jürgen Gerdes had said it always ask it, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the message magazine "The Mirror", the Bonn Group will soon enter the mass production of vehicles.
In the mailing factory, the company plan the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and line a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet.
The Streetscooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GRP leadership occurs after disappointing business numbers
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The returns suddenly came - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK was guessed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After re-disappointing business numbers and the resignation of corporate governance, the world's five of the industry is a new beginning of a personnel new beginning.
GRP board boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GRP Supervisory Board Arno Mälter already leaves the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The leadership in the Executive Board will take on the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company announced.
He should officially take over the function of a "Board of Directors" until a successor to Hartmann was found.
As the reason for the returns, the company called "different views" for the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to call a corporate spokesman on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future, is currently unclear.
In investors, it was on Friday, the shareholders were least the disappointment on the remaining successes of the restructuring years ago had been great.
Mr. Hartmann has been on the GRP top since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that was the case with BMW, that would make the Quandts so," it said.
According to setbacks in the previous quarters, the company could not stop his loss ride in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Relative to the first half of the year, sales at € 721.2 million shrank by 3.4 percent.
Especially the lower value of the company has burdened the profit in the second quarter in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company recruitments of 139 million euros necessary in the Consumer Experience division brought a loss of 148.2 million euros under the bottom line.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had also generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in ditch: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to dodge their information to a recovery vice that drove partly on the opposite link.
The bus came to the right of the street and slipped into a ditch as a spokeswoman of the police Aurich / Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an emergency car came to the accident site on the state road 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought from a bus back to the Krummhörner district Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators demanded the loader and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of wastewater plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros instead of so far;For Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an over-circular calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
Like Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Landratsambach Kulmbach found that, for these wastewater treatment plants, undercenses incurred.
The Casendorf market was obliged to operate the facilities with legal fundamentals.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg must be deeper in the purses.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also supervision from the previous calculation period.
The serious fee increases justified Schmidt so that all three wastewater systems are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater treatment, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious.
In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period for all three plants, not least due to their age resurrection and repair expenses were incurred in a significant extent.
The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation plant had to be exchanged in the wastewater system Azendorf due to a damage.
In the Pumpwerk Welschenschahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor plants had to be overtaken from the ground up and in the pond-walancing system Lopp had to be deducted after almost 20 years of operation, the first clearance of the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option is installed in order to be able to comply with the water law specifications in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses came from the updated care and maintenance costs that are considered in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly under the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that the low wastewater attack in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance "Fully knock out".
It was, supplemented Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs in the wastewater systems has been spared in the past 20 years.
The situation for the systems mentioned will continue to remain pre-prekair in the long term in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Wastewater Teck Association Friesenbachtal could not expand these facilities because it is deficit institutions.
At bomb attack killed: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life to the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmet", a civil protection group, which, according to the picture newspaper so far, saved almost 60,000 people's life.
2900 volunteers rely on their own life to draw people from bombed houses and to make first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector, which shows him with a 11-hour salvation of an infant from the rubble of a house, went to the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian to the glowing symbol figure in the gray of the war.
As hero he never saw himself, said loud picture: "For me, that's the real Jihad."
"If I die from saving life, I think that God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim himself, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing in Syria.
The helicopters have dropped four barrels of bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with Chlorasas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We now eliminate the poisonous remains of the bomb, so that not children play with it," quotes the picture his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenlandhia usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenlandhie get only 150 years of offspring.
The Greenlandhai swims down at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, he comes on average just 1,220 meters wide.
Only when it matters, the five-meter long animal accelerates on a whopping 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a robbe with this maximum speed.
But this lifestyle embossed by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the trade magazine "Science" at any rate of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
"Madness" commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock This lifespan that means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenlandhie becomes stone.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to watch, finally they live above all in the Earme in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
About the lifestyle of Greenlandhie, researchers know less.
Her slow-motion ppo measured them as they equipped six animals with a station with a broadcaster.
Booty make these sharks anyway: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
You may chase sleeping animals or patrolling on the ground of the Earmeer and are looking for cadavers that are scattered down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenlandhai, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen brought bytang from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter measure.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon 14 method the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon 14 in the lens nucleus.
Her birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons experiments hurled larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lens core contained a low excess of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated his 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.
All major groutland sharks had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens core, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 o'clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai, while the record shark may be 392 years old at 502 centimeters.
That Greenlandhai females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.
Now the researchers of the length could assign an old age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably determined at the threshold to the sexual maturity and his age at the age of 156, Greenlandhaie with the proliferation obviously at least one and a half centuries can be time.
That too is likely to be world record for vertebrates.
That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures often also runs the organism of the animals living there on austerity flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal is more dangerous and should focus on having as far as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest his resources rather in a long life.
Building in the double pack
With topics related to building, the municipal council has focused on the recent meeting.
With relief, the committee took the message of Mayor Robert Putz on that "finally the marketing of the recently proven residential planes can begin".
After the property, parceling and development questions clarified and the applications could be made for surveying, the sale of the land in the residential buildings "Straslweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - expansion section 1) on interested parties is nothing in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building surfaces in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau appeal to young families and spray seniors alike.
As it was said, builders can now report in the town hall, the assignment of the parcels the municipal council is expected to advise in his September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with inquiries on the establishment of other commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the area use plan in sub-areas newly created in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area under time, the commercial area already proven there is extended by two plots towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs relocated from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field Financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether cash houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU pass, the approval in the United Kingdom is sufficient.
That's just great US banks.
Several banks have already announced to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone unites, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Supervisory Authority and the Risk Association ESRB.
In Paris, the organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD) is headquartered, but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is a large fund industry, as well as Dublin in the infrastructure, cut off worse.
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the large airport.
Further, the city with easily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the his are also the rents for first-class commercial real estate by 50 percent higher than am Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a greater quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's business consultancy, the city is in place in Seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of the preferences: "With his already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," concludes the IW.
London, however, will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit-Votum, mean the economic researchers.
The power relations also speak: In London, the Landesbank Helaba worked around 144,000 people in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt was 62500.
City Council decides unanimously: no kiosknaus on St. Goarer Rhine
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of traders will accept with kiss hand - the retail trade in the core city is considered significantly expandable.
The City Council rejected the application for the new construction of a sales cabin on the Rhine buffer in the immediate vicinity of Rheinbalkon's under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit down," said Michael Hubath for the CDU faction.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of REWE XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the ruling of a firearm demanded three darkly dressed persons who had hummed their faces, from the employee of the beverage market the publication of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was caught, the police do not join.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters high, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible from the parking deck of the REWE market accessible and poorly visible.
The perpetrators must be ran after the raid towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and be fled by the gravel parking space located opposite the car park entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations at the time of the paper (at 19.45), which are in connection with the robbery, should be urgently reported to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer leisure time
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and adolescents of the social educational day group / social group work of the Children's Protection Council of Nagold with their caregivers on their summer-free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwälldle was the lifelong group was quartered during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celten Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, who invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinary children and supervisors were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the acidic spaetzle, the Seebronner Panquet, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, there was pearled, beautiful pieces of pearls and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on the fire and the final "colorful evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and adolescents were happy home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrim hike from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to bridge the time to the next romance ride of all ministrants, the Oberministräntenrunden St. Anna has decided to prepare and execute a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided for the Bishopsadt Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the holy year of mercy, a special pilgrimage target was offered on the occasion of the mercy at the Freiburg Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmer made their way up.
On the evening before Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrimage.
From Horb, a train was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster of our dear woman is standing and so the pilgrim journey was started by the Münster.
The individual day trips were framed in the morning and in the evening of a short pulse with different prayers, songs and font texts.
But even on the road, the minis of field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly ratted to sing together a song from specially put together pilgrims songbook.
For the nights, parishes of local parishes were available.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made for a tasty and stronger dinner and breakfast.
It went on the second day about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day you started the stage to St. Peter, which was the onset of paths, while sulky heat, had to descend around 500 vertical meters and then climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the evening in the evening.
After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly facilitated and happily hit the mini afternoon at the Freiburg Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
God was thanked with a small impulse.
In the evening fair in the Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrim destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the Hochaltar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgebaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went by train back to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey from country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18th), significant losses for government parties SPD and CDU are distinguished.
These revealed representative surveys of the opinion research institute InsA for the "image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule further in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party thus only narrowly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AFD.
The left would at 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AFD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the state parliament.
The green cows in spite of slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) back in the Schwerin Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament, each with 3 percent.
At the Berlin House of Representatives, the SPD of the survey would only be at 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AFD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates, on the other hand, would miss in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in my hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty chunky.
The built-in memory at the beginning was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would range today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair CeBIT in Hannover as the "office in the west pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator to achieve.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, though tormenting slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen found.
Pretty proud the price was: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
Nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything is different.
The wise phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.
The cell phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and unwound on Microsoft.
Master the market today providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere be online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Sold about 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple accounted for 555 million pieces alone.
Global sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
There are also the well-running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone has now created a whole industry.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator to easily operate everything via touch screen.
The victory train from Apple began, today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market had the look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
That's what Apple and Asian providers like Samsung have now.
The smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years under his invention.
On average, every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away again," said Janina's ball, in the Siemens Board responsible for staff.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
A controversial baseball star occurs
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days of Base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old professional will bear the jersey of his New York Yankees against Tampa Bay Rays on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-color all-star game participant of the Major League baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen to the most valuable player of the league, 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has spent $ 27 million each year since 2007.
By the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he managed some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie May's only two other baseball players in the most important statistics have similar values.
But in the glory hall of baseball, the 41-year-old should not be recorded.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the Superstar gave to "ESPN" to have banned steroids banned between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was blocked due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014 for 211 lots.
Rodriguez is considered a major suspect, for years about an anti-aging clinic in South Florida performance-promoting funds.
After a legal dispute, the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league could even have done a favor for the year 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at that time Süffisant.
His farewell days did not go noiseless.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez had to sit frequently on the bench.
"My job does not include farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," etched Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and be said to the situation with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, sympathy expressions of the fans of Yankee-Errival Boston Red Sox.
"We Want A-Rod", sang the followers at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping sample, Weightgle Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio may not start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically critical athletics competitions, these messages come to the timer.
At Chen, the Diuretics Hydrochlorothiazide had been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed local time on Friday afternoon local time from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminary runs over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has applied for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association take the matter "very seriously and requires Chen full cooperation with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a message: "We will work with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases is no longer responsible.
Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample was by Danekova, the 33-year-old went into the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," explained the athletist.
According to the report, the banned substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov reported immediately with criticism of the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded".
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was known, the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days before tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.
Both deny ingestion, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the case Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF was forbidden to the complete Russian team except for systematic doping, even the runners of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the former offenses in China had also taken care of for heavy conflicts between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsch.
"Sun Yang pinks purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to pass myself," Lacourt said in the French radio.
SUN was also the focus of an examination of the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun was positively tested in 2014 at the Chinese championships on the stimulant trimetazidine, but only had to settle a three-month barrier.
Data Clause: So perfide compact hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently giving targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes multiple victims of an oppressor software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aim of a ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the segregates required by the perpetrators to use the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their blackmaster software, according to the observations of malwarebytes, more and more on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially reaching ransom is significantly higher than private users.
"We are currently watching a frightening rapid evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski talking to the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.
First private users were the goal, but the change towards corporate attacks took place in recent months frightening quickly.
Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is targeted for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives and videos archives and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.
In order to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of crypto currency bitcoin.
But where private users stands for the personal photo database at the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without resting production.
Accordingly, the damage falls higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business activity, in one case were people in mortal danger.
In Germany, several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute due to the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: Does not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the light of standstill during operation.
The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have studied the user interfaces and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
You declare your victims by chat as you can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for example example files.
And will resolve private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate sometimes hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
It is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.
The former malware kits were created by bought the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000.
"Included in the scope of delivery is a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So logged into one of the forums in the substrate, the set buys from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is carried out per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful enhancement, the perpetrators instead threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the damage potential depending on the type of data is still many times higher than before.
Also, the perpetrators could in future take completely new goals on the Internet of things on the grain.
On the Hacker Conference Defcon demonstrated security researcher, as you could get a thermostat associated with the Internet under its control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could certainly be worth a ransom value.
If the offenders then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overcharged, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not look closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and act pleasant, only the cockpit top falls there.
Versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.
It is not only a trunk of 453 l at highly exposed and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like cinema armchair, providing storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the bottom to the ceilings.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 nm in width speed areas.
He should do his job a bit quieter.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.
There is another motorization: a 1,5-L gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a bit more direkter.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top version "Executive" tested.
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (operates to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects".
Very reliable, the high-voltage assistant works.
And the intelligent temporal reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.
The full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome.
The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, get the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The motors meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable for dangers that are typical of aviation argued the Higher Regional Court Dusseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have passed everywhere - it is a general risk of life, so the court.
The airline did not have to pay damages to the man.
Disease: when the organizer pays
Old vacationers only get money after their journey, if the cause of the disease can be found doubt in the hotel.
But that's the case only if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was difficult for diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the tourists to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly dirty the seawater.
The family was the view that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the applicants had no success.
Although the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer learned shortly before departure of the plaintiffs.
He had to assume that the seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belonged to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests were only 38 suffered.
De Maizière said, according to the violence of violence in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would have to worry about further attacks.
The state must be prudent and determined at the same time react to terrorism.
Sure is: Our country will not answer the violence of the offenders with hate and cleavage.
We will not treat this triumph to the terrorists.
If offenders would have to leave the country faster, but the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2007 general election.
He also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces, "in a medium four-digit magnitude over several years".
Sympathic advertising for terrorism must be punishable again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, the right to weapons are amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently discussed confidentiality for doctors should be maintained according to De Maizières words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions, as the endangerment of citizens could be reduced, he said, about mental abnormalities.
In order to counteract a radicalization of refugees, the minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers would have to be better prepared for the handling of traumatized people.
For tracking criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), De Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD boss Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything, which helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of Interior clearly pronounced actionism.
"That was an eartief for sharpener in the CDU / CSU," said Gabriel the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka prohibition and abolition of dual nationality.
A general prohibition of full clamping is a matter of constitutionally problematic.
You can not prohibit everything you reject, and I reject the wearing of the Burka.
You can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green boss Simone Peter threw the minister to simulate energy and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left party feet Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a tightening of residence law do not bring people in this country to safety".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly stows on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But that should change: the right toll should be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are in traffic at the ambient road every night at the traffic jam when they drive through the motorway feeder (A 43).
The state-owned road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße the right of law at 700 meters.
Car drivers can then threach directly from the hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic is divided at the earlier, which improves the overall run on the busy section of the main road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The road narrowing on the feeder annoys the motorists especially between 5 and 7 pm.
On the working day, the backwater reaches the bridge over the Albersloher away and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steered on the motorway bridge.
The second lane had to be rebuilt in front of every night of a quarter.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to absorb the heavy duty traffic.
How long this bottleneck and the associated works daytime traffic is lasting, the responsible country can not say.
However, at years is expected: because the bridge has an official residual life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right of laws, the state company deliberately chose the traffic weaker time in school holidays, because with disabilities be expected.
The traffic is led past on Tuesday and Wednesday a lane at the construction site.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The club Nima's and the young theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class international" of the forest school Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "the invisible house" of the young theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students visited between eleven and 15 years the staging in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, to the goal of welcoming schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster and talked little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, it was possible to follow the crushing course nevertheless, according to the press release of the young theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. med.Tannaz Westerberg from Scrapel, and the young theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without an escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, spectacle and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of play and theatrical language education are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the club expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the Southwest Southwest in the southwest of Germany on the night of Friday, but there is still hope.
The night was well suited for clouds and rain, watching the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Persis, which includes 216000 kilometers per hour to the fastest shooting stars.
You have your name because they seem to come out of the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning is not far before the alarm clock ringing to sleep.
That's anything but relaxing.
After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feelings often or lasting their sleep as a relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express yourself?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and it is based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand belonging underneath is the insomnia, that is, an entry and penetration.
Especially the sleeping out, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagnknecht, board member in the German Division Association with Practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is a different disease.
"Very early awakening is often with depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors require each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and might begin to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you with sleep disorders to the doctor?
Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and impaired a day, should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: one is dropped, tired, uneasy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question.
There is hardly established in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, you should first turn to the family doctor in sleep problems, Weeß.
This can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens?
For example, for examination in the sleeping laboratory, medical professionals advise against snoring with respiratory disciplines, in pathological daytime fatigue, for sleeping walls or if one does not find the cause of a through-sleeping fault, Fietze explains.
You do not have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just do not take a lunch," says Fietze.
After wiring you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nasal glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws the sleeping.
How can affected get the problems under control?
There are pretty much set screws that can be used for better sleep.
WEEESS counts on: regular sleeping and onset times, not for too long in bed, do not sleep in the day, not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to expect it immediately, and that's all and that's allNot conducive.
What the jungle camp has missing medals in swimming
The former German Swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed itself on Facebook for disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had first brought gold at the short-run world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Dibler has placed protective in front of his ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of € 150,000 nobody wondering about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old in the night of Friday on his Facebook page.
The conveyor system in swimming sports is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, very good.
Thus we can not compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so carefully or even operate it on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he explained further.
He wanted to start a comeback, DEIBLER would have to be reported nine months before the first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"If you can not control a certain time before WM / OS from independent checkers of the WADA / FINA, may not participate," calls for the election Hamburger, which now operates an ice cream parlor.
Airport: gang of luggage docked
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Civil plunners of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage rods as a gang.
At around 21.30, civil officers recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf Airport, which was known to the policemen from past anti-theft offenses.
The two women and two men had committed several offenses since mid-July of this year and were jointly, division, and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove the thieves, which had specifically engaged in the commission of crimes to Germany, four deeds.
They had caught up over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a pair of Lindenbäumchen, in between still aest cobblestone paving: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look at the first glance, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go along the street from the east to the west, you can pass to playgrounds, a freshly salute kindergarten and a health care store.
To the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!"sprayed.
Compared to a Lidl, who should soon be demolished, is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
Article about this "trendy district", as the competent real estate company of Friedrichshain calls, but in recent weeks, it is preferably illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, the inhabitants have leases, but on the ground floor, however, spaces are still occupied and used for events.
Especially the Berlin Interior Senator Henkel had been repeatedly pronounced for a hard action of the police against the project since the beginning of the year, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were vacated, the police patrolled the police for three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three on-site team trolleys, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from itenter the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved off under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents walk with children walk, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of Lpi.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concerns of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, which traces three children here are annoyed above all by the police presence.
With the residents of house projects, they share the concern from rising rents and gentralization.
It does not sound like a neighborhood, which overall police protection against vandalizing left.
The ditch, which the Berlin interior sensor and the police open up between domestic surfers and their neighbors, does not apparently do not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers' quarter, which also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Also households and the resulting residential projects have long been part of Kiez: In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of Mainz street very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been vacated in a veritable street battle under great police facility, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming the magnet for tourists and election cancer in recent years: with them now residents from GDR times and former home surgery share their neighborhood.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent for new leases since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on throwing slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem, could be that they are not absolutely affected by the crime: offenses such as injury, statistics are almost exclusively against policemen.
The largest part of the offenses make assessments that tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, which lives in a tenement house next to 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, can not be a speech of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, she is appamirable: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars do not give it any longer in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect, their street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, lives together on the street and gets more with each other, as elsewhere."
Neugebauer deliberately pulled into Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That's why she was so important to her that the residents get back their street: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly suddenly claimed the interpretation so far over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugeauer, the road continues to take them away: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so good," she says.
"Violence and destruction I can not support absolutely."
But what should one do if anyone never listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For the drawn, which are annoyed about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Who pulls out, should be aware of it - just like someone pulling into a pub area, can complain bad about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the integration and organizer.
She is also social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else mixed.
Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sau, which has a problem above all.
Some had a few - less spotting than rather than the variety of desirable areas of responsibility, as the administration wanted to write the place.
We are looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just a egg-laying wool milk sau.
But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it go to organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes and network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent job limited to three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.
For connection accommodation, the municipalities are responsible.
You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.
The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district office to municipality and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work so far, they depend on private apartments, so deuschle.
Therefore, municipal apartments have to be rendered as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centers, school courts, one-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Customer.
Many work in the construction yard or help home masters, do nonprofit work - and motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outer effect.
That's "no employment therapy".
Activity does not only work.
The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and Customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also jump here.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain the refugees that it just takes and you can make the time meaningfully bridge, for example with language courses.
Who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, who will never integrate.
The significant majority is motivated.
However, there is also problem cases, says Customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all".The work of Deeuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mamma task".
A difficult question: have the two fear of radicalization in the recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Customer clearly, "what some namely like name".A residual risk could and would not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also topic with the refugees.
They would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely into trouble.
"You want to show that you have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So mainly and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that soon a new bump on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on-site helpers.
"In Urbach we have not arrived where we watch," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees that would relax the location.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already busy with integrating the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Burglar wanted with helicopter
The police helicopter flew about one hour different areas - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men were forcibly invaded an apartment at 8.50 am on Friday morning in an apartment building in Lindenweg.
