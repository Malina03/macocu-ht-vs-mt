Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic lights were put into operation at the village car park in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall traffic lights.
Two installations so close to each other: on purpose or a fool's errand?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at that time because it protects the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light protects cyclists as well as bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The system, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area 'Grub'.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light was needed for their safety," says Eckert.
Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office also confirms this.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the community of Gutach on the B 33 every day, about ten per cent of which are heavy goods vehicles," Arnold emphasises.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply comes first here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic inspections were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but rejected because of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
According to Arnold, everything had been tested beforehand when choosing the location of the traffic light poles: "Using a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles could drive out of Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without knocking the traffic light pole down.
The traffic light system itself, which cost around 15,000 euros, is the "most modern currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that drivers can easily see the lights even when the sun is low in the sky.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, the pedestrian is immediately given the green light; if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with walking difficulties cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone crosses the road safely," Arnold explained.
Of course, he said, motorists have to think as partners here and keep an eye on the lane.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic lights showed green for pedestrians, an upper-class vehicle rushed through - with the light on red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the hardships of his childhood and youth off his chest for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to brute force and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - many times.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer; theatre texts are rare in his oeuvre.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher has therefore put together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen at Garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatre-maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose passages from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which there is suggestive copulation and masturbation - the eight-member ensemble shimmies through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance glosses over the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, familiar from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Above all, the actresses get their turn in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic realisations.
They are touched hard, their heads submerged under water, their evening gowns tacked to the wall.
Squeezed into cellophane or girdles, they stalk through the production on dangerously high sticks, either monologuing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
The text, however, is hardly conveyed in this strained way.
The best moments of the evening are when they sing - ranging from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overwrought performance settle down a bit, and Winkler's downright absurd humour flashes.
Königsfeld: Small team does well
The volunteer fire brigade mastered its autumn rehearsal with flying colours despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
The fire brigade commander, Hans Kammerer, had chosen the Feder property in Burgberger Straße as the location for the exercise.
A short circuit is said to have occurred there during sawing.
The fire and smoke caused injuries to two people, one of whom was able to make an emergency call.
After the first check of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory protection personnel of the fire brigade prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was found and escorted outside.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to climb.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also bales of straw stored in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first fire-fighting attack was made via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was laid via a surface hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three fire-fighting attacks could be carried out.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what could be done with a small number of personnel.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld day task force.
The commander was satisfied with the way the exercise went.
Networking between universities and companies is important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, state parliament president Guido Wolf also visited Titisee-Neustadt to find out where tomorrow's workforce will come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he explored this important question together with the managing headmasters of the vocational schools as well as the district grammar school and the chairpersons of the parents' associations.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasised Claudia Stehle, headmistress of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the support centre, the district high school and the vocational school centre in the forest town.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also the phase around caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also argued that more and more employees were taking care of the care and support of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of employment," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor, he said, is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already become acquainted with the advantages of the region during their studies often remain in the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to strengthening the region," the state parliament president was convinced.
Only if enough apprenticeship places are offered can the demand for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the district's locational advantage is its advantageous location in southwestern Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
Furthermore, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport.
"Continue to be persistent and make sure that local public transport gets better," he declared to the address of the local politicians present.
An entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the senior citizens of Dieting to coffee, cake and then a snack.
In the past, the elderly citizens were entertained in the service area.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
The residents were delighted with the delicious cakes and pies.
Later they had sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old schoolyard facing Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, is again to be included in the renovation cost plan of the town of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, in order to stabilise and statically relieve the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next steps, according to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlingen town planning office, are to involve the state office for the preservation of historical monuments in the planning and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation is to be made by experts, which will then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this will probably be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school, which was built in 1912, the boundary wall, which is in need of renovation, must be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new foundation in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historical, one hundred year old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße is in need of renovation, mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, and has a forward slope.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapsing.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by pupils, which has been achieved by the current fixing work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was even planned for 2008/2009, but high unbudgeted expenses caused a postponement.
The State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments will have an important say in the renovation of the historic school wall, which has even been used for filming.
If the city of Bräunlingen has to comply with the requirements, it hopes to receive subsidies from the preservationists.
The pupils of Bräunlingen's primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new assembly hall, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to keep jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, federal chairman of the Green Party, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart conservatoire," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together, especially at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who is the favourite for a direct mandate in Stuttgart in the Bundestag elections on 22 September, thus contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, the government is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the Jazz and Pop course is to be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super-tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
Investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling at the border between Mexico and the USA.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had reportedly not yet been put into use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig their way under the radar," said Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference outside a San Diego warehouse where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured them, "If you continue to build tunnels like this and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both US authorities and Mexican security forces are in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime.
Constructed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year to build.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres wide.
It would thus also have been suitable for illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, they added at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it was the first time cocaine had been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get into the USA.
No details were given about those arrested, but at least one was Mexican, they said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisingen's year of celebration
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The anniversary of the town of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary of the first documentary mention is fast approaching.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year will be upon us.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in a document in 794.
A document was produced in Kirchen in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there is to be an official launch of the jubilee year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this launch event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
Within the framework of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1250th anniversary on a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Anniversary.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
The Kirchen-Hausen church festival will also take place on the same weekend.
Town music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the town music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year, the official date being the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger town anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
"It will not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014; in 1974, the present-day region was incorporated.
The new chronicle will be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many other anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki will begin on 8 February with a customs evening to celebrate its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and have its festive banquet on 29 March, and then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisingen school has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, and the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this at the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a deed of donation in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in Kirchen (Hausen), which was a court of law at the time.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year anniversary accordingly, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Council sets its sights on railway tracks
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councillors have decided.
Schiltach will have to spend 220,000 euros on the project.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at level crossings is to be improved - trains regularly collide with other vehicles all over Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to contribute one third of the costs, the rest will be shared by the railway and the federal government.
Roland Grießhaber, Schiltach's municipal architect, explained the special features of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing to the municipal council.
The town is planning to build a bulge west of the railway tracks at the mouth of the tunnel.
There, larger vehicles, for example those transporting long timber, could stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore suggested constructing a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjoining road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councillors doubted the necessity of widening the road: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to spend so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: the "Hirschen" level crossing is regularly used for long timber transports, he said.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is sometimes transported via this route because the up to 20-metre-long vehicles cannot use the route at the Häberlesbrücke bridge because they cannot turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it was foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the level crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councillors agreed to have a study carried out to determine the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Regardless of this, the reconstruction of the level crossing was approved by a majority with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall would be built in such a way that the town could, if necessary, widen the adjoining road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 metres for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could entail a completely different problem, concerning the access road to the steeply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the railway's reconstruction plans examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of Geroltzhäuser Weg would then still be possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the slope of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on it.
The responsibility for this, in turn, was borne by the city as the party responsible for road construction.
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Haas argued that since both logging and turning worked in the current state of development, the reconstruction of the level crossing should not be approved.
He also argued that the risk of a train colliding with a vehicle standing on the crossing was much lower at this point than at the other level crossings because the Mitte stop was directly next to it, to which there was a good line of sight.
Even trains coming from the main station would have to be slowed down enough at this point to avoid a collision.
The majority of the councillors refused to agree to the reconstruction of this level crossing, as the town of Schiltach would have to "take the blame" for the problem of vehicles hitting the tracks, as the railway company could withdraw from its responsibility once the construction work had been completed.
The committee considers the reconstruction of the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway, to be unproblematic.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the running.
Distant worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets in other stars.
No one knows whether there is life on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or should we search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that those responsible at the European Space Agency Esa are currently asking themselves.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that will decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launches are expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees are reviewing the proposals and asking the researchers about them.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To investigate this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined more closely.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres to search for "biomarkers": Gases that are considered indicative of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved an M-class mission (the budget there is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa is planning the first of a total of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it will reach Jupiter to study the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps deviations will also be found that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose umbrella all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what is it made of?
Our cosmos was created 13.7 billion years ago by the big bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which makes up stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, whose effect accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers know neither which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an M mission here, too, which is scheduled for launch in 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe across the entire sky for the first time and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could win the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-mission.
Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time predicted by Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago.
To date, they have not been detected.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
In contrast to systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, among other things; "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system; "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation; and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and study Earth-like planets.
Already eliminated are, among others, proposals for sample return transport from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The topic of the day in the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Sayings from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairperson of the parish council, went into detail about biblical proverbs in a talk after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain words of wisdom, precepts or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical passages and explained the meaning.
She named proverbs like: Wooden eye be watchful, like scales falling from the eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives it to his own in sleep, wash one's hands of innocence.
Several times the speaker had her audience guess which proverb it was.
Christel Dehner, a member of the parish council, took a look at sayings from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make blue, spank something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridges to the past".
At the end, a raffle was held.
The prizes lay covered on a table and were humorously paraphrased before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of being unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry starts today in the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to become skilled workers for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new about it is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants do not become unemployed, the companies get trained skilled workers who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate of 3.1 per cent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the employment agency in Sonthofen.
This is because many companies have reacted cautiously to hiring so far.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer, is that "we have hardly any skilled workers in the trades, in health care and in geriatric care".
Due to the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been coming in again since September.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
The full background report on this can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management announced on Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported that several people were injured.
US President Barack Obama was being kept informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3 and eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, according to several media reports.
One traveller told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travellers were screaming and children were crying.
Panic broke out among the waiting people, many of whom hid behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveller told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like something out of a movie".
Afterwards, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots were reportedly fired near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
Television pictures showed numerous ambulances and police cars pulling up outside a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special task force and a rifle lying on the ground.
The airport management said on Twitter that the incident began at 9.30am (local time).
Access roads were closed, causing long tailbacks, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes could be seen taking off on CNN.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles' LAX airport is one of the largest airports in the US.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations marking its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two church services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two church services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. during the service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des heiliges Opfers der Messe", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its composition.
The mass will be performed as part of the church service, as its commissioner Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the brass section of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism gives way to confidence
With the elections for the parish council in 2015, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral unit of Haslach (SE).
There will then be only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
For there is nothing more to be done about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new is hesitantly but visibly giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt used a presentation to explain the newly formulated guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
According to these guidelines, SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a corporation under public law, which will take over the rights and duties of the previous six individual parishes.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor is represented by virtue of his office.
There will be at least two elected members from each parish, and so-called parish teams will be formed locally in the six parishes.
Their task in future will be to promote church life in the locality.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then revealed a considerable need for discussion.
The changes provide that accumulated assets in the parishes remain earmarked for a specific purpose.
Liabilities, on the other hand, will be transferred to the parish as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose obligations would then affect all the parishes, there was great concern.
"In the past, too, investments were only made in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone," put Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach into perspective.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, chairperson of the committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral unit.
In 2006, they had set themselves the task of "becoming one, remaining five" and had to realise that this was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set about answering the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The elaborations will be concretised in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity will become more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to prepare for higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, managing director of the public utility company, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four in Pfullendorf will have to pay 70 to 90 euros more per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is set every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity lines.
They quantify the additional costs they incur from the energy turnaround, which they can levy through a levy on the electricity price.
Stadtwerke Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal utility could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We are assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, adding that the figure would be closer to 2 cents.
Traffic lights on steady red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street doesn't react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive on red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is clear, he can continue driving, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "reasonable", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before assuming that the traffic light is malfunctioning.
However, anyone who continues to drive despite a red light must be aware that he or she is fully to blame for any accident caused as a result.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not be waiting long enough, warns Becker, referring to a decision of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the case heard, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of steady red and had to answer for a negligent red light offence.
The traffic light was not defective, but changed to green a short time later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal council happy about solid budget
Whenever the budget is discussed in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster always has a good laugh.
The municipal coffers in Herdwangen-Schönach are well filled and the administration has not had any debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be considered a complete success.
This became clear during the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at about 1.8 million euros, was also about one million euros higher than budgeted.
The surplus was mainly due to higher trade tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The property budget was again well above the planned figures.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the allocation to reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by about 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't just shake something like this out of your sleeve," praised Gerster, referring to the annual accounts.
He and the councillors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dearly.
Thanks to its good financial situation, the municipality was able to forego high tax rates in the past.
According to Gerster, this in turn has often meant that subsidies from the state have been cut.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various equalisation funds.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain assessment rates.
"We have to look at the issue of assessment rates, as we have investments coming up in the next few years for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history with the men's choral society Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, during which he was ceremoniously honoured.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his male choral society.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which he has become more than fond of.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral advisor on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and an engraved pewter plate.
Besides the honouring, the 31st autumn festival went on in the usual way: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Sängerabteilung Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringen choirs had invited a colourful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
In honour of their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they serenaded him with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The Männergesangverein Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided the women's quota for the festival with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor".
The mixed choir whisked away to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folk tune "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their programme.
The singing section of the Baisinger Sports Club returned to home territory with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein provided the crowning musical finale.
There was a small side programme for the children - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Punch and Judy show and read a few stories, which kept the children well occupied throughout the afternoon.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centres in the Zollernalbkreis are receiving mail these days.
The Schwarzwälder Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the institutions in realising their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalb district can take part in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply to the Schwarzwälder Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the kindergarten building site campaign.
A jury consisting of representatives from the Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb will select three wishes from all entries.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realisable with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must provide many hard-working construction helpers.
What is it about the campaign day and the helpers?
Bauhaus, with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb, provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be used directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the teachers and children themselves.
Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream Come True for the FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost none of its significance for the town and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for some reason were left out in the cold.
The musicians who framed the ceremony were just as sorry as some of the speakers.
FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of a dream come true, also got wet.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the realisation of the project, the local council, the participating companies and club members who got involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners laid 400 square metres of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also acknowledged by the Member of the Landtag Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given by Hubert Baier on behalf of the municipal sports committee, Kuno Kayan, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded the audience that recurring weather conditions in spring and autumn had affected the original grass pitch to such an extent that it could not be played on.
The first ideas for solving the problem came 15 years ago, when the construction of a third pitch at the football club's grounds or at the secondary school at Salinensee were considered.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts of building an artificial turf sports field came up, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube on a ground lease, agreed to contribute 100,000 euros to the cost of building the pitch and the state approved subsidies of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to pay the remaining 356,000 euros of the total costs of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarised.
Construction of the 68 by 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4 June.
During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used to build a dirt-bike track.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations with the topics of interior affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin this morning.
Among other things, the topics are direct democracy, bribery of members of parliament and the federal police.
In the morning, the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its consultations.
One of the issues to be discussed is dual citizenship, a subject on which both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the CDU/CSU rejects a dual passport.
On the topic of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD underlined its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A toll sticker would be a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained Florian Pronold, the SPD negotiator for the transport issue, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
There was a risk of traffic being diverted to rural roads, which were already accident blackspots.
In Pronold's view, the introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would only be a first step.
"There is a danger that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it really be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for pop star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver seriously injured in an accident
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempener Außenring in the direction of Grefrath at around 9.15 pm.
As she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: Closure after accident at Schänzle roundabout
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was driving out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening at around 8 pm.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was in the left turn lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This caused a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old man from Constance.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old man driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
According to the police, the total damage to property was about 15,000.
The road had to be closed while the accident was being investigated.
Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this one will no longer be made at Vienna International Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements will thus be eliminated - the noise level should thus be significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna International Airport is following an international trend by discontinuing announcements concerning individual persons.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, among others, have already dispensed with the noisy calls.
The discontinuation of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls sound through the loudspeakers on a given day - should make things quieter at the airport in the future.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all the other information about changed gates or departure times went down a bit here," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake wagon pull with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have a Swabian touch at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individuals compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not the distance that counts," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The log has to be dropped vertically, should roll over once and then come to rest straight.
That is awarded the most points.
In horseshoe throwing, it's all about accuracy.
A stake is thrown from a distance of eight metres.
The participants have to prove their skill and strength in carrying water buckets over 50 metres.
Time and the amount of water in a bucket are measured at the end.
Two members of each "clan" or team are then allowed to take part in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competitions will receive prizes.
Training starts at 10 am.
Suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in a kilt.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
The jury will award a few bonus points for the "outfit".
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there will be plenty of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, brass band fans will get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the birabohemian brass band from Schömberg will perform the evening's entertainment.
The band plays lively polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen, known as the singing innkeeper and black sausage baron, will be there.
He has already performed in Dornhan at the Christmas Market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the Leinstetten Music Association will entertain at the morning pint, and from 2 p.m. the Böffingen Farmers' Band will be the guest, and the "Oldies" will bring the festival to a close.
On Friday, the festival kicks off with the "Stoppelackerparty" with DJ Ralf.
Other programme items on Saturday and Sunday include the vintage car and tractor rally, exhibitions by companies on the theme of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize maze, the crafts market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there will be a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan nutrition requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The Vegetarierbund lists others for World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The German Vegetarian Association suggests a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt can be replaced by soy yoghurt.
Soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used instead of milk.
Whipped vegetable cream can replace conventional whipped cream.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
Half a mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of applesauce or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
Instead of egg, a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of cornflour and three tablespoons of mineral water can be used to loosen dough.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800,000 people in Germany currently eat a vegan diet, i.e. a purely plant-based diet.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American metropolis New York.
After an eight-hour flight, they went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which they reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here we had a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly attractive in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city never sleeps", the day was concluded at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot on the second day.
Afterwards, they went via the financial centre around Wall Street to the September 11 memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to get an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-metre-high observation deck of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view.
Afterwards, they walked through the hustle and bustle of New York's streets via Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Once again this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße on St. Hubert's name day.
According to legend, St. Hubert was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn band of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays parforce horns (natural horns in E-flat tuning) to old, originally French melodies.
The horn players wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and hounds on drag hunts.
The solemn mass will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 am.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name its programme.
According to the dictionary, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of the visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain a mere feeling of déjà vu.
After all, the café with the beautiful name aims to do just that: to make an actual stay not just a mental experience, but a tangible one that can be experienced again and again.
Because it's fun and simply beautiful.
A look at the interior at Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team headed by founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner pampers guests with a wide variety of coffees or cocktails.
This is accompanied by delicious cakes or fresh baguettes with individual toppings.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the smart café at Opschlag: In Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
The friendly café lovers hope the move to Opschlag in Kleve will attract more visitors.
Not least because of the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner emphasises.
Rather, they want to address young students as well as senior citizens and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee experience.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations yourself.
Expresso fan
Daniel Büttner is more of an expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt a cappuccino drinker.
"With a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There have already been two events in the bright café.
Or rather one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's cup of tea.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a fan of event evenings: "You can't please everyone.
And with an event, I only address those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events tend to be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt normal business as little as possible.
In other words: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is increasingly becoming a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many people in Kleve, guests from near and far and students who are discovering the gastronomy mile and with it Café Déjà Vu.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation celebration to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness all under the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation celebration is also a suitable occasion to present awards.
This time, secretary Rolf Wagener was pleased to receive the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but have also done many a round for us, for which our heartfelt thanks," said the choir's chairman Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place went to music supervisor Artur Brückner.
The Board of Directors expressed special thanks to the team of Ange Pier-Ribbert, the club hostess, who had once again conjured up a first-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals on Tuesdays at 7.45 pm in the clubhouse.
"New voices who enjoy singing are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four match days, the mood at the handball team in the first division is still good.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"I don't know what a win like that tastes like any more," says Malmon, expecting a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet pulled up any trees, Malmon raises a warning finger in advance.
I coached many of the players myself in the A-youth.
That's why they will be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"We'll also have to wait and see whether they'll have reinforcements from the first team," said the SG coach.
In order to finally get back on track, Malmon's team will definitely have to improve compared to their past performances.
Above all, the team's defensive work and the transition game have been lacking lately.
We also have to improve the way we use our chances.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally cleared their heads during the short break.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof once again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach. On Sunday, his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From his arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had created an entertaining play, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience along as narrator through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his Freihof.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the great son of the town.
In true style, he drove up in a carriage and "Black Forest foxes" owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, but also by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well how to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music to round off the performance.
The mayor of Haslach, Heinz Winkler, then did the honours of presenting the honorary citizenship, representing the then incumbent Hättich, together with part of the town council.
Afterwards, the Epiphany singers paid their respects, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, memories of my own Epiphany days come alive again.
They delighted the audience in the Freihof with their song "O Jesulein", as did the Stork Day children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
Hansjakob had voiced his criticism of the official church at that time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
He found his resting place in the Heimaterde, behind his burial chapel on the Brand near Hofstetten.
"A restless spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home for good," was the comment at the end of the scene play.
There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Neckar Giants' hopes are growing
The chances of the relegated Ludwigsburg basketball team staying in the league have increased.
If there is a wild card procedure, the Neckar Giants will now have one less competitor.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project will refrain from applying for a possible wildcard spot.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, there was no initial sigh of relief from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wild card procedure as long as it was not certain that Düsseldorf would not receive a licence," Neckar Giants boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, promoted Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove their economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been refused a licence twice.
The court of arbitration is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord's Supper comes into focus
As the town's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Protestant Church in Haigerloch, the town's culture and tourism office is dedicating the last of its public themed tours this year to the Church of the Lord's Supper on Sunday, 27 October.
After a visit to the Atomkeller Museum, the tour will look at the Haigerloch period after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The highlight of the tour is a visit to the Abendmahlskirche (Church of the Last Supper).
There, the tour participants are told the story of the building of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also offers a view of the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one-and-a-half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkeller Museum.
The Haigerloch tourist office is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, they said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is practically impossible.
"In that case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden could face extradition there, it added.
Perseverance pays off
Six men's teams fought for the title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was the main focus of the tournament.
Five matches per team were on the schedule, with everyone playing against everyone else.
The tournament was played in doubles mode with one long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter runs the tournament
Anja Schlichter was in charge of the tournament, assisted by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were tied on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both SG Rohrweiler teams), so the last two matches had to decide the match.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to present the challenge cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath in the home stretch.
Second place went to the doubles Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze podium was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
With late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake, the tournament came to a successful close.
On the last weekend in August, the Black Forest Open Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous hands-on activities and events as part of the summer holiday programme.
"Young and old can learn various old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, twisting candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
Regional craftsmen will be on hand to help the children from 11 am to 5 pm.
There will also be crafts in the museum workshop.
Young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship by building cuckoo whistles, water wheels or spinning tops.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt walking, also promise lots of fun.
Speed and coordination are in demand here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum with riddles on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 noon and 2 pm respectively.
On a tour of the grounds, the children have to guess which stories are true or which are lies.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and marvelled at on the grounds.
On Sunday, children can also look forward to Otsch the clown, who will be playing tricks on the museum guests from 11 am.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner's storytelling will be cosy and fairytale-like.
The storyteller will take the young guests on a journey through the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11 am, 1 pm and 3 pm.
In addition, the children's traditional dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 am.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom-maker, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker will let visitors look over their shoulders at their traditional work.
A varied holiday programme awaits visitors to the open-air museum until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable oddball because he has set his sights on entering a race in America on his motorbike, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt cannot be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he sails to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film, there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also involved in wind turbine logistics.
The hard coal shimmers black in the storage area in front of the dyke.
Two huge blue stockpiling and reloading machines distribute or load the coal here as required.
Every time the handling equipment moves, a shrill warning noise sounds across the site.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, when the wind is unfavourable, it can be heard from far away - and so there have already been some complaints from people in the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, they are now working on technical measures to keep the warning signals quieter.
In the future, he will continue to rely on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot of plans for the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard is continuing to import coal for power plants and is one of the big players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the recessed 18.5-metre berth in front of the terminal, capesize bulk carriers have long been able to be handled here.
"This year we want to break the 3-million-tonne mark in terms of throughput," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF Suez power plant is also connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could handle up to 10 million.
Bavaria's basketball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe that we can also win against the best team in Europe of the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic summed up after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus on Thursday night.
We have sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
In only their third appearance in the European Champions League, the Munich team sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not composed enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors first managed the feat of turning a 15-point deficit into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champions, but then made careless mistakes again," Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful scorers for Munich, who had celebrated emphatic victories in their first two games against Italian serial champions Montepaschi Siena and Polish title holders Zielona Góra.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany, Iran expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process.
"After years, an agreement has been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the past years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
Although there is still a long way to go, the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will reach a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmate with machete
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old boy.
The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
They then played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighbourhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger boy, whom they had taken with them, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the course of events to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted to the premeditated killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other things, the older boy cited a rivalry in a football game as the reason.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric juvenile institution.
Pimp must go to prison
The Constance Regional Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threatening, insulting and dangerous bodily harm.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession during a plea bargain.
According to the confession, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent against their will to the streets after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the earnings of the women, some of whom had been procuring for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented the women from contacting the outside world.
Together with a colleague who arranged the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partially monitored in order to control their earnings.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental impairment and thus a limited capacity to commit crimes, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to question any of the victimised women.
As a police official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings could be identified through telephone surveillance measures after the first report.
The intercepted conversations were characterised by a high level of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their ordeal.
Another witness, one of whom had discovered bruises all over her body, had not made any statement until today.
She was a "completely broken personality" who saw violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The accused regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He had broken away from these circles and wanted to lead a completely normal life after prison," he said.
Of the happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach.
With this Bedouin wisdom, first chairperson Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already boast considerable successes.
The first chair Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself visited Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, further cooperation developed and gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site during several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former mayor of Nagold, had suggested equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work for the association in an advisory capacity, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn built the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of barely a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott.
Especially interesting at a time when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalised.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, Henne said, for example deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to observe in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling about Mercedes cars from Mauritania that had been converted into a mobile goat shed and by describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivation, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realised how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans to control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy requires global philanthropy.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, French football will indeed go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the tax on the rich, the government and professional football in France have reached an impasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 per cent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposing side also remained firm.
The strike announced for the end of November will now go through, announced the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will therefore be cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage," said Mayor Jens Häußler, opening the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the community hall to hear the planned measures explained, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built-up properties as possible," says Häußler.
The planning is based on protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by adding a 15 percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100a climate".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100a protection, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, and the municipality can count on state subsidies of about 70 per cent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that funding is only available if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented to the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
After the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns.
Among other things, they questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the village.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasised that the interaction of all the measures presented was necessary to achieve the desired goal.
Furthermore, it was necessary to find the most economical solution, said Joachim Wald of Wald und Corbe.
Residents of the old town were displeased because even during normal thunderstorms, the sewer system is repeatedly overloaded.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed up.
He said the municipality is obliged to design the sewer system in such a way that it can cope with two- to three-year rain events.
Making the sewers larger would cost millions.
Serious injuries after collision
Two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on State Road 44 near Revensdorf early Friday afternoon.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but were initially unable to say much about the course of the accident.
However, there were several witness statements that had to be analysed first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old female driver of a VW Golf was driving in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf was coming towards her in his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so severely trapped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreckage of the vehicle.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The road remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
The kinship in appearance is amazing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as an explorer and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is by all means considered something in his own country.
Some titles are published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is distributed by Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security mania and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, maybe drugs had done something to his brain.
He understood, early on, that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of computers and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates from 1956, it gives off the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
It develops the principle of "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is frighteningly similar to our own, mutants look into the future - and the police take action.
"We capture individuals who haven't broken any laws," says the agency's chief.
"We catch them even before they can commit a violent crime".
And: "In our society there are no felons, for that we have a penal camp full of pesudo criminals". They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative seems like the blueprint for anti-terror laws and the NSA's bugging spree.
Anticipation of the attack: this is also how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story doesn't end there.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own premises.
It not only accepts mistakes and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Merkel spy affair testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the Interfax agency reported.
Earlier yesterday, Green Party member of parliament Hans-Christian Ströbele became the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to discuss the affair.
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
A special fair at the Domäne in Hechingen gave tips on how to make the wedding celebration a success.
Important wedding suppliers were represented.
One trend: the retro look has returned.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, preferably muted or in cream.
The dresses, which are often ruched and embroidered, are closed at the front, often with a veil, while at the back they go down the back and often end in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch from the Kleidermüller fashion house points out, there is a difference of opinion.
For men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of venue is important, she explained.
Unadorned adjoining rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the coach house.
For those who want to drive up in a carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
"Carriages are also popular for hen parties," he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. series of shots at special locations, preferably waterfalls, for example, a few days after the celebration, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog lovers successful
Once again, the athletes of the Hundefreunde Bitz were successful at a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with his 15-month-old Marley he brought it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp and her Woody faced the critical eyes of the judge in class 1.
Unknown persons injure girl by shooting from car
Unknown persons have injured a twelve-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt by shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had fired at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening, presumably with an air gun.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on her left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
One window was broken.
They then drove away.
The criminal investigation department is investigating, it said on Friday.
So far, the Kempten police department can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to children throwing eggs against the facades of houses.
As the house owners recognised this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, no damage to property is likely to have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably set off in the city area, but again no property damage was caused.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car had been wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel trims stolen.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man had recovered all his wheel covers in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with prospects for the future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Her house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old stock of trees, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes to the city by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the doorframe.
I've been looking for a new flat for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the worry that in old age I will no longer be able to manage the many stairs to the house and in the flat, she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
She recently published a book on the subject of 'Living happily in old age - Which form of housing is best for me?
Our flat is the best example of what is not possible in old age," she begins.
When she moved into the maisonette with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was simply a beautiful flat in the middle of greenery.
Today, in her mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them suppress it as long as they can.
It's always the others who get old,' she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do people start to think about it.
But by then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
But which form of living one chooses is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no one solution for old age.
Even those who can afford a retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become ill.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the local language, one will become lonely even in the dolce vita,' the author of the reference book reminds those willing to resettle.
Among her models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often-cited pensioners' shared apartment.
In old age, everyone has their own tics and quirks
For me, however, such a shared flat would be nothing," she says with a twinkle in her eye.
Especially not like a student flat-share with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
When you get older, you simply need some space to retreat," says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the possibility of a shared flat for senior citizens.
But it would have to be different from a classic student flat-share.
And sometimes you just want your peace and quiet,' she believes.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the state capital.
Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own flat as long as possible,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service Leben im Alter of the state capital.
Her office advises people on all aspects of 'getting older'.
This is why older people in particular would often accept inconveniences and restrictions just to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make a house or flat barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are considering the age-appropriate conversion of their house or flat should first inform themselves thoroughly and not hire the first craftsman they see.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversions.
Even in rented flats, one or two things can be done, even if it is only to raise the toilet seat, explains the interior designer.
But it is not always possible to redesign an existing flat to make it age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is beautifully situated.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although a stair lift could be installed inside the flat, the path to the flat door, which is also paved with stairs, would be by far the greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal property for her and her husband.
She dreads the move more than the spider on her door.
USA to continue prosecuting Snowden
The USA has not changed its position on former US intelligence agent Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of having passed on secret information without permission.
Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the USA, said US State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden's latest statements would not change this.
Earlier, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's comments were those of a parliamentarian, not a member of the German government.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is in principle willing to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to have his situation clarified.
The former NSA employee, who is wanted by the US, made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To those responsible
I have been asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States on a contract or direct employment basis as a technical expert.
In the course of my employment at these agencies, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government that prompted me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced severe and persistent harassment that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am heartened by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These spying revelations drew many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of the public trust.
The benefits to society from these lessons learned are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalise and impeach political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will shed this derogatory attitude.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council in its most recent meeting, which was not open to the public.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," Maier emphasised.
The budget had set aside 100,000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is pleased that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the building, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the pavement.
"That expense is now gone," Maier is pleased to say.
Concert in high summer temperatures
The Hammereisenbach music society gives a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the baton at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairperson Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to make the first Musikerhock a success.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail actually means electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service e-mail, was the secrecy of the letter technically implemented in a similar way to conventional post?
When the early Internet services were designed, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, no attention was paid in the basic technical protocols to creating a stable foundation for an aurally secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's email programme or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider.
If she has a GMail account, for example, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
Along the way, the mail can go through quite a few other servers on the internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional emails read on their way through the network?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on their way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the email has a malicious programme as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient's system.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorised people reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal possibilities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against being read?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against being read.
With a great deal of technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication so that it is not even possible to readily identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail's shares had fallen recently, Google's GMail was able to make significant gains.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg came up with a plan.
He buried the dead woman in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
According to police investigations, a 67-year-old man from Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in a forest in order to continue collecting his pension and care allowance.
At first, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he collected the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old man has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
According to the statement, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they investigated further.
They found out that the two had lived together in the same flat for more than 15 years and that he had been caring for her.
The 67-year-old finally admitted to the death of his mother.
According to the police, a post-mortem examination revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
TSV Morsum is still without a point in the handball league after six match days.
Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers' team will play a derby against TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated their first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope that we can finally clear our heads," says Ehlers with cautious optimism.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, also relies on a fast-paced game.
Therefore, we have to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, we have to improve our defence, which has made anything but a safe impression lately.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a big one.
But that doesn't make us the favourites, because anything can happen in a derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to go one better in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
Instead, the A-youth player Joost Windßuß, who has double playing rights with the A-youth Bundesliga team HC Bremen, will celebrate his season debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Flat fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers recover charred body
The fire brigade had to be called out in Helmbrechts late on Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof caught fire on Friday night.
Rescue workers recovered a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
A police spokesman in Bayreuth said it was still unclear whether the body was that of a resident.
Late on Thursday evening, there was a fire on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, flames were already coming out of a window.
The emergency services went into the flat and found the body in one room.
This room and another room burnt out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson explained further.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its current 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine one's own work and daily routine.
With Burfien, the regional church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full-time basis to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
Yet the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
As pastors, they could be very close to the people.
They would earn as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Of course, they are paid more in the private sector, but theologians have a secure employer.
This suits today's young people, who are not only interested in a career, but also in meaningful work.
According to the regional church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 theology graduates begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to fill positions in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Studying theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President with it.
Before the Revier derby against Schalke, BVB supporters had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena with flares.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that the onlooker was confronted with until shortly before kick-off of the Bundesliga match between German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the chants could be heard from the visiting fans.
The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are located, initially presented itself as exceptionally quiet: No chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the capo, who usually coordinates the collective cheering, remained unoccupied.
And right at the front of the stand, a large flag with the inscription "Sektion Stadionverbot" (Stadium ban section) was flying lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the pitch, did a short burst of cheers erupt.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but by no means everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand, nothing stirred.
Even when stadium announcer Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last few days - the derby win, the victory over Arsenal, the contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - it did not create a mood of celebration.
It was not until five minutes before kick-off that the capo climbed his podium - and the tension that had been almost palpable until then was released in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, asked about the mood in the stands in the stadium.
Last up, as always, was the south stand - and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stand up" came from the south stand at kick-off, everything was as usual again.
The silence beforehand was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired flares into the stands and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The match was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the leaders of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if Watzke's words are to be believed, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans' representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were presented with various options for punishment - they now have until Tuesday to decide on one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, BVB will determine a sanction by the end of next week.
"That will be drastic," Watzke assured .
It will be interesting to see how the reactions in the South Stand will turn out then.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service whistleblower Edward Snowden is interested in helping Germany to clear up the increasingly explosive NSA spy affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party in the Bundestag, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence agent would testify before a German public prosecutor or a committee of enquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic framework data are right and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to the rest of Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out at the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
A look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In Great Britain, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive return," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and Bunds is at a historically high level, he added.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his split from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, due to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said "life sometimes doesn't go exactly the way we plan or hope".
Kerr and himself still love each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as parents to Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their baby son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to encyclopaedias, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, yet differs from it in quite significant ways.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a hearty Edam cheese, these gourmet treats are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan refrains from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, you might ask, but on closer inspection, the vegan dietary world is characterised by considerable ingenuity.
"Spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which stocks a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Then, at the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers faux leather to normal leather.
He realised that it is also possible to go without animal products in other everyday matters.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor pronounces the vegan's maxim, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, he says vegans quickly discovered entirely new products, and enthusiasm soared.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan does not represent renunciation, asceticism, but rather it is an enrichment." Proctor attributes the assumption that changing one's diet reduces the choice of food options more to the power of habit.
And it is precisely this conditioning that causes many a well-intentioned attempt to fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many people give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And he adds: "Certain tastes cannot be attributed to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the way they are prepared that make the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For a barbecue, for example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He makes sure to have a balanced, varied diet, which should also include some hearty food.
Of course you want to have something in your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste good, but that can't just be reduced to animal food," says Proctor.
He has not suffered any health damage up to and including eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he says.
For me, the change has had a positive aspect.
I don't ingest foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat a vegan diet exclusively.
"My blood values are excellent, I get myself checked often," reveals Proctor.
Many critics of veganism warn against the lack of vitamin B12 in particular.
"Since animals are fed on feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there is also the option of taking the coenzyme in tablet form, he adds.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to travel far to get food.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need locally.
Only now and then do I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the ready-made products are expensive, but that is also the case with "ordinary" ready-made products.
In any case, preparing vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, Proctor was able to amaze even his in-laws with his vegan cheesecakes.
The vegan adds a new spice to family celebrations.
It has dynamism, when you cook together it has a new meaning.
"The situations that can arise are as varied as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been met with scepticism.
'Don't you like my food anymore?
"Am I supposed to feel bad about drinking milk now?" - with questions like that, he says, you have to act with tact as a vegan.
"I'm not rejecting people, I'm part of this society," says Proctor, who doesn't want to live an enclave existence.
And if we take a closer look, the everyday world does not seem as alien to vegans as we might think - and vegans are not as restricted in their everyday lives as is generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are chips everywhere!
"Many kebab shops offer falafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he switches to pasta dishes or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are slowly adapting to this.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough requests, they might be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as Kombüse in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor harbours the wish that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, literally, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure-fire way to make the vast majority impossible in the first place," says Proctor.
However, shopping for vegan products can be a little tricky at first, he adds.
Especially when you learn to understand that even peanuts can contain animal additives as colouring agents, it seems that with so many hurdles and pitfalls to follow, you quickly lose heart.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"Gradually you develop a scanner's eye and know which signs and logos to look out for "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it's an important moral finger pointing at consciousness.
It may not quite succeed in getting people to drop their habits, but at least it can teach consumers to critically examine their habits.
Exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers on tenterhooks.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of minor and major glitches at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in the data transport.
In August of this year, there were two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent masses of erroneous buy orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and cancel them.
Two days later, half of all share trading in the USA came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The IPO of Facebook also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) later found, and ordered the company to pay a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Cyclist knocks down 63-year-old man
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was riding a woman's bicycle on the left-hand pavement from Bahnhofplatz in the direction of Marktstätte, in violation of the regulations, at around 10 pm on Thursday evening.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the pavement from a pub, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to police.
In the ensuing collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the building, went down and sustained a laceration of about 15 centimetres on his head.
An ambulance team took the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.
Painting the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" (Swiss Meadow) beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
They also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house at the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the area is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed on the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI's action, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been put up.
However, this did not bother the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative much during their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against building ruins".
With this, they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the giant project fail one day.
Talking to many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the city will be better off with the realisation of the project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, according to the BI.
It was heard that the mayor's public statements are also having an effect.
Mai had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal baths if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the referendum.
Some seem downright frightened because of this, others feel it is a "clumsy attempt at blackmail" on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Rangnick scolds referees: Mane no swallow king
As pleased as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed with the referees.
"There is a dangerous tendency at the moment for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he defended the two offensive whirlwinds at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Mane's yellow card in the 3-0 win over Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was ruled guilty of alleged play-acting - which admittedly was not a play, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatantly wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely out of his depth".
Harkam had also "contributed his share" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He resolutely defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation.
Schmidt himself claims to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the run of success, however, Rangnick sang a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for it: really good," he stated.
There is not much to criticise.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let that continue.
There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer season.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Norway: Norwegian town makes light of itself with giant mirrors
The inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley with giant mirrors.
Because of the low level of sunlight, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, normally sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors 45 metres above the ground, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the valley's inhabitants prepared sun chairs, others put on sunglasses to be on the safe side.
Until now, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented a proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea had already existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million kroner (about 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine for the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
Post office hardly ever empties on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for Sunday emptying are still on various letterboxes in the core city and the city districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and public holidays," informs the FDP.
An enquiry by the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, the bins are only emptied in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and at Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
The answer to the FDP's question did not say whether the post offices in Hofheim and Rosengarten were also emptied on Sundays.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to look into this.
Emptying mail on Sundays is an important postal service, especially for mail with deadlines.
"Despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, this company is radically and unacceptably reducing this service.
Thomas Bittner, leader of the Liberal parliamentary group and city association, supports his parliamentary group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being secretly changed or even cancelled.
The post office is miles away from being close to its citizens.
"At the very least, the letterboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied on Sundays again," say Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
The same applies to the city centre: citizens who are not mobile should be able to reach a letterbox emptied on Sundays on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there was also Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
After all, her party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate will discuss a proposal by Stefan Majer (Greens), head of the city's transport department.
According to the proposal, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.
In return, however, not the prices are to be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines is to be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council still has to decide.
The retail committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce (IHK) thinks this is "not a good idea".
The parking possibility directly in front of the shop is "an advantage for smaller retailers that should not be underestimated".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions catch hosts off guard
With a small squad, the men's team of TSV Freudenstadt had to play TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The Älbler were indeed on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became clear that they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt team, also due to their age.
The Gönningers had a hard time with the hard and well-placed serves.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz passed cleanly over the middle of the net and were not on the spot when it came to blocking.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-dominating performance, the third set was won somewhat laxly and listlessly for a final score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, TV Baiersbronn, who won clearly in Nagold, will be a much stronger opponent.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and point gifts, especially when receiving the ball; precision was also lacking at times in the passes and in some critical scenes of play, overzealousness prevented the team from looking at possible point wins.
In this very evenly matched match, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team showed great physical effort and a pleasing level of commitment from both teams.
Care day at the little Englishman's hut
A group of committed participants met at the small Englishman's hut in Ibach for the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project in the upper Hotzenwald.
Based on suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut was to be cleared on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the care day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between people and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council after the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the campaign a good success.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of the "Weitblick" coincides with the goal of preserving the now heavily overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting it to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of wooded areas.
They need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss the opportunity to speak up for the planned biosphere area.
Not only does the current measure fit seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplementation of what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous maintenance days for the future.
After these various explanations, forest ranger Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the forestry tractor was ready to be called up if necessary.
One group of helpers was to take care of clearing juniper bushes and maintaining a dry stone bar.
The aim was to have a clear view at the lookout point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal utilities, can be described as an attractive town, no second mayoral candidate has yet come forward.
The only candidate so far to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for mayor for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The deadline for applications is 6 p.m. on Monday, 11 November.
Falkenberg Discotheque Provides Two Great Evenings
The new season at the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it's "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Of course, the organisers promise fat beats and cool sounds on both days.
Worker falls from ladder: seriously injured
While replacing a defective outdoor sensor, a 51-year-old worker fell from a ladder in Eggelsberg on Thursday and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outer façade of an inn.
When he climbed onto the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg regional hospital by the "Christophorus 6" rescue helicopter.
Rapist in South Africa: two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life terms on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the severe injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier in the week.
The crime had caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
Doctors fought for 14 hours for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The sight of the teenager was so horrific that the nurses needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the trial to being in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because there was not enough evidence against them.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times as many as in Germany, which, however, with 82 million people, has considerably more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate that the number of unreported cases of sexual violence is 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV programme "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for ham is the pig's legs, turbo fattening is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham that you can get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, as the boss of the big ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the "Adler" company in Bonndorf works.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
He only enters the factory with hair protection and a smock.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he is allowed to take the microphone.
Jumbo sighted at a fast food restaurant in Waldshut for refreshments
"They work in huge quantities here," the TV producers marvel, "Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 legs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what matters when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with standards?
Details like the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm curious to see what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in its purest form.
But it is still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the cutting of the legs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found boneless on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
The smoke tower and smoke firing system visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally turn the ham almost black.
"Now the slice disappears into the jumbo," he announces the test meal.
"It's really tasty," is the TV star's conclusion.
Everyone involved will be able to live with that.
Beautiful animals and tasty cakes tempt the guests
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the district association's performance show this weekend in the community centre.
The judging was already done on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 organises this large exhibition.
Breeders from the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young hobby keepers from Wickede show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show will be well informed as the judging of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 pm.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. on Sunday, followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to take part in a raffle with attractive prizes and a delicious cafeteria.
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, the topic will be "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to explore the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in past centuries had known too much about this and relied on those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas today", contemporary prophetic teachings about the hopes of consummation are characterised more by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by the critique of religion," says the speaker.
It has "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "But the decisive challenge remains the nuisance of death".
Connected with this is the question of that longing "which dreams that everything may be good in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in theology in 1997, also in Freiburg.
Her habilitation in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleiner Heuberg confirm their faith at Confirmation
101 15- and 16-year-old young people from the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed in two services.
The service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si in the morning and the youth choir The Spirit in the afternoon.
By receiving the sacrament of confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, the confirmands had prepared for the great feast day under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian parish life and experienced the youth day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In glorious weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to tackle the circuit over the chains of hills around the lake.
This was reported by Ulrich Knobel of the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude difference, were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted to practise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior cyclists of the German top class also competed in this event: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placings at the German Championships.
As expected, these two were able to set themselves apart from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage until the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel came in second again.
In the women's race it was Theresa Duelli from Team Albtraum who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of riders who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of ability, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race, there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four riders were able to break away from the regional top riders.
Among them was Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, has already been world champion in twelve-hour riding twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German duathlon championship titles to his name, will also be taking part.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, the finish line in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it final.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only one second behind, the veteran Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann crossed the finish line in third place overall.
In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Second place went to Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organised running of the event.
Excellent mastery of the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea", is tailor-made for Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago when it comes to fishing.
So the two of them simply complement each other magnificently.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the back of the old man's neck that the fisher boy Manolo talks about.
When Santiago sits on the chair, weary from life, it is real with Janson.
Besides that, the role of the old fisherman is a character role through and through, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his strength of will.
For long stretches, Janson is the sole actor on stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on him, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the audience forgets that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles after all.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts each active scene in the light: Santiago's hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings about Cuba's attitude to life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm to it and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A 120-metre-long sewer from Roman times has been preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise some 157 metres into the sky, making it the second-highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, so all that remained of the remains of the old city wall was what wasn't too big.
Most users of the car park today therefore hurry past the Roman remains and just park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site in parking deck D2, separated by metal bars.
You can see ruins about five metres high made of stones the size of your hand.
"They are remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze tells us.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look down a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft on the upper level of the park.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is also hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend into the depths again.
Here we experience the official residence of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in plain German means "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinese, founded under Emperor Claudius on the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the vestibule of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of about 120 metres.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima for a bit if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze has one more surprise.
After fetching the key at the ticket office, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater that was essential for ritual ablutions.
To this day, the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, shows varying water levels due to changing water levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah will become part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, it will be several years before it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: Replay of rocker trial
A bloody attack in the biker milieu is being reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily harm and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun at the Frankfurt (Oder) Regional Court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and to have belonged to the Bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims allegedly belonged to the rival Hells Angels group.
One of them is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
The incident was apparently preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about turf wars and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesperson said at the time that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognised.
The Federal Supreme Court overturned the verdict after an appeal by the prosecution and referred it back to the Regional Court for a new trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open prison for another offence.
At the beginning of the trial, the main issue was the reconstruction of the events on the night of the crime.
The commissioner who was investigating the case at the time was called as a witness.
The focus was on the mobile phone conversations of the accused and other persons, which the police had intercepted.
What is difficult is that rockers almost always abide by a law that is ironclad for them in court - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had testified.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said when asked that new leads had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of hearings are scheduled for the trial.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it's time to go home.
Only: hunger makes itself felt in the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seats.
Sure, the one or other cocktail or champagne may be responsible for that!
What could be more natural than to drive to the next drive-in and treat yourself to a snack?
I admit, I like to be there when it's time to get fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few chips, a Coke, a burger - and then it's off home to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become apparent.
Because what must you be missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially at weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and car parks.
"Why?", I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the nearest rubbish bin?
It's not just that the paper stuff disfigures the landscape.
Bags have also covered traffic facilities such as crash barriers, causing accidents.
But the "throwaway society" doesn't think about such things, and probably doesn't even know what the word actually means.
If you are often on the road in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what the back seat can look like after a night of partying: Clothes, bottles and other rubbish pile up.
A few more or fewer bags wouldn't make any difference - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on other people's leftovers.
I can already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will get tired of cleaning up - and the fast food chains will have to charge a deposit for their bags.
Jerusalem government does not confirm attack on Syrian airbase
An American government official who wished to remain anonymous told the American news network CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Latakia, Syria, a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and associated equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanon's Hezbollah, it said, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had earlier reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on Wednesday night, blaming the Israelis.
Israel's Channel 2 television showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Neva defensive missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets, which Channel 2 said have a range of 35 kilometres and can carry warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an Israeli government official, also anonymous, as saying he believed Israel had carried out the attack but was not certain.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously tried, sometimes successfully, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would be followed by a military response.
A persistent ankle injury threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in FSV Mainz 05's Bundesliga away match at FC Augsburg.
Mainz are anxious for Nicolai Müller to play.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his top scorer with six goals with him.
The Mainz team already has to do without the injured key players Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
