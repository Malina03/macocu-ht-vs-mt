Assistants Strikes: Receivables for new labor compact measures
Deputy Assistants have called up their union to approve new labor compacts in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has challenged its entire Council to approve more labor campaign measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that there would have been Ministers to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.
Assistants and medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract in July, which was agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of its members who have voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the contract was rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC board has tailored to fully reject the proposed new contract and request official renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the Silence of the Government, the JDC Board today has made a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor compacts, which begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistants striked six times this year, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant physiciansJohann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with that the contract should be beneficial and assumed.
After the vote, the Minister of Health of Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty for Doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that finished a crisis.
The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official war of the words and economic sanctions on the end of the eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can not deny impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile looked narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.
I could not count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve.
The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have dazed as if anything bad had happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather the opposite.
But a Putin-radiating, sustainable coolness showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the launch of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow reaction at the time was pierced.
Putin shared and accused Ankara, to fall in Russia in his back.
The offense was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Building the confidence is difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media performed a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were the guilt for everything.
The most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic state.
He has denied this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excess of Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a truce are clearly obvious.
Erdogan first and foremost needs all friends he can get after he was released last month with a failed coup of his office.
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it looks at his reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.
In addition, the persistent grudge on the cross-pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is empowered to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.
The Russian head of state, in Ankara, certainly won a bonus for the fact that he demanded support for the chosen state organs after the attempted coup.
This is reasonable for Moscow a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.
The Summit in this glamorous palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as an analyst, once described to me, to represent "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the west and feel badly treated and now allow themselves.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing pages.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions, both presidents at the press conference statement that they would not even striped the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found to Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member Turkey shoots the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two head of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Board of Directors of the Bank, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan announced the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself as she had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer finances.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB References, the decentralized headquarters and the listing listing will change to Natwest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller trademarks for the private customer business, which are getting more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit to customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, since we are now becoming a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
Now I say that we do not track global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will be different in its own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that his Six Nations sponsoring will no longer continue and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in his sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop the bank of the brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?"said the executive board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago, when we said that we will be a great bench for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can restart these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3rd million profit at Newmarket on Predilection
DETTORI sprays champagne for a double at Newmarket, who brings him 3.000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3rd million British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He sat on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy to happen to Newmarket, because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the cheers when he picks up the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-color winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the ninial derby winner had 4,493 career yields
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for race, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusked fans for years for this sport.
I said Frankie a few weeks ago at EPSOM that he had already brought 6,000 profits if he was not just a weekend and big tournament Jockey!
Frankie has already rode in GB almost 30 years winners, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve wracking.
A whole series of big tournament gains, including its famous "glorious seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his twists and return to his best form.
And he is not in the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue on competitions to his at least 50.6 year.
Russia Putin fires staff leader Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was many years part of Putin's closest trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Agents.
In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin without giving reasons "the dismissal Ivanov had ordered by its obligations as chairman of Russian Presidential Administration".
Anton Vaino, who had been Deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations (Mgimo) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website of Kreml it is said (in Russian) that he later was minutes of protocol and staff head of government.
He said about his appointment to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state with regard to legislative designs and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin announced the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putins and works for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.
As a staff head he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resign at their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the episode of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official assertion - that a man who was once praised as a potential president would suddenly manage Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.
In his comments on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked her in a conversation in early 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost tell me - arbitrary items for four years.
As it turns out, I have been a chairman of Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) was replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he most familiar.
Once, it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia to Putin's second term of office, as a third term of office violates Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another, related ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president for three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson involved last month involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
On the set there was artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident, "he said in a message.
Details, like the character Gibson's character, is written out of the series following a team of FBI agents, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios are expected to be published later.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible anymore.
I would like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28th.
Mystery around fish landing in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help to identify the fish, who appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 farms could act around sandaale, which were spread from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, released a video of the spectacle on PERISCOPE in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to FIFE
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to FIFE.
It is the first of four closures of the "cover blower", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sleeve ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a beton for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering upgrading and civil engineering.
After installing the last road coverage section and the connection with the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massively, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tonnes weighed and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Hikel, as the tolerances on which the team worked on, tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck to be alive"
Three men have "luck to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat from Anglesey.
The Moelfre Rnli Rescue Station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety, while their boat moved away from his own.
"We saw the boat in your area turned around and presented us the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have blown the boat already except their range until we left to water," he added.
Two of men were saved from a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and hanging on a buoy, hanging without a rescue vest.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness unhurt and still alive.
Although the boot engine had an emergency stop, it loosened by the car's cares from the person who steered the boat.
Someone has been watching these men today.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.
That teenagers and child no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time to stare on screens, was complained by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon GO it's about bringing people from the sofa and be more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-delusion, an app based on the characters, which were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later, a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs emerged.
Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand was sinking something in early July.
The market launch in other countries has been shifted through the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players with their smartphones go outside and looking for Pokémons followed by a GPS and once they were found "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person lies back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracked 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people exercising every day 30 minutes to 53 percent to 53 percentCalling up.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it sees only the raw data for performance enhancement.
Many public reconnaissance campaigns that people want to bring "take a 30 minute time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" encountered deaf ears because many public messages are boring and from peoplecome, the misery look.
Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be overvalued.
Anyone who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances to illuminate cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead you here.
But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that people bring to do something outdoors that makes you fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game developers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What the hell?
It has occurred a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit used to track our activity as soon as possible, they did not give us a reason to do sports as this game does.
The new will lose its charm and the use will pass over time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activities in the real world, helping many people to hunt, be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenta
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
On whole line brilliant.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast directed on Thursday to the multi-rotting title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the headlight light of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result from 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raismman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles Turn on the floating beam during the individual campaptiminal of women in art gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-rating title, and overall the fifth, while it consolidates their reputation, to be the best of their generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears as her final result was shown and her long journey took an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated their sports, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - gained with such amazing exercises, which include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion of Mary Lou Retton of her said she said "the best gymnastis that I have ever seen. "
She expected a last exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would return, would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, Links, and Aly Raismman hugging after they have gained gold and silver in the single-campfighphinal women in artificial gymnastics at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell ceremony of the retirement team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation point.
Although Biles insisted on the top during her long way to have planned the future, that's not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music, which would fit at home outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's no coincidence.
This girl adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a power.
Since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a multi-coating competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as it wishes.
Even if Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was borne.
Beam bars and bodemen - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She returned again at 15.433 on the float - and with a 15,933 on the ground still put on it.
Raismman hugged her gently when she expected her Endgbnis - a pure formality - and tears poured on bands shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The achievement of Raisman was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when they fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which is called by the Americans "grandma", had a lead.
After their ground exercise, she threw the audience of kiss hands, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial conveyor case shot in music listening in the car
According to police reports, which were published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, which have been reigned in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first serial conveyor case of Phoenix, while they underhurt themselves in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police said that threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $ 2,900 that owned one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootout led the investigators to become a closer look at whether they are associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven persons were killed mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and injured two more.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," HOWARD of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, announced at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect has used multiple vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah still died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shootout, which aimed for a blank pickup truck half an hour before triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-old, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the fewest of his victims, Edmund Mikrocephalie, the result of a genetic disorder, has nothing knowing about his mother Elizabeth Picciuto during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I do not manage that.
I can not do this.
I did not get involved.
What is not true at all - of course one admitted to it, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund may never be able to recognize and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was, I did not know that people still do, '" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit nor crawl until his third year, and he still can not speak.
But he is making progress slowly.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has thought for "please sing me something before". "
"We bring him sign language," told Picciuto CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language - she says.Edmund has invented some signs alone.
Mikrocehalie has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary widely.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the Zikavirus infected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional prize of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still does not really know.
I have not asked for the prognosis for a long time because I do not expect that you can really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zikavirus.
It gets better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Violent rains, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Violent rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to exclude the emergency on Friday.It is expected all Saturday with more rainfall.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shore and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and is already on the road to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags multiplied.
Steele said that alone the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over long parts in the south of Louisianas to Saturday.
The weather service had announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood-free warning system was used on Friday, while in the area Mobile continued to rain.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record level over the weekend.
The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these are only slowly flowing into the Lake Maurepas over the occurred rivers.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached on Friday already at 09.00 the highest level ever recorded.
Rescue teams still tachled people from the flood water in the districts Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that Water of Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose overnight overnight.
He said that he would have warned him another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and streamed the water and poured in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife said Hansford that she had never seen such a river of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.

Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympiamanship in gymnastics and of more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I am with every summer oolympiad and the US have never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who looked inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raismman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, which is Catholica, makes every pride.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one was an African American under the female gymnasts.
Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiaguinnin and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the Threefold World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were unexpected, but masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold with an individual multiparting event for women.
Team member Aly Raismman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but so turn classes do not look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same way as Aly and Madison to create it to the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team.In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks so that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnases maintained by parents who are for the training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coachesand their gymnasts and families) emerge.The list can be resumed as desired.
The majority of these gym clubs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turner will receive their overall workout and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We have to enable the communities of AUN innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easier accessible gymnastics.
I founded my gymnastics of 20 years.
For my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.
This combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to interest for gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by picking up the Olympic team gold and thanks, barrel to her so many young girls with different background motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successfulYoung women become.
Assistants want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who tuned them in a choice leaned.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "no man's land" and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant physicians should receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care for trusting times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA committee for assistants shared last night in a communication with: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it is the current workforce crayon and will reserve it to meet all physicians"
For just eight weeks that still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to solve the disputes by talks encountered in the government to involve contribute and sometimes on deafening silence.
The happened of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made that last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, abuse and appeal to the worries of assistants."
If he does not do so, the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out more labor compacts.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors on the strike chain coverage.
The ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA would like a better weekend salary for the 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS employees, asked the assistant physicians to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Labor compact measures do not achieve little, but already burden over-loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient, nurses and their families only worries, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we spoke to the committees of assistants and positively responded with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns about the guardianship and whistleblowings.
Employers hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional break, training links, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the sexual wage gap in medicine -Signs were how serious it was the employer, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £ 2-per day drug, which can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2-per day drug after the authorities were recommended to administer this more people for a long period of time.
The coagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls forming coverings.
When the pad breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot solves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who had already had a heart attack, subject to a higher risk.
Ticagrelor manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots of unlikely.
The design design of Nice, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month taking of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Nice Health Technology Valuation Center said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack has another heart attack or stroke - often with Descentrosis."
The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.The guidance design does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of the Political Correctness makes election fraud inflating in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a desiring government report revealed today.
The former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles reaches verbally the police, election observers and counselors to have ignored evidence of election abuse due to "ethnicity and religion hypersensitivity".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, which is now an antcorruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up scribes outside of Electoral Cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should result in a passport to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to call his name and address.
The report suggests not to apply removable ink to the finger of a person when they give their voters to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of not official committees or working groups.
"This is not only for election fraud, but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial fraud culture, which assists with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in the East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the reigning mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had the religious feelings of his Muslim community "perverted in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should "have led his campaign on the basis that it was the relative duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation, in which a person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there were evidence in the whole country for fraud.
In particular, he expressed itself alarming for fraudulent postal voting - in the older members of the Muslim community printed pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the guidance of identity to prove the identity
In his report it says: "As proof, it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the older, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladish background.
"There was concern that ... State institutions had ignored such behavior due to" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing post-election documents to stop "elective".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registry checks to prevent the dialing from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Options consider to ask voters before the election according to your ID card.
Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Perform systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic postal vote.
Prohibition that political activists will process complete mail elections and envelopes of mail elections.
The police give the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations.
A change of law facilitates an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Popular Representative Act 1983).
Photographing ban in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters alone go into the election cabin.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets Case has not been credited.
"The Election Court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for the due to a litany to corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," he said.
He was guilty due to a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high demands in the criminal procedure.
He also criticizes the ineffective "Abhakontrollen" of the electoral registrations of the Rathauser.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country as the mother of parliaments is a pride inheritance, but the worrying and concealed spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.

Buyers in Primark outraged about woman who tried shameless underwear in the middle of business
The buyers did not know where they should look like a woman set out their clothes in the midst of a Primark to try under pants.
To worsen the situation, she studied as she looked at it, she moved out and put her back to the shelf.
They rummaged and tried four pair of underpants in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark business in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she left her and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area she took a few underpants out of the display, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried her.
"She did not even try to find a more discretionary place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as they looked out the underpants, who obviously did not like them, as they put them back to the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other underpants before finally decided that she did not like anything to go on and out.
"She did not seem to disrupt that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who may buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home, who hatched another person and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have noticed, employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman dressed her and removed again and did not wash her."

How to protect against weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to handle armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from behind you will show you how to turn the spit over for your robber.
When approaching them from the back, then they should turn around first, so they can see their attacker and "issue themselves from the weft line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before beating him with your free elbow face.
Then hit him with the knee in the groin and twist, while the attacker collapses in pain from pain, the weapon from his hands.Beat him with the barrel in the face and move backwards as they focus on him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body from the weft line, grip the weapon and twist them so that the attacker can not shoot.
At the same time relocate the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon from his handle before moving backwards and straightening the weapon.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is facing.
But remember that there is a robbery to hand over your money - if you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shook his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent his immune system and choking reflex of a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk hugged his turning on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show up and to show what he will get involved.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide To Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of licking the rinsing button of a train toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be fully repulsive, but in fact are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left, what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.
From public railings to stations up to flush buttons of toilets, the task was definitely under a sample
In the film he told, "Already as a child I was relatively uncerted, which concerns my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he was definitely fair to his reputation.
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His trial stroke showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number is freshly washed hands less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick himself after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide To Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places like the bathroom
In the movie he says, "That's the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide To Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Fehilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says, "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brainstormings that ended with that we said "Let's call us."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the movie added, "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have instructed to lick him, as the disgusting RussianToilet shown in the movie. "
Of course, there were things easier to bring Ian to tell them and others who were quite difficult.
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "
In a 2005 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, said that they at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a delogation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.

Donna Mcevoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment was no longer repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare here for the people and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons, who lived in the home in the apartment and the police said that the terror who had added the family, street fights with baseball worn, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
There were wooden floorboards in the property in which drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors said they saw them on the street struggling and the police had to be called regularly

Delogation were cheered by facilitated neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They were caring for anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we say the police here are incredible.
"This morning we could not sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now where you are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family could have been able to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years
On the overgrown side of the parish hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added, "It is a shame that the tenant arrested, any responsibility for their behavior and to accept that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step in considering Cornwall Housing.
That was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extremely and her deeds had to be terribly coexisted for her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community, who have gone brave on us and have given us the information received.
I hope that this development will donate some neighbors comfort and the message conveys that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they are all over 20.
A dirty mattress released in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
Workers of the property management will now have to clear ground mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £ 1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she owed to the possession of a Class B drug in trading intention.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who came to a car accident in 2013.
After they were without shelter, Tanya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were carved with graffiti.
The police say that they will delogate tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela Crow from Devon's police and Cornwall police announced that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not consider the house rules.
"This is about those who think they can behave without self-allegation as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminals and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic off after a lying military jet beach
Sun witter in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of her life
A Portugissehes P-3C Orion airplane of the air forces laid an incredible dive
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that no security risk
This was the moment to start panic in the frightened tourists after a delightful jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military airplane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sunbathers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably started to worry about the noise's nozzle engines without first seeing what was approached by the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said, "It flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall to me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the airplane came out of the dark and incredibly low flew
The Portuguese air forces stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew slightly deeper due to the poor visual conditions by nearby surface fires than usual, but the air forces insisted that security was at no time endangered.
Surface fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people on the island of Madeira came to death.
The Portuguese air forces stated today that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to circumstances - strong fog and fire smoke, which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
London Schoolgirl, which joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died reportedly in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned from her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the Bollwerk der Group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after leaving the war-born land and returning to England.
"One can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war area - to hold people from making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the East London rose into an airplane towards Turkey and then in a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she has married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months became the widow.

Destination plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before rushing to the comment column, to overhose him under the pseudonym of non-intelligent venomal agent age with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the many-pronounced resurgence of records is not on a boom in Millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently purchased a plate are of all likelihood of age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also no hordes through hobbybysammelers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of Yougov?
If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me, while I'm in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit wearing and gambling wildly before I stop, my hands holding and something determining legend as: "Well,Let's take a closer look at it. "
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart sohos slowly lit his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men's middle-aged) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle-aged, a woman, presumably around 20), is a day long because of oneMeetings in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I already treasise," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy objects thatHe sold when he was young and bankrupt.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I probably was too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend alone, and adds: "I do not smoke and I do not drink a lot.
That's my vice.
WeZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets to apply to the Yougov profile.
However, he also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the MediaHPE, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves to see their old records again.
Of the talks I have led, people usually got bothered in 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again, "he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that disk shops offers a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to WEZ, some of the older customers took impetus at the contactless payment system.
Some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to retreat to stability of familiar record covers, of objects, the happy janch reminders.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a blank or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says wez.
That's the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.
It is a simple way to engage in mentally.
"We are like your social workers!"Flutes an employee from a plate stack.
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who have bought a record last month, they have not yet heard.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not have a turntable.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I scroll through a stack of Bossa Nova compilation.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men's middle-aged), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone recently came in here and said," I do not own a turntable, but I would like to buy a Radihead record so that I can put them in the shelf, "he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-related, less musical.
We have people who say, "I have no turntable."
These are younger people, not older ones who get into it slowly.
FOP, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I pure.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz conduits from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity with customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but nagging mental trauma are difficult to detect if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running in the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of the plates for sale.
She is more likely to make a shop window as a great shopping.
It does not deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of plates is ... "She drives with a doubted sigh.
I do not know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to emerge the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
Nobody looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "record art".
But in view of this that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into deep soos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that emits most for luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov voices, let it disregard, at least in disk shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, disk shops and in online fores.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They do not spend their thursday tomorrow with certainty with the strolling through plate shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the staring look of an eerie, 30-year-old false moderator, who rushes over the shoulders of any middle-aged men's middle-aged men.

French court refuses offer on demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in the thousands of refugees live down.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to precipitate 72 provisional transactions in which individuals were within the camp offered by cigarettes to energy drinks, selling hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) orSell simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the designation of people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are absolutely comprehensible."
The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than feed only people who live "in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer calm meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Breaking Cross was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a communal and 200 meals a day, English and French classes and advice on asylum goods for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the warehouseoffers.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to true the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle warehouse rose to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the course of summer.
United Kingdom gets silver in the 7-he rugby after Fiji Masterclass Gold gets
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-he rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt hold at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, side stepping, backward, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - the United Kingdom fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to you in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji had beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably will not - that at least a Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
Eight years ago, you lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they lost only one.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and bounced the attacks GBS for fun.
It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on, as if you walk in moving buses.The World Series winners went up to 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau in the corner overlooked.
With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's main tackle stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but Fiji has only stopped.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua Lee a touchdown in the right corner and it is 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resource and there was still over a minute's playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou proked through more weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still there.
That's the way it is.
GB carried out basic changes at halftime and closed the Fijian gap ... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate player from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was for a long time in favor of the South Seasinulans, whose fans sang, flags pivoted and danced on the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fiji's hugged and GB kicked crossy struck into the lawn.
Previously, Fiji Japan had defeated in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scarce semi-final match from the Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach to the rowing victory
There will be no emotinal gold than games in these games and that's what I want.
From the first rowing strike to the last, 220 hard Hiev, which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two, sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat.The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was allan-responsive when she ruded for the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, which put such a scale.
Her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39th uncompleted use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers, which contribute to the incremental advances that make up the difference and it was more assistant than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day than at himCancer was diagnosed.
As he said he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and did it.
If you do not do that, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a fairly bad situation.
It changes a little outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which the interruption kept to a minimum, if under such circumstances is the correct term.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would meet.
So it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning with something more than usual to talk and tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a use in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That's something extreme, but it means so much."
It repeats just how much to me that means how much I and Helen and also robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
No one would be without Robin, so there is a massive thank you to him.He is the best trainer in the world.
I would not have a better person to train or wish a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were trapped very at the moment.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to do something great.
We did not want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I did not want to say that that was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, "she said.

Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.
With his filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already absurd to absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are impoverished, property-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misesets reach the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of propagating the app blackface to convey or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested a filter this week some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and chucky cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely used on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to be homage to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racissus reminded the filter on hurting clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison decided.
In an e-mail, Grace SavaPani, a Korean-American art student, whose Tweet were widespread on the photos that the filter "hurtful and least unpleasant was uncomfortable."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face was extremely pulled.
Snapchat is not the only company crossing this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration campaign, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - which are diverse in terms of race than their older oppers - could rather assume sensibility to expect.
If one of Snapchat's filter creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it is much harder that such things remain unnoticed when it used to be the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete your Snapchat account demanded others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that they believe that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished her attachment with a hashtag: #Deletesnapchat.
"Either she did not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positionsIn which they feel safe or feel good to say something about it. "
Other parts of your opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely unanswered.
The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of his workforce and points to his status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently set a personnel manager who focuses on under-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her that she will let her snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if you need more users like us to say that that is not O.K. is."
Military leadership distort ISIS intelligence information, sets the Committee of Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command altered intelligent information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than allowed the actual local conditions reported a Congress Investigation Committee in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the armed forces, intelligence committees and the military budget committees, reports of great dissatisfaction under Central Command intelligence agency, which reported how supervisors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Forwarding information, which were typically averted by high-ranking CENTCOM commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual site conditions and were consistently more positive than analyzes of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened to CENTCOM is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyzes are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leaders in CENTCOM range to the top top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyzes of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct indications that government tips have given under Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw pressure from their leases, an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS orIsil to draw.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command were much more positive than the facts before the congress was significantly more positive than the report.
For example, a centcom relative publicly announced that a military reconquest Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear."Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, said in a comment.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tips of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played, that analysts had to worry about manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of CENTCOM reports are in progress through the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the intelligence service committee published their own insights on Thursday, which matched some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, CENTCOM created an excessively limited process for the preparation of intelligence assessments for ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest democrat democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, known in an opinion.
This process, so Mr. ship, "delayed the publication of intelligence official reports," damaged the morality under analysts and "excessively gave little space for deviating opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they have not found any indications of an intervention of the White House at the CENTCOM analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported by investigation by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints of CENTCOM analysts.
Lt.CMDR.Patrick Evans, a press spokesman of the Pentagon, said in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress reports, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still in progress.
But he also said that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defense).
However, the allegations of the past year have raised the issue to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic state reminded of two years ago more than ten years ago, as a CENTCOM Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a document wrote about how the government under George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying forceIn Iraq, and little time to follow the consequences of 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team determines Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government's statements, air ligations against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorium, as these provisional refineries have put into operationOil on the black market for sale.
However, this realization was not published, the Times reported in September.
CENTCOMs at that time Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislative because of his excessively positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.

However, she knows however: Americans lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britishes in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group from six teams will gain the first and second place.
The first placed will go out the strong Dutch women a little longer, which lead the other group.
Whatever the game will go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 seats.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with the age of 16 she became a national player of the US, the youngest in the history of theTeams.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008 as she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which for you and your team weighing everything.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus the things began to turn to the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the workpensum in London we have now.
We have been able to tear the rudder completely.
On Thursday evening, BAM opened the scores in the first half of the game with a backhand from the near area.
India had went to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed a surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and sucked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, what time it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel resistant and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and struts.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning bar, which is served from the armbollowers to the swimmer to the Turner to triathletes.
You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen in the call of your neighbor in the queue in the coffeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there is still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, would have been quite under these well-known names that are sent to the Prime Time built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising when he has a swimmer, TurnerOr even fencer would be.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights gold in the Olympic trampoline gym.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swimming and may rule it for a long time.
But if I'm likely to make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discolored charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparingly perceived the last 16 years so that many that I had asked, I did not know that it is even an Olympic sport.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012, which made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie Maclennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clowns school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.
It has humoristic potential - the cartoon trembling of his never ever-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports, which it substantially united.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must have a series of falling movements (turn, pike and saltos) before landing on the feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated after execution, difficulty and flight time.
Twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopping must continue to go in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the destination, sometimes back and forth, upwards and down on the playground.
They do not just hunt the finish line or the outgoing wall, but in television transfer also another caval destination: those of the world or the Olympic Cord.
The targeted pursuit is Nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel so tiring even when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no buckle in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is so zen like the competition in the Olympics can only be.
The qualifications and end parties of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time;The men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will radiate the finals as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is generally overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the Angafen and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner loudly suggested the Wall Street Journal - then awaits Mr. Dooley his after air ringing, new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia, encountered violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at firefights.
Is Ethiopia just collapse?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government shaken the country and widened in more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses said that policemen shot and killed on tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Current videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or earlier of this year, as security people are showing young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist drives beyond the region, especially in Somalia.Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led by the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central ethiopia.
The entire youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from ground use to the stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.
After a sparingly criticized election last year, the ruling party and allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the voltages rise along the border to Eritrea;A fight for this poached, controversial line demanded hundreds of life in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogades, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could use the turbulence and armed themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of the look at it under the surface now.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years was very many Ethiopians able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered in such protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the oromos and amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The oromos and amharas are not natural enemies.
Since ions have been prospered by Amharas, which are predominantly Christian highlands, in political and economics, as they yielded the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are about coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many amharas and oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which make up about 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel manager, was until his death in a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and use special representative to work opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Anthiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the TIGRAY-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to be botched by the government according to analysis and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in recent months and that time of riots went over relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.
And she accepts a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesting engaged in Gondar, an Amharian city, Tigray guided shops and the hatred of Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.
Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge hike."
Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy on Friday, which surrounds his campaign by saying that his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic state, not seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential Candidate of Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his colleagues who strive to take him into protection during an eventful phase, to explain to the peculiar position, statements he could not have meant.
After making the hint of a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruded in relation to the assertion on Thursday, and in interviews insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said, he was simply sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the allegation completely seriously.
When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump, to avoid the statement slightly by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The final storm of criticism prokels on Mr. Trump, while trying to focus on the focus of his campaign due to falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Report over Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he moved heavily criticism when he said that the Russians should chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said "Of course I said the sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then rowing back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans, as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." Said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who theLanguage of both candidates observed.
But I believe, too, he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even caustic sound, as its survey values have declined further.
A new Survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a lead with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.
But while he is increasingly in focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow combatants into the uncomfortable situation, standing to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's prominent response professionals, gave rise to the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that in front of Obama Isis was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backbags, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he signed the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, served in Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister, it allowed Isis to extend himself by taking it to bring the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them to put around on each of his words and be biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "they can not!".
Some of the Democrats spotted over Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the Presidential Office.
Once for the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, in which one could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Laden Front was displaced.
The SOAP Cherie business, the verb replaced in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentralized city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can not believe that CBGB Tot, the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop."
But when New York is change, then it is also reconnected.
A revived verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good too.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.
He began to work in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishments like capers and sauteed onions.
There are natural fruit bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady electricity on old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was pulled to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was the coffee and culture in the verb, which I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day instead of its usual ICED Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another longtime and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about that the soap business has taken the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the SOAP Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we'll go to your offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he's going to expose them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juicelocal wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the Café closed.
When the new café opened, Witt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a homecoming felt.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his climb to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de Foie Gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup.
His menu on this day was something more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "it was also a message to the Americans, as they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes Last book "Chop Suey" traded from Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegerman in her book "97 Orchard" told about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest cooperation, "a decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, frills in the Flatiron District, which has been in the business since the 1929 Stocking Crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture ate.
As the reporter ordered hack roast, this was the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of great depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and a bit cheap, which stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating as many peanuts that you serve you as a dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War."A Square Meal" records the ways to deal with which the country did not avoid being the country of laugh.
"It was a time when eating for the Americans became a central, tense topic," COE was why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was the same as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became for staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of recycling food remnants," realized Ziegerman, as chefs could hide unappetitic ingredients under a crumky sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, the center of American cuisine for years, was became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried as a calorie-rich and nutrient satisfaction has priority with taste or even healthy kitchen.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegerman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the midday," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or since then, household industries - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, drives between 1923 to 1943 - the food habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to "household politicians" and the challenge to transform Pampe such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
In particular, tasty reports are the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's leave-me-cake food attitude.
As he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his cuisine, he drew like the milliwoman man from the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce," said CoE.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a magnificent reality question.
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to take a specimen with his stomach.
As described in the book, the retaining of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led that the white house produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate. "
Many of the species from the era of great depression, to deal with food, was discarded as soon as the country came back to her legs.
The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple gave on when writing the book the eating habits of Ziegelmans's mother-in-law - for example, how they could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of waste of food," said CoE.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and CoE emerged a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert, the President Roosevelt at lunch at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," Ziegerman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe brought a look at a look.
Like a CAN do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "a few chopped walnuts would help."
Gilead receives legal expenses from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by the Hepatits C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $ 200 million injury to the injury of two patents of Merck, which was related to the blockbuster drugs Sofaldi and Harvoni by Gilead after a US judge a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, includingof the meaning and other unethical acts, revealed.
Upon elevation of the action on Thursday, US officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to adopt the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to be the same with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case is back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property about laboratory work, to which Sofosbuvir underground, the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead.
Troops supported by the US say that they have recaptured complete control over Manbij from the Islamic state
Troops supported by the US have recaptured complete control over the northern city Manbij near the Turkish border after leaving the last IS fighters in the city, a group of group said on Friday.
The democratic powers of Syria (DKS) combines after the excerpt of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city, currently the city.
They have exempted over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as hostages shared Sharvan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council's Military Council allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we just do cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton has published its tax return on Friday for 2015, resulting in the presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD donated 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation;The former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in Redeboraren;The former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for their book on their term of office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice Presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton publish his tax returns of the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continues to set standards in terms of financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and reversals relating to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of Democrats.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trump's special consultant, to CNN said that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax audits are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican Presidential Candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal issues questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business developments and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already fallen to the topic and published on Friday a video on the internet, in the High Ranging Republican Trump requesting to publish his tax return.
On Thursday they also spoke the topic during a speech to the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do that what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns."she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little taxes for two years for two years, and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday, the information that this could still be the case.
Bundes taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and Investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons earn more than $ 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here, to discuss Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also undergone a tax audit of the IRS and Trump has "fear" in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax return until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40.5%.
The tax return of the CLINTONS of 2015 showed that this only uses USD 100 of its income as a reward, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and income taxed by USD 109,000.

Condoms with chillipuders, firecrackers promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Natural guards in Tanzania use a unorthodox species to hold elephants from going in houses inhabited by people - they throw condoms filled with chillipuders.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had already been the idea ago, has intensified its promotion together with US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, a non-violent four-stage method for protecting their homes andTo use harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is world elephant day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the ... Toolkit, we were able to observe a change of their attitude within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can hold the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," the managing director expressed themselvesFrom Honeyguide Damian Bell in a message.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and bubbles into a horn.
If he is not quenched, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chilipuders mixed with earth together with a firecrack body is packed in a condom, the end of which is rotated to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chillipuders in the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last option is a thrower that shoots a golden rain firework in the air while causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director devastates Berlin Hotel, because Israeli area code was removed after "Arabic" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media excerpt after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed to Israeli area code, as there were "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" made his anger in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country's prescription list of the hotel.
The country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own Call Center.
Looking for a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure is a "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason that was behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demands that the area code is deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "big shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really shameful.
The fact that this has gained itself in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame.
Neither explanation needs.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the officer.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some assumed the Kempinski Hotel that it would have given the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Shame," said it was in another post pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, stands near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly alleged all allegations and called the incident "provided" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reports the mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel not to record in the speed election list, "Quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police sets tear gas & rubber poses against protesting Brazilian students
Students collided with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police put tear gas and rubber posse against the demonstrators.
The difficulties started as a police officer tried to spend the students apart, which led to the police used rubber poses and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their disruption over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were saw graffitit against the provisional President Michel Temer to spray walls.
The most recent protests occurred for a few days after demonstrators in masses on the roads to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, which had been relieved by a vote of the Senate to their dismissal from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, the interest in the pages of Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country, said the ambassador.
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade recovery was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation made around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries, which concerns the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken from last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes that it will change.
"Personally, I can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brit Gold gains gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner Rast last night in the Men's Team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow entered the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had suited.The young pound made the legend proudly as he stormed home to sow a victory from the favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy brought the fifth of six Olympiagol medals.
She repeated the trick after being in March at the Railway World Championships in London, despite the resignation of Hoys, brought only a modest sixth place.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the manager Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hinde showed.
Hoys Retirement produced a gap that tries Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried.
Skinner was the man at which they stayed as she saw potential in the Scots, which has unfolded now.
Hindes, Kenny - The four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner put an Olympic corporation in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard ranks won the New Zealanders in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation in which Hinde drove in a higher gear to slow down it and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympic Cord in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just amazing.
There is no better way to win this.
After Triumph 2012 on the side of Kennies and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he was purposely fell on the track after a weak start.
He moved back this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.
With such a victory victory, this time there was no such problem.
Hindes said, "It feels with all the GB flags on the grandstand like London."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We have come away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that will expect us to be successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the Form Kennys it is in the area of the possible that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was also born on the day) - a yieldof six gold medals and a silver medal mean.
That's the same from Hoy.
Kenny takes part in the sprint next, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four-kilometer races.
They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the destination.
The world record that won in 2012 in London gold was 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competit, where Wiggin will certainly be in focus.
He had quarreled yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.
In the appropriate women's competition, the tomorrow continues and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations and retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like that as if the now legendary call GBS, which has reached the perfect moment, be repeated again.
Future of the melting of Portland due to the repeal of the energy contract in question
The future of the aluminum melt by Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers of workers - are at the game, as the plant operator cancel the energy supply agreement and thus cancel all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year to give no further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the system of Alcoa in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs -Direct as well as indirect - could be at a closure endangered.
In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of total electricity generation Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa castle the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the quantity of electricity for the plant.
EGL, which supplies the large aluminum melting shop with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it assumes that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The complex is in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company Citic and the Japanese Marubeni Corp keep smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," said the company.
ALT continues to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions", which should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on revenue on the EGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale trip prices.
AGL announced that it has already written down the value of the treaties in his annual financial statements of $ 187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to exclude the contracts, the "Ability AlcoaS ... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" "not affecting".
The US company said that it completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still a statement, why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the TomaGo facility near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
With regard to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts each year.
If both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as a power generator, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and Fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner Clan's Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, which is a brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the kardashians similar?), Criptified reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle's most popular showbiz uncle andProducers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliche placement almost every birthday episode of a child's program (Seafest brought the sentence, "you thought that we forgot you?," With the honesty of a cartoon on a transceiver at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow her other girlsTo participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, certainly a new era of Kardashians has begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes her what the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league for itself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With a circumference, which is more like a picture band than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzers 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of its covers will expect so longing that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still prior to the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebrities, the models" as "models that are celebrities are" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had honored.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner - the magazine described by the magazine as the "breakdown model" of its generation - falls below the former category, is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to rotate a good snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who are characterized by the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenners succeeds not everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenners was always a bit tense in the fashion world.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the vestions of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again as the message came out with the appearing Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But putting around on the misspens seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for their primer of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells from her pictures made by Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine Love.
And in your free time she is visible in the Reality TV.Presumably only to see your sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal council centers have 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the auxiliaries of the country are rejected annually by the municipal law centers, while the industry focuses on the impact of other medium cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, captive workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogications and the like - dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already excessively busy, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is envisaged that these law centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the community rights centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the national association of municipal law centers revealed that already thousands of people are rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation without a lifting of the Federal Government decision would only become worse.
"Queensland's municipal council centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services they need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressing debts, families who go through separations, workers who were unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems legal species and this survey shows that they can not get the help they can getrequire.
The Federal Government will reduce the funds from June 2017 by 30 percent, which means that thousands of hilly people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal issues without any help.
We demand the General Federal Agency and Federal Minister of Justice as well as senators from Queensland George Brandis to improve these medium cuts immediately, so people can get the help they need for legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of municipal council centers and their client communities, as well as that the government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump Election campaign charged after employees allegedly weapons
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after being communicated that your Campaign Leader for North Carolina focused on an employee in February, while in February in a Jeep.
The incident will be described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini announced that they have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the race in Vincents Kneekehle," Gave Bordini in his indictment.
After complying with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to taste damage," Gave Bordini.
The indictment only comes two days after the Republican Presidential Candidate triggered a turmoil when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and weapons friends should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges appointed.
Trump's campaign realized that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not attack violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's Press-Specher Hope Hicks was not available for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip as well.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer employee of the campaign.

The Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has hitherto led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v.Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
England must direct the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the largest attraction Heathrows, as well as in 2012 in London, when we operated a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And that will reach again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships alone, create 40,000 new jobs and to end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as she was ahead of us in London 2012, it will give those who will think that the challenge of extension Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blam on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211 billion on living growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport as well as throughout GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years as a result to the world's best airport terminal, up to the T2 built in the world's two most frequent catwalks in the worldwould.
Now you are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £ 16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we direct this Olympic mind and expand Heathrow as well as securing our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment, can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Cat and Mouse Game" regarding Ad Blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers try to bypass adblocking, a "cat and mouse game" the same.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display coverings on his desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post, where it informed that users could update their filters in the program to re-block new social network advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding regarding its advertisements to recognize it to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is more difficult to recognize.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesman wrote that "this kind of hand-and-making struggle between the display-blocking open source community and the wrestling has been in progress since the invention of display blocks in progress," and that it is possible that it is possibleFacebook soon comes with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company has embarked on social media in the battle is a strong indication of how worrying to become the industry for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study of last year of Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people's display bolifiers;Almost four times so much 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Facebooks.
The company has on display blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile advertising blockers have no effect on Facebooks Mobile App for the Social Network and Instagram, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so Facebook appears the investment of such a step as a worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "Ad Preferency Tool" to have more control over the people based on them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a spokesman for Facebook in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a dull medium, which is why we focused on developer tools like AD prereces to put more control into the hands of people.
Woman passing over at probable suicide on Swiss highway
The victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway.
The police call up witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was run over on a highway suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman put in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, which was done by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on site.
Several drivers were already heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who asked them as well as any witness of the incident to report.
A preliminary investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter announced the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not at responsibility.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman of negligent killing was acquitted, after leaving a man and killed, which lay in August 2014 a night on the A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old sacrifice had drunk and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court realized that the policewoman - who had responded to an emergency call - drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation", said the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Klimamodell: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model has been designed to determine if the Venus might have rejected earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously mentioned that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless turned slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas as de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected against faster evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent of Matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," Giss scientist Anthony del Genio explained in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees coolers than those of the earth today.
The model brought out a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected of planet researchers.
Although she was once presumably habitable, Venus was exposed to many heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen ember remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to a low co-determination in the decision's decision-making process.
Alternative President / General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will be looking for a new trainer immediately.
"In the last three years, I fulfilled my duties as head coaches and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," the 50-year-old Roy expressed himself in an opinion.
I have been thinking for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, this needed and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization.
He also has to have a co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adam's Awards as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the latest season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second wildcard spot in Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North seekers take on conversations again, put strike
The work struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea Oileworkers will be suspended, while all the entrepreneuries for a new round of discussion set the table, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the processing process of the current dispute," says in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, starting early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in more than 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates to his contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market printing this year.
The installment reduction of the company follows a 10-percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts gives the company to the required room to come through the market exhaust.
Shell has released for his part thousands of people and announced plans to raise his oil and gas work in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its megaz collection with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had strengthened by the decision of British in June, the European Union.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that occurred since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $ 1.4 billion expenditure on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion expected in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotary rates under the stars of the star cluster of the plejades.
The new data helps to understand the astronomers why stars rotate in the stars in different rates as well as in what context the rotational periods are with planetary development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the crowd of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center inPasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the plejades is located 445 light-years from the earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which originated about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are now most fastest.
For peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, his rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star stain - such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotary rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slowly than less massive stars.
Red Bull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of slower pirouettes turning than smaller.
"In the" Ballet "of the plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the pleiadades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotary rates.
"The Star Pile of the Pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Red Bull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the plejaden's rotary rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
