Civil Right Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.
"The Naacp Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to come into force until 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and let out the extreme cautionSet of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently been found in the entire state and noticed here, "says the opinion of the group.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it serious power to gain discrimination laws, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the State, which aimed disproportionately on minorities, prompted the group to give out the travel warning, said the Naacp.
"They have violations of civil rights that pass people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "said the president of the Missouri Naacp, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist passes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline during the journey through the state and was taken from the police of Missouri, without being accused of being criminal.
The Council also points to a recent report of the Official General Official of Missouri, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready to bring security deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI Hate Crimping Program, which classes the state in relation to the number of injuries in the country's 16th rank.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws, which oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration surveys, which, in the opinion of the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually exhibited by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the USA.
Is nothing more holy?
Now the white house of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when you start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have liked him when he had done it.
But he reached their meaning, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
When Miller Acosta scanted, "I do not want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem on which they relate later added and is not part of the original statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it myself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary response to the clinging words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any ancient immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your arms, / your harassed crowds that yearning long,To breathe free, / the miserable drop in your rich coasts. "
There was never a time in which the "misery waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict for the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly polish act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical figure.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives himself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The Great Knowal Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty Nobody invite, but rather an early neoconservative, which bring the American flame into the surrounded world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.
She is said to wear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh came to something quite unusual.
The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen from the exhausted, misery, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Your statue speaks to you the words of hope and welcome you need to hear.
And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Her torch is not supposed to lighten the way, but ignite the hatred of her sole source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Team of Great Britain
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The power director of the United Kingdom of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup Cader "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "Scotland develops something special" and the United Kingdom's Athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue to find out until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what you did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "
Several Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are approaching Sir Mo Farah at the 5,000 meter route, while Elidh Doyle was elected by the team captain team.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought completely natural, were great. "
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth World Championships in the 400 m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland so far the best total number of athletes at the World Cup were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-distance runner Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another Scot, which one should watch after a great season that included the victory with the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships, when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" on the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals will mix.
"To be the special thing about Team Captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates have voted for me and have chosen meIt's something very special for me, "she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What concerns my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics about Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you can not tolerate the integration of voters
The father of our country knew something of a bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic policy to his political principles.
He scolded in criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we will led like the sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The rod of the governor dismissed the action as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it is especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary remedy to connect with his voters and to make his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by employees who are paid by public tax dollars.
In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.
The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, MD., Was not hateful, but she asked for hate crime.
"I moored that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crime and other current news," she wrote in the commentary of the news program "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people is coming to the same topic, they will be disregarded by some more than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governors of the governor called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "for language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past time when you have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials and to arrest and to silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official criticizing that he has spent Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That should not be that hard.
At the time of Washington's time of affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writebacks hit his lead.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, overwhelmed its office, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence her.
Speech, disagreement and discourse belong to the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the final round in Archerfield last year, before he lost to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEOS Jerry Sarvadi.

He is a eager advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great shop window for this course. "
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"That really feels especially," said the Southport-based players.
"I could not defend the Extremadura Open, as they were taken from the program a year after I won them.
Back to this part of the world to come is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, last year to win here.
It was a really special time and one that we always appreciate. "
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more if you play at home," Orr said, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how the time has gone. "
With the trio in the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
It rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually sets a sweet potato - locally called "Nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and devoured.
Degei sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, z.B. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp to wash.
A bucket in a roofless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's wives, they were not assigned to their fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around in the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 oldest should vote by a public change in front of the occupation troops.
An existing movement that rebuilt for the independence against the Dutch rule turned quickly against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guineeas comprised the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so remote as it is Öde.The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.
There are no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and well-plate roofs, which were converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let go journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan's worshiped a God called Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her lively, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst nursery and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
An investigation of 2005 in New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly $ 20 million, including up to $ 150,000 of a single officer.
Papuanian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained since 1969 by Indonesian military.
Massing offices in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were used as genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" in a report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric succession are particularly popular after another report - and the brutalCuddition of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as any week's incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing, as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese awareness canteen sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the local Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities during his election campaign in 2014 and to tackle the infringements in Papua.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that the righteousness is restored," says YOU.
In fact, Paniai only suffered a low point two months to Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, as two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took impetus at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yimo, was struck so hard that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military commander center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting sheets and led the Waitan dance - in circle running and a birdwood imitating - from Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started stones on police and military items to spin.
When the mood was heated, the soldier was sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses make more than three times resistance, shoot them dead," says Time's official document that has not been released from the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home.
Nobody was to listen in the mood.
"When I turned around, I suddenly shot my left wrist," he said Time on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shooting was.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who bears a name of how many Indonesians, the time in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
The boss inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted their station only "secure" because they were attacked.
"We have to defend us when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman for the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more hurt.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta until the following day.
Three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000 years.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed through, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a decline when he talked to Time on June 5 in Jakarta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, which the UN has accused of "crimes against humanity", which demanded more than 1,000 deaths victims in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victim took over such allegations with grim disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I am tired."
He says he still lives for years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, are afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital, a person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished at a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's office office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by fighting warning shots.
But locals say that the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian Paramilitary Police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panic, we're afraid that revenge will give revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnesses, as the injured people were delivered here quickly, so the Time.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament called to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area.
Paniai has always been a reminder for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani and then, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claimed to defend the rights of the Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top opm leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and was arbitrarily taken in custody, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never dive back.
Among the people of Papua Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as much reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially notals and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They reserve the majority of the harvest for the family while selling the rest on the local market.
Ten Pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport in larger numbers.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to keep your own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Base Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission was given to filming.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's promises became election campaign to repeal the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to tell of Indonesia's restless eastful provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors Papuas.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread injuries" in Papua, including Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want to take note of more foreign governments.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke her silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source, which also participated in the meeting,But want to stay anonymous.
In 2019 Indonesia has another presidential election, but the Papua says that you probably will not be right back to Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" he needs to repay.
"You do not need money, you just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai weft showed a last symbolic act of defiance of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station.
You know that you may never receive justice, but at least let the people do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers from Dubai for the second time
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 337 meter high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that fails through the skyscraper in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Torch Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "a resident told his name as George, Reuters.
Dubais Civil Protection Authorities said that the units of fire fighting at around 4:00 pm local time (00.00 o'clock GMT) deleted the fire and cooled the building.
The government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch Building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the disguise, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation came.
In the United Kingdom, the police said they believe that the system of plates for isolation and paneling at the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June, in which about 80 people died.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers brings forbidden items to the plane, finds a survey
A survey under passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously prohibited objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration pasted, including at least 6 percent, which entered the plane while accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered delayed that they were mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents, the encouragement that she knowingly attempted to fly with something banned by the TSA were 19.7 percent Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, the members of the generation X were.
The most common objects that were deliberately past TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 percent gave too, knowingly supported objects with sound through security control, while 2.2 percent of female surveyed surveyed and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they intentionally brought forbidden drugs into the airplane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many were deliberately done.
It is no surprise that people who most likely smuggle - knowingly or unknowingly wear through safety, those who were most common.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain which fluids may take them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of objects banned by the TSA are forbidden fluids.
For a while, the people thought the TSA could watch books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA boss Pruitt is backwards because of the delays of the rules of Obama-ERA to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt took the head of the environmental protection authority, his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions Smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities against more responsive than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been collected against his previous body in a federal contract court.
It is about a deadline that started on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for land-near ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay adherence to one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid, "to interfere in local decisions or to hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection legislation for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly translated or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resign.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Prues Regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal Convention Court has decided in Washington that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround at ozonestandards simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.
"Under former administrations, the EPA often did not comply with the deadlines for the implementation and then waited to be charged with activist groups and others, and to set the date for the implementation," said Pruitt, who more than a dozen the EPATemplate in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation by lawsuit, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that gives us, serious. "
Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that Pruise will eventually use his "authority of delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress urge a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure was not yet placed in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states, who had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our actions - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog, which flows into their communities," saidSchneiderman.
New York closed California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting SMOG can cause serious respiratory problems with sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered surprising course change via Pruitte.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible person for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd by the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We need to continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, to be applicable to environmental polluter and their special interests".
Trump put after leaked transcripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump demanded in a call with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop, publicly tell that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President climbed him because he had spent the wall publicly denounced.According to reports, he said to him, "You can not tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and Schwor to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia to take over "ridiculous", "Mies" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade, which was conveyed by the Government Obamato make him look like a "Depp" after he had proposed a ban on refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "That's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford massacre: activists lead racist lynchakt as call for justice
A 1948-Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, rumping on the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with rifles to block his way.
The leader of the MOBS - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked testing through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants floated in fear.
"We want this N ---- R Roger!"The man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams torn the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a look.
But if a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience came out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to the Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946 were gently.
Nobody was ever charged because of the murders.
"It is really incomprehensible that there was no single person in all these years - although we see them in our communities, though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the adjustment.
"It's a stain of stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists.
For him, the adjustment serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong was never corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the termination, we want healing, we want to reconcile, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We can not get healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A trial creates a scary over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynche on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynce process.
But nobody has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been free foot for decades, civic lawyers say that twice the motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote on the race campaign in the summer.
Approximately at the same time as the election statch according to the FBI of the black farm tailor Roger Malcom a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor was in the city that Hester with Malcom's Ms. Dorothy slept and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison paid, a prominent white landowner, $ 600 to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her Cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when she removed from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, Harrison, who has prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a complant between state and local law enforcement, which was involved not only to the murder, eliminated evidence and has the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it even more concisely.
"It was an optional massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community:" If they register and if they vote, then they will pass them here. "
Almost a decade, Cassandra Greene headed the annual reorganization of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their representation is clear, moving and is based in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We do not want to talk about the lynch, because we are confronted with his ugliness in us all," she said.
"But I can not build any relation to you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I've been through".
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of blacks - in a room and listened to, when Greene started a well-built overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director.
He has played the role of the boss clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that way," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to live this story alive because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, the Hester is going on and pressing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona replies the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone breaks out (at least all black actors) in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alerted and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still chuckling.
"I just do not believe that white people have said 'n --- he'."
"Yes," one of the other black performers joked.
"You just have to be the hard 'R.'meeting."
And that's where the energy moves in the room, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holidays Mourning Librede "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it wipes a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of sight.
The audience is almost uniformly divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, arrived to see the performance, many come down only the road.
They have experienced all almost eight hours of Georgia's pushing moisture when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombstones of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, if one stands in the same country where the lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last grades of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpse.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"They are not really dead," a little boy mumbles as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit, who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that is not in your heart.
You did that for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple chatted from Atlanta excited about the adjustment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words which feel the performance has left.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like they themselves and do that because they look like you," she said.
"What really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "today this is called only police shootout."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps his table, he eats and recalls the civil rights.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"The adjustment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like that if we do not learn anything about it, then it can happen again.
Who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them. "

The British education group Pearson said on Friday, you will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut your intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program is started to overcome the pressure that faces the company.
The job reduction, the Director-General John Fallon promoted predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, in addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were lost.
Pearson announced in a third-party cost-cutting program in a third-party cost-cutting program for a cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ($ 394 million) in order to revive a business that has been hit by the fast step towards digital learning.

Convoy attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed at suicide stop
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of NATO and hurt several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter had been injured, announced a statement of NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO opinion, it is said that the explosion was done on Thursday night, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "persisted by persons".
The statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the airfield Bagram.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite District of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On May 31, a tremendous bombardment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack of the country, since the US-run troops in 2001 repressed the Taliban of power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump woves to increase the number of US troops that support military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that suicide mattes in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government in recent weeks, their policies, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA returns decision to delay the smog rule after complaints
The US Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama's government, aftermanship, after which states are committed to curbing the smog-causing emissions.This took place a day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step.
The EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to promote the so-called "ozone provisions in 2015", and said she show the commitment of the agency to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and because we react to our state partners," said EPA boss Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA, the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a portion of the country should be determined where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018to delay.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, was complaining on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried a wide range of environmental requirements, which has imposed the former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda, which according to Trump should boost economic growth.
However, efforts have raised the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air containing ozone "reducing lung function and strengthen breath symptoms" such as asthma.

Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, which should be in a collision course, to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met on Thursday for the first time.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, the hallway went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-divisional world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list.

When the couple posed for photos, Lomacheko Manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I am a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I rose for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.

I am more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
New results of the Swedish asylum age valuation tests released
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years.But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun performing the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are intended to make the assessment of the old age after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Violence) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees, which were minor.
To date, Migrationverket 6.880 has sent cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are resistant to the past few months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied to his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 these cases the person openly said that they will be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which made X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually through puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can not surely say it, we should not do that as if we could do it, "he said the newspaper metro.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of erroneous to judge a child than adults is low.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent. "
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
.The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening with a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed from me, "Governor said Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many and to tell you a lot of thought ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can not help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," JUSTICE added.
"As a coach, I would say that it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he has coalins in five states, and inherited from his father a coal business.
He is worth about $ 1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, in which it said: "The change of Party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us than to work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party, which is without guidance from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, incident message,"The RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement the CBS News.
CoE praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The worldwide boss of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, which he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be backed up in the sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships, that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said it's sorry for "all athletes who were struggled in competitions gold and silver medals."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the prohibition, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency report (WADA) reported references to state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said Iaaf President Coe the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with himself that they have experienced some pretty hot times and everything will do to make sure the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accept the criteria for his reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," said COE.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system, "he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral actors at the Athletics World Championships, who are starting on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to fulfill some of the criteria for reading.
Drugest tests are still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still freely active, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris
The rules that aim to prevent unhindered issues of the European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the senior organization that the European game has supervised the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must sometimes prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.
Barcelona paid $ 222 million ($ 262 million) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must be counterpart with legitimate sources of revenue that allow you the break-even point in your football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin when banks or owners retreated their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from the concentration to the debts of clubs on the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, Clubs may accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell from the Presidency in disgrace in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Cefer continues to be committed to climbing excessive issues.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will intensify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee can be reported for the next five years of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $ 82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season to 21 players instead of theOtherwise normal 25 players remains limited.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outline their financial supervision by inflating their revenue through companies that are associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatar company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market records, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsoring was bloated from the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments at Neymar could come across payments from the WM 2022 Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WM ambassadors will become and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could easily find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to pay attention to any attempt to bypass the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, says Thursday's people who are familiar with the situation.
They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were united with discussing the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars away, claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily as in terms of Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports Tycoons, shares the reservations from La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country. "
Nostalgia goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-grunge-era (as the David Wain and Michael Showhalter David, the Sketch Comedy "The State" for MTV turned), And for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd took larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time was scarce.
"First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening on the core of the GAGS - playing a middle-aged actor, horny children who grow up - they still made the impossibility to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the casting cancellation principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90-he's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"("The hand rocking the cradle").
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple PowerBook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The gracious Coop (Mr. Showhalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost its virginity.
And there is another crazy-maligned plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showhalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-suited impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excurses are the best part of the franchise.
It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, showing Matt Dillon's lower lip of "singles" whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could effect this franchise as a kind of repetitive "seven up!"Series until he reaches what I consider as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene the gang will show how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", to the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even on "Glow" with his east-counter-west ring combat iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, for truth, atheism and theWay of Marxism Leninism fight.
The main roles - a hard setched Gregor and an idealistic IOSEF - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend the time to watch chess on television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous spokesmers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it pulls you, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited at a lower length, could provide its AGITPROP satire better, as Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a pile of hamburger.
The embassy for the imagined communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything to feed for a job.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with yours.
The Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation on an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when she maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforcing pressure.
The Political Decisions of the Bank Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members with a rise in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In her quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation in autumn expected to rise to just under 3% in autumnshould.
But they signaled that interest rate increases would be necessary in the next few years to curb the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that the credit costs may need to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth business package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate said the bank: "In the central prognosis of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on households' real income continues to burden consumption."
The interest rates repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "a little greater" extent than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank's growth forecasts corrected for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% forecast compared to the 1.9% forecast.
It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell for these messages to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to no change occurs after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations on an interest rate increase and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easily recovered after the bank towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as tightening becomes worse first before it will improve.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy could not "prevent" income breaking ", but she added that wages will recover" clearly "at the end of their three-year prognosis.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after reducing interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU coordination, which caused the sinking of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years until the prices and the economy will complete.
Before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates, the call has risen after an interest rate increase, since inflation increased pressure on hard-to-tighter households, with three political decision-makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said this was expected and will appeal again in the coming months.
The bank told the overrun in relation to their goal of 2% is "completely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said, "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive, as the lenders want to look loud after stores and want to stop the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly well for those where the existing deals leak and complete the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (national health service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the high court against the financing of the medicament in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sex prophylaxis (PREP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service for a first three-year study for 10,000 people.
He explained to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the power to pay for the prep despite the assertion that the local authorities should finance him.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first, which will allow the registration of people, and more clinics will follow in October before being introduced in April 2018 throughout England.
Preexposition prophylaxis (PreP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that Prep reduces the HIV transmission in case of infection at infection.
Prep before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
To those who are suitable for treatment include gays or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who were not treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgers and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The study should judge the entire potential of Prep by collecting clinical evidence, as used in a large scale, is used, recorded and implemented.
Stevens said, "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress more than three decades of progress in managing one of the largest health challenges of humanity. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is targeted to needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not with a negotiation with a partner is subject to improving many, many peopleleads.
We welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said, "The priority must now be on the fact that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV has left behind.
Now that the PREP test medicine was procured, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister of Health, said, "The beginning of the prep-process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can terminate the transfer of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will help to end the distribution of HIV in society a step closercome'.
The big life live: Zinzstag and Clever Designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold your bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high blankets.
I fell in love with you and made an offer on this day. "
Since the first sightseeing, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom estate with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Janne wanted to add storage space and an alley to use the generous ceiling height optimally.
"I wanted to cover high, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet of high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.
The blanket was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge insisted to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the specification.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without we had to bend.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but to put on the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down. "
This arrangement made it easier to place two spaces in full - with plenty of drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theater, room and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering art came in," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterest, so it will glide very easily when you push up the door."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here you have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things they touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You do not fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and sized square meters of some standard in something very amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate emigration
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate emigration Victoria worth more than $ 500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin de Lutis lives in a villa in Torak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul.This has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how your property and business assets should be split.
Paul since 2014 wanted to retire from family business, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Ltis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
After an agreement with its deceased father, Colin has described by Paul as a "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Ltis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns the value of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem point for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed funds.
The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims he excluded him.
Colin argues, this is not true, but paul prefers to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to commit the dispute.
"My Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Ltis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my recent years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna de Ltis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her ownership to her sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the DE LITIS group of companies, with Colin claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, so says Paul "became embittered about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has held back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 from Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media picked up with Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can not say much," because the case is in front of the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to pull our surname through the dishes," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.
"Our father did not want Paul and I would end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hope for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new staff leader plans to restrict the media abstinence of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first one.
Politico reports that the White House's New Staff Chief is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As John F. Kelly, the New White House Staff Chief, together with senior staff at his first working day, made a major problem in President Donald Trump's white house he repaired: Bad information that advises the president's hands.
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in Briefings - because the President would make better decisions when he would receive good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television ranges decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Kandidat Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places that were to be convinced," said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep TRUMPS Twitter's habit under control, according to six former campaign officials is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
OK.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter's habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we do not know - that Trump's Tweets did not include even more ignition without their interventions.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff made him a few times to keep trouble away from him, then their efforts were worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented it to prevent Trump's controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house, which composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump's material that possibly promotes their views from the world.
Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May on the prehilting of the consultants to provide the president of strategic reasons doubtful information.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cutouts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he stiffens to find out where they come from.
Exactly that happened at the end of February, as someone maliciously posted a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Staff Chief Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pilefrom leaks "to be in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter due to harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then staff chief Reence Prieffus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the Trump receives".
How did that work?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same.
Maybe he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Prieffus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unalterable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Travelers negotiate over a ditch and return to 'Millionaire series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travelers on war footed, which negotiated a trench drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their men's buildings.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire series".
They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May without detached by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their ideas.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They were pulled there on Monday evening after being forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they have thrown stones on passers-by.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement them, as it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved away and are now back.
More came last night, probably even more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax when the Council can not even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be looted by another lap.
The numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area. "
A spokeswoman of Solihull said, "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we submit our case. "
Italy tightens the sound to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs, the lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not consider new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how to continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin Tageszeitung La Stamppa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organization 'youth' youth, because their team had worked effectively with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. So we are very sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement of social media.
"We can first judge all allegations currently collected after we have collected all information and assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, supervised since October.
It is believed that its crew will take inflatable migrants on board, which will be delivered directly from Human Tripers, and that the smuggler can take off so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such coincidence was allegedly only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being supervised by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board, which monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared themselves ready to keep themselves the code: Save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring "significant changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, which indicates that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local citizens have borrowed fruit.
"In the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He gave plans for further discussions with Libyan villages this month known about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Michelle Carter sentenced because of the texts that Conrad Roy urge to suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years were exposed to probation.
Carter was convicted in June due to negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is blurred.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years, but its legal representative argued that both her and MR Roy suffered from a psychic disease.
Clothed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and eyes directed eyes, as they were convicted.
"Her actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutors the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility, "she said.
"She has not shown a remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance you completely regret".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said it's "no day there is not the loss of my beloved son mourners.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything.I try to be there despite all my pain, which we will wear for eternity with us, for his sisters, "says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she will "pursue" by the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or a aunt would be for his children.
"Do not have this single person with which I've been together for my birth every day, is a pain that I will always retain for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to call another commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang you, Spring from a building, forse yourself, I do not know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
To the few who defended Carters, Amanda Knox, who was condemned in 2007 because of murder of their British roommate in Italy before it was acquitted two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Audi is said to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction confronted
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that "it gives more smarter options as driving restrictions", and related to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the activities as a callback.
European car manufacturers have greatly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of automobile manufacturers, installations for neutralizing the exhaust gases expelled from diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to bode the powerful car companies and ignore signs of problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could use the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but back to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were charged, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be made in court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circumvent emission rules in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded.
Involvement of Audi in the investigation could severely burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender decreases due to the conditions reminiscent of the conditions and the diseases of the diseases, which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions are prepared for great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agrarforship Institute Crieppam in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the early age.
This has an impact on lavender life.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf skills, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And there is a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts for vacationers, it is also high for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce normally meet on Wednesdays to review their recent chaos plans in the state of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children in the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, ally.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smuggles, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of standing at the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos dangerous by Mexico.
There is no break from violence, and while the corpses are piling throughout the country, more and more journalists are at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has started his office in December 2012.589 are under the attacks and threats under Federal Protection and so far there was at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs.
His absence is perceived deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger with the word "justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building.Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamah.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although 2010 was built a special federal prosecutor in order to process the cases of journalists, this has initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the committee to protect journalists.
As with most thousands of murds, which are associated with drug trafficking and organized crimes every year, the killers of journalists are rarely placed in court.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are unressive and although the terrain is still treacherous.
Without information on the murderers, without righteousness, the meeting to discuss the security of safety has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we do not know why, we mistrust all."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper's office Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men.He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "twelfth river" is translated.
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adults.
Rumors tend to release freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzmans arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the world's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people on the road are shot every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, which are greater than many homes for the living.
For one minute, forgot that there is a state of "calm" if only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with blamed that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
Initially, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosches.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He worked in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he felt with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar investments.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without pushing the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a call for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard-true investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for its reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever they led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue life," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug Trading in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take the task that as a journalist is scared - either that or you play the stupid.
I do not want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... Why did not you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dock worker, the friend, which was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now ask: Was his love for the routine to spoil?
His death also forced her to ask her own assumptions about how best to do her work and remain alive.
"You do not like it when you deal with your women, your children, their clean shops, their secret start and runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-congestion and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The anger is said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no phones were suddenly allowed.Days Previous was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen searched protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who described the governor himself as a non-trustworthy.
It has been months since reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has opened on three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the state spending, which focused on the hometown of the governor.
And there was a group removed in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the public prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite ladder of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public recordings that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption due to high-caliber cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locally, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the Column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim bodystay.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something to what they would never expect themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the public prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is.
In the whole country, journalists have become volume, by written down in organized protests "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spine journalists and let them kill because they said the truth.
She has asked that she has been re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated its objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists were "surrounded" in Mexico of organized crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also on the order of politicians and security forces, which stuck with the organized crime under a blanket.
The Media Guardian group "Articulo 19" has allocated more than half of the attacks on police and officials in the past year.
"In Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana from Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their hometowns or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, which was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, as suddenly all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with Bandenrivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as it was promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb edges you have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who kept watching to see if they were in their willingness.
If they were scared at all, they did not show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle fingers were visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his marks.
"How can you only close to thinking," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the road for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a frightening.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that she could even realize that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the chalk period before between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has astonished researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn wireless when on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, Grub.
He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosauriers."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide before predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterclothes, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better in his environment and to dodge his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta Markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours spent carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible.Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
She discovered the counter shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than her bottom.
Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favor the conciliation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter shady - think of deer, zebras or armadises - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, indicating that this nodosaur was exposed to a true fight for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk period must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life, including his preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died was getting into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much continued inland as they are today.
"This nodosaur is really noteworthy because it completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that today's animal looks almost as well as in the early chalk period.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it.If you just squint a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping on. "
The chalk time was a time as huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn wireless when he was located on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, Grub.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long lace, which protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specifics are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover bumpy tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is seldom like a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified residues of the skin are still covering the bumpy armored plates that carry the pet's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole '.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just a day after you arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a mail from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said there.
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @theepharoah was constantly returned on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live, live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was outstretched on the street and would stay four hours there.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She laid her mobile phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield Drive later.
There were photos of Policy Meility and people who screamed, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, emerging another policeman his rifle and screamed, "I'll give you ... Animals all kill."
"That's not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we got used to and that we can call typically."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", In the cinemas from the 11th.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength, and resilience, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, which wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for that, what they believe?"she reminded himself to what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right.
I could not take her with me, "Ferrell said later.
"That what happened today is a highlight of which ... what happened in the past.
She has to know it and see it and raised it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black make-up and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different than the next black women's child.
I feel like I would prove a bad service to keep them away. "
The first station when she arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place to the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter associated with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped to pass on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to accept ferrell's activism.
"My activism has changed totally after the 9th of August," she said, notes that she as a student at the University of Missouri-St.Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association was and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came Ferrell in mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can explo?"
This skepticism was nourished by innumerable cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death tract occupants.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team followed "Whose Streets?"In the years to Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us, we talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are presented, because so I will be displayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah's leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she turned out to be the most openmostParticipant in the movie.
As a result, documents show "Whose Streets?"Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she fell in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and in the mene pity of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in wider black-lives-matt movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 shaped the movie "blacklivesmatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly struggling at different fronts.
Black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything. "
Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".
However, it considers that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film due to its identity.
"She was the person who grabbed this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because in a life of these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much on the game.
You can feel your energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years because of the blocking of a highway in a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to see - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg made of cheek-skater and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analytiker went a 35-year-old prison sentence after being a secretly classified diplomatic reports about the website Wikileaks publicly made.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called a Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and manning, a transfria and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed than only three days in hisOffice had.
DeWey-Hagborg has through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone could look like with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit some intellectual comment not only to the moldability of DNA data- The many ways as can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as a Bradley Edward, but has already talked about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a granular, black and white selfie, in which manning sighted visibly uncomfortable on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blond wig - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 Stranger Visions project.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers of forensic artifacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum, with the DNA extracted from the garbage to make a picture of how these people could look like.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They led an interview with Chelsea manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not attend at that time and she could not be photographed, so they stopped in contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
She even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kantungo, which predicted a future in which the President Chelseas would convert judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.
That Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There are also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to the rigid divisions he should actually fix,Continue to escape.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In a artistic statement set on the wall of the gallery, manning demanded with her oversized signature ("I" in her surname is with a heart) an end to "automatic fragment, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandofower of CS and GS and AS, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will take away from it is that our genome is not taking care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spirious Memories, also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition stored in its own room is a page from the above-mentioned comic amendment.
She shows manning as she appears with a hands-free telephone in the hand from the discipline seeds of the United States like King-Kong.
"If you choose your speech, then you won," says.
"So never stop his mouth".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book anticipated - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from its own genomic simulacrene, which is like hordesProtesting coils.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, manning stature), in which your genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also stuck behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide man hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are sought as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was stabbed deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were exhibited due to murder because of their alleged stake in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the district court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, approached the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still explained at the place of action for dead, and detectives examine the stitches as a murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for university relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem has now been assured and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigations on every conceivable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglimeli, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them, amplify themselves," Guglimmi said.
Guglimeli said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglelmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building building manager, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that in apartment 1008 something had happened.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglelmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic event."
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - the Russian Vice Premier Mutko
The Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the timetable, Rusada has received the right to schedule and test UK Anti-Doping) in collaboration with Ukad.
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard, "said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA timetable to comply with the code describing the reinstatement criteria and recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing, which could give rise to Russia to worry.
"Everything was announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is determined that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the examination approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored dopings in Russian sports.
In terms of the matter, Mutko said, "We conduct the investigation because our anti-doping system has justified a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist. "
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the Head of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales center RSPORT At the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to unconditionally accept this report, "Smirnov added.
Rusada was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal of Wada from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping (Ukad).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, Wada General Director of Olivier Niggli explained that Rusada moves "in the right direction" to be used again.
The start-ups that will help your business will not be going to the next
Amy Erlett wanted to measure happiness with her e-commerce start-up at her employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if they promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75 person San Francisco E-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to carry out surveys, to address special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allowing whistleblowersto bypass the C-Suite executives and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the fitbit for your business?"said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools of companies are used to trade employees commitment.
Erlett said that she won a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance, which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so they can drill out why.
Companies have to see that the workplace culture must stay at the top of the workplace so that they will not be involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post, which describes an environment of harassmentThe ones who spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Financial Technical Website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in abusive.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including AirBNB, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and watch the heat cards of their problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the main manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that his employees behave poorly or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, workers fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.
Now that the company Convercent uses, problems previously hidden from executives, which were sitting in cities or states bureau - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices faster and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who guides the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders before employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee commitment in 2002 more serious after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to her right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online.
"Before using ethics's monitoring technology, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and ConVERCENT offer their software as a service, and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised all capital to $ 47 million.
Glitters secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all his financing to $ 60 million.
These investments are barely surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only use.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are glad to be in a company, feel their voices, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience on LinkedIn used both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well.Companies are running well when employees are used and committed.
If the third-party Analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company take no action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 calls," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relyed too much on collecting data.
"Because if you do not follow employees ask yourself," did you really hear me?
Take care of that?
And if you do not care about why I should?"
Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was reorganized by the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and add communication training to tackle the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If they are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, they will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, they also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then they will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes at 11pm as a lot of UCLA football players talking on one side of the new team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their trico parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are inscribed to the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and she has actually extended her days - at least to the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 o'clock to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.
You should stop exercises during the course of August.20 Before starting formal game preparations for your prelude to Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the control change of the NCAA, even if they add the many-worked routes of the players another point.
"We put this tremendous burden for three or four days on them, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they pick them up, they are great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
The UCLA will end your practices as soon as the camp is finished, given to the clear sights of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-footed hotel, which has already been aimed with footballs, which gave a protective net behind a goalpost, no easy task will be.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our safety," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not farailed to think that people rent a room there and then set themselves there to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
That's why I do not worry too much.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify facts inspection in the fight against counterfeit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third parties of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution then the world's largest online social network said on Thursday.It is one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false messages and send them to factual checkers that may display the facts of the facts from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political topic in Europe, with the French voters being flooded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they do not succeedTo quickly eliminate hate-filled postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook in a separate explanation in German, that in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new factual review was started.
"In addition to the knowledge contaminated which stories of facts of third parties are challenged, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the "related article" and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980s.
But Scotney experienced 700 years of turbulent story from his cozy seat in the Kühr River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mopharige Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistful.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney.Each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and other stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700-he worked for the Jacobiner," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell smoke, because at that time, a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were even there.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("to be honest: I have my welcome greeting a little overvalued") this all seems all thisto be too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle to see the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape keepers, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "whiskey and writing to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received only 2006 to full access than the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff just started to take care of the archive that he as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it in the attic ".
Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.
Guys, let's go his gear! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the broader base in English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a recording of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', who tells the story of the Jesuit Father, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggller Arthur Darrell is presented from the 18th century, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made later years later when his coffin was crowded).
The Darrells are Rhodes' liebel family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a rogue, always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell-men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a talent to promote hergeres. "
After the end of his mission in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämänmäki behind him, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: "Oh, now I have to finish with the damn life again."
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He planned to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the congress.
"This law will reduce poverty that increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the US how to spend the citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as they thought that in 2017, it can not become crazier, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes indeed.
Sex robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritized professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the Frr, we have to start taking her rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize his robot according to his beliefs," select everything, from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.
But it becomes more worrying, as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a steppord woman out of progressive.
Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the realbotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing such as shyness.
And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex Robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is customized to your personality as well as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what she likes, and she does not like what she does not like, etc.
In the course of the day she also has her moods - how real people!
She can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood"! "
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the allusions to rape, if one goes a step towards frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, troublesOne most.
True Companion Roxxxy compared to his website with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator, why can men have no roxxxy?"it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just just another sex toys.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course do not keep sex robots, and while the MRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain temporarily on the edge of the consumer culture.
But what comes out of the edge zones can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive, until the free market gives you permission.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House, which has beamed out to have sexually attacked women.
The quenching aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of Magd') are not the graphic images, the devoured bodies and the outset eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but right now this does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Your builder want you to feel human that you mimize the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can not break away from your companion or just go away.
You have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything, which could disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are compliant slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy sense
It has become a trump-era trump-era that the political divisions, which have polarized the US electorate, have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.
We all allegedly strict us to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been working for a long time with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the unit may have a mighty effect against a common enemy.
With Trump in the White House everyone who knows you know, including the Republican kinship, with which they had fought for decades for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
The dining table is certainly a good thing, but I remember in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that one day his viticles will no longer be repel.
However, there is an even more scary long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the right wing "normalized", which suddenly appear suddenly as the epitome of rationality compared to its standards.
I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urkomy version of the crazy attack - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked at) - both of them in the case of trump in factvery mild offenses occur.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel at Central Park, the largest of the carousel of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city when you do not need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growled and the animals are twisted to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climbing music conveys this on a strangely manner.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not entirely across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a weird magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked.
On the other hand, I was forced in a department store this week to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compensate for the evaluation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also practices pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetic grinning, while I made tired the experience to rich my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius laid with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of a first kestral judgment due to murder after an appeal of prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shaking her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius appeal, from which they say they are too lenient.
The National Law enforcement authority said that she would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty is increased to 15 years when prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece because of illegal campsites, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted on television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tentous people was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while a study is currently running.
The Foreign Ministry reported BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camping and attach to anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for this purpose, significant fines.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.
But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable state that concerns about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the people concerned is usually to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The Senior Researcher, dr.Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to make sure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation will be balanced by cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends to fall in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice, which carry a particular bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus Reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells ".
He suggested that the combination of L. Reuteri and a tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory bowel promotes, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral student.Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study meals had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but that was housed separately, did not have.
She suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes had to do the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The doughs of the mice were sequenced DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them lacked in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that a darmicrobial lacked and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. Reuteri and the immune cells were created.
In order to understand how the bacteria impacted the immune system, the researchers L. Reuteri grown in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr.Cervantes-Barragan said that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. Reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known if Tryptophan by-products from L. Reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. Reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United with Nemanja Matic signed a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul PogbaAnd Andreas Pereira pre-marched at will.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho shaped his start-Xi for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club has already made a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new obligations.
"Three of four to get, but I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if you get four of four for me, but they have gone bigger effort."
British inventor sits himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open its front door, enter its office and can even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BeTeq.
He has dealt with Dr. med.Geoff Watson, an advisory Anesthesist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, combined to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out by medical standard.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and only lasts 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that emphasizes American production last month, taxpayers will charge up to 24,000 US dollars according to the information of the military, which was left to the Time Magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine ONE, when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American Construction Programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The connecticut manufactured helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that for operationof the helicopter is responsible.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event of its supervisor, the Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3:00 pm on the South Lawn on July 17, and so long ago until the lawn was vacated between 18:00 and 21:00 on this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the white house should be delayed, due to the restriction of the service hours a second team for the return flight would be needed.
The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground.
From the records made available to the time, it was not clear whether ultimately a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch ACT prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds as if you are locked," the Deputy Commander answered.
The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the hatch act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus for the reform of health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curbing government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But you only request your use for a photo OP is unusual.
Trump led an investigation in February, when the presidential aircraft made against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the show" Made in America "- the products from all 50 states produced, manufactured by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to settle the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-president support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget recordings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hour tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, however, the DOD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per flight hour.
Unit recordings are the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The white house argues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.
"To set the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement rates, is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources."
According to an edge study from 2015, the refund rates for DOD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.
At that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week, which are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of helping them to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course it is appropriate to highlight that. "
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."

Has the PSG Barcelona warned before Neymar three years ago?
The site of La Liga likes to regret your interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not settle in its persecution of Neymar after leaving an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause, but did you warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record overflow?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, because the LIGUE 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world.PSG offers wages from more than 500,000 GBP a week.
Barcelona is angry about the way, as Neymar has forced his way out outside, although a source near the Catalan board consists of that the club has always given its best to have been in place since its arrival from Santos in 2013To take care of it.
But the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG President before this view?
When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club, who wanted to sign one of the best players from PSG.
"I'm not worried because you know that if you touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact your players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if you try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Ratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the international Italy to leave in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
