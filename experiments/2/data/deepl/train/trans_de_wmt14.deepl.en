A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to fix the decaying highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every kilometre driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning agencies to overhaul the antiquated system of funding US roads.
The normally dull field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups to argue that the government should be able to use the little boxes to record kilometres driven - and possibly where they were driven - and then use the information to calculate tax assessments.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are waiting no longer.
They are currently looking at how they can move to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next decade.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's not something we're going to use only potentially," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans a record of miles driven on all California motorists in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology to do it is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes US Americans pay at the pump, is broke.
But people in America are not filling up as much as they used to.
Cars use less petrol.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians dare not raise the tax even one cent when fuel prices are high.
"The gasoline tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage-based payment system.
"That represents the most viable long-term alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea has appeal to urban liberals because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in ways that reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners are counting on the system in devising strategies to meet the state's ambitious climate change goals, which are enshrined in law.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free marketers the Reason Foundation also like the idea of making drivers pay by distance travelled.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have covered 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move, responding to concerns from rural congressmen who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or into town in their daily lives.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees instead of fuel taxes to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the departments of transportation of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently studying how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices, motorists were sceptical at the thought of the government tracking their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big issue," explains Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
As the test got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into full-blown surveillance devices."
It said there was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals' daily movements.
Nevada is among a number of states now looking at affordable technology that would allow the state to record miles driven, but not exactly when or where.
This, Khan says, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some agencies to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company didn't originally set out to help states tax drivers.
Rather, its goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on the miles they drive.
But the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners because they don't use GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a wary public by equipping the devices with more features than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that can also pay parking fees, require insurance to be paid only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," a city planning document says.
Some transportation planners, however, wonder if all the talk about pay-per-mile isn't just a giant red herring.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrids or other vehicles that use little gasoline, so they too pay their fair share.
"There's no need for surgery when an aspirin will do just as well," explains Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about their privacy and numerous other things.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US surveillance
US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even though the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalise political expression with the threat of punishment where no defence is possible."
Telling the truth, however, is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the US government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness if possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US".
Ströbele, a Green Party MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the former NSA employee's lawyer, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden states in his letter that he faces a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that has driven him from his home country.
However, he said he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians - including in the United States - have called the revelations about an unchecked system of extensive surveillance a public service.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "once the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars to passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though Wednesday's announcement said passengers would be allowed to keep the whole can.
The new charge applies to hand luggage in the overhead bin; small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge US$25 if the fee was paid in advance and US$100 for travellers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the US$100 fee was aimed at encouraging travellers to take care of payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge that amount," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid them therefore stuffed as much as they could in their hand luggage, which meant overhead bins were often overflowing.
Fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about Frontier's most loyal customers, who have clearly expressed that it is getting harder and harder to find space in the overhead compartment.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at Frontier's gate may be allowed to take one piece of luggage for free, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be aware of the fee before they got to the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will not come into effect until the summer, with no exact date yet.
Passengers often grumble about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to resort to them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are bringing in enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far kept their hands off carry-on baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and was later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows extra fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee was generating US$50 million a year for Spirit.
Sorensen, who formerly held an executive position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what to expect at the gate when passengers were confronted with the company's unusual carry-on fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I have experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and hand-wringing discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and boarding went like clockwork."
Frontier also follows Spirit in charging $2 for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be free.
US Airways had briefly tried charging for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to drive customers to its website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz US$10 to US$25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began awarding only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut again to 25 per cent of the distance flown.
As a result, a Frontier flight booked with a third-party provider for 1,000 miles will earn customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively by buying directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 per cent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by its parent, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get a handle on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
NSA says 'internal error' not hackers to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency late on Friday said a bug had crippled its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was down for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency explained in an emailed statement.
It said the problem would be fixed this evening.
It said the claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was down for at least six hours and continues to be down for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson had told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Classified information was not at risk, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, now finds itself in the bright light of public scrutiny and facing sharp criticism at home and abroad following revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme - a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence agency fuelled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier profits fall after drop in shipments and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the plane would be able to enter commercial service next September according to its ambitious schedule.
The test aircraft's maiden flight a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three more launches, making it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a share price drop of more than eight per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday, citing limited upside potential for the stock over the next quarter or two.
"While weaker aircraft delivery numbers were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a note to clients.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, firm orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers await the results of flight tests and want to see if the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential are accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chief executive Pierre Beaudoin says he is confident Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the jet enters commercial service.
Company executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was on schedule.
"The test aircraft has not been grounded longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to do a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This is done throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer will be able to put a CSeries aircraft into service 12 months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was reviewing its entry-into-service (EIS) planning and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight tests - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed until the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue slipped slightly to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 planes this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell to 26 from 83 aircraft.
The aerospace division's backlog was $32.9 billion as of Sept. 30, unchanged from Dec. 31.
"Aerospace results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in that division rose nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The transport division's order book stood at $32.6 billion on 30 September, up slightly from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by settlement problems on some large contracts.
Management said there will be new guidance for the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares fell 8.5 per cent to 4.83 Canadian dollars in afternoon trading on Thursday, after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aeroplane maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug lord against police investigation faces jail time
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld figure Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug baron he was facing a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld figure Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" and praised by criminologists as "first class", was arrested at his home in 2011 after police staked out Scarborough, whom he had represented in an earlier drugs case.
Officers observed Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the solicitor's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar association dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illicitly obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would become public.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine at an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and place the drugs, with a purity of 60 per cent, in a black golf glove under the lawyer's dustbin.
Shortly after dropping off the drugs, Scarborough made regular phone calls to Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers' football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming their discussion was subject to "attorney-client privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During police questioning, he stated that he operated an office at both his home and work addresses and that clients called him at home for legal matters.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug trafficking players, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone that you don't break the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer by getting too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was their lawyer.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal lawyer-client relationship.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I wanted to give information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I'd do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal lawyer to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and inspire trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction on three counts of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other 'persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a Q&A section about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
"We are in a scary situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" read the newspaper, which said the bill was unconstitutional.
"The bill is draconian and very punitive and we oppose it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's standing in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government is "effectively putting the media in a stranglehold" through the new law. In contrast, The Standard wrote that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and dubbed the bill "draconian".
The passage of the bill is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities for publishing security camera footage showing units deployed to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury mall.
Police Commissioner David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media figure for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being barred from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the property of those involved if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine can bankrupt most radio stations".
Moreover, the newspaper believes these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the Nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial controlling factor in public life.
"Left to their own devices, politicians are leading the country into bankruptcy and us back to the days of hunter-gatherers," he commented.
Kenyan lawmakers have drawn public ire in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their hefty salaries of about Sh532,000 tax-free per month - among the highest in the world.
UN announces new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations will begin work immediately on a set of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction announced twelve years ago.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began this evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs."
Security concerns grow in Mozambique amid clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, founder of the state and Mozambique's first president, to chant peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing for the country's future, she swapped her business attire for a T-shirt reading "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say it is unlikely that the country will fall back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining strength to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and to do so seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to settle tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
Neither of them is good at negotiating and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an ailing movement to extract concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to do better in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has launched unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south route.
Most of the fighting has taken place in Sofala province, a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but home to Beira, the port used by mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded guardedly when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress on development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life", according to one writer.
The stories of Thor show that "brute strength doesn't stand a chance against clever tricks", and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland argued for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been suggesting this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who were "overly didactic", children would "completely switch off" because in entertaining stories, the messages would be conveyed "subliminally".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You can have certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, revealed through the story rather than explained.
It's the old story of showing rather than telling.

You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, vaudeville performer Frank Fay, who worked as an emcee at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they were too well known to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we could continue to work with them.
This year's event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit for army veterans at Madison Square Garden that features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival has grown, so has the world of comedy.
A number of the comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional avenues, such as shows on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame with a sitcom on cable television (the tongue-in-cheek fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been part of the cast of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on racial issues) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
Among the festival's biggest draws is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks to himself, 'Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Oil price continues to slide to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
Benchmark crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel in late morning electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, marking a 5.8 per cent drop in October prices.
The large supply of crude has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there were hints of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after hitting its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks ruling on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the US on Thursday blocked a judge's order calling for changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk ("stop and frisk") programme and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's rulings would be stayed pending a decision on an appeal by the city.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way it was implementing its stop and question programme.
The city appealed her assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its policy and related training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the requested stay on Tuesday.
The appellate report said the judge should be relieved of the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US Judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, based in part on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latino men with the stop-and-frisk programme.
It appointed an outside agency to oversee the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in neighbourhoods where most stops were conducted.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after being stopped by police.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number recorded rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 during the tenure of non-partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg, most of them black and Latino men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men, all minorities, that became a class action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk programme say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police departments use the scheme.
Opponents say the changes will dampen police morale but not crime; also waste money and fail to solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of positions were eliminated in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end stop-and-frisk practices, which are constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implements checks.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair involving then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court heard.
"In the prosecution's view, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside people's homes hoping to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three processes to investigate stories investigatively: Phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "You bet he knew about it."
Rumours of Clarke having an affair were first picked up by NotW's features editor when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was recovered from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer that had Pawlby and her sister saved as "projects".
During the time the investigation was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about her, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying, "I have a story we want to run tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as with other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself was involved with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, it was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US did not use foreign espionage capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so they could expand their international competitiveness or profits."
But ever since whistleblower-turned-employee Edward Snowden began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought corporate paranoia over government surveillance to a new high.
The final straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate executives are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own firms.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"It doesn't work that way," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
A major shift is taking place in cloud computing as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to jurisdiction there and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, about ten per cent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider after the revelations about US data-mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP's deputy chief executive, says: "We're seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago - it's 'where is my data stored and can you guarantee it will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders argue that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That industrial espionage takes place is no surprise.
It has always been the case.
"It was an issue for many years and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed it," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Management doesn't usually brag about the countermeasures they've taken, because that gives attackers an advantage.
In large companies, it has long been drilled into employees that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
Germany's BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel second only to China among countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a blue-chip German company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Parents of Georgia teen who died in tragic accident believe it was murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta in the US state of Georgia, was found on 11 January in an upright mat that had been placed behind the bleachers in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts that.
"They are convinced their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff had concluded, he said.
"They believe it defies all logic, violates the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
Rather, he said, they are convinced the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"Their son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he commented.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death the result of foul play?
Moore told a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts whichever way they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the county sheriff's office was not immediately available for comment when contacted by us on Thursday.
A south Georgia court on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues as to how he died.
CDC release allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools stock epinephrine - the EpiPen brand auto-injection is most commonly used - to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislatures have recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
Also included in the report is a list of typical symptoms cited by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels like there is a hair on it" or "My tongue tingles".
Parents of intersex children can choose 'gender indeterminate'
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare a gender for such children, but can state "indeterminate" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding gender assignment surgeries for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is born neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexed, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding of gender identification is still not well developed, but most experts in the US advise using the best available information for gender assignment if determination is not possible, rather than waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding - if at all - to operate.
New York psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher, who specialises in gender identification issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing".
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but for most children this is not true," he said.
Gender assignment can be done without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops, he said.
The scientific data on how a child develops their gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission said intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gendered, but is determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics showed up in lower-ranking sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairiness, breasts and stature, higher-ranking sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and bias crime.
Boys who do not conform to the gender image now have a special camp.
It is now possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or "third gender" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) became the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifetime retention of an "undetermined" gender status.
German identity cards will in future have a third assignment, X for intersexual, in addition to M and W, the interior ministry said.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs in the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that "gender theory" be removed from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, saying: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, we're twisting two more pillars of civilisation."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she thought it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough without more restrictions, especially when you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
As recently as ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be erased and then reconstructed.
But now that it is known how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels growing up with the gender they have assigned, the ethical basis for surgery is being challenged.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether a person considers themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child altogether and also remove his testicles, then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, which it was not," Drescher says.
When the boy was about 15, he changed back to male and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward who are "not happy with the outcome".
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
Doctors were unclear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was due to have a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilised at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which meant his body couldn't produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The operation left him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organisation called the Interface Project to ensure that intersex people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based rights group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could "encourage labelling and stigmatisation".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a 'not determined' to the child," she explained.
We fear this will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't yet know how the law will play out, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about assignment at birth.
It is not a struggle that young children should be forced into at that point.
When they are adults, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says the German law "empowers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an associate in child psychiatry.
While she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents space, which means they don't have to rush into decisions," Baratz said.
"It buys them the time to do different tests and sort things out, giving them time before writing 'male' or 'female'.
That way, everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of parenthood.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that surrounds parents because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits them better - and that is wonderful.
This empowers children to make the decision for themselves.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polling in late 2011" to find out whether dropping Biden would look better for Obama's fading re-election hopes.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by senior campaign and White House staffers, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president would have on poll numbers.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the proposed switch.
In "Double Down", it is alleged that Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden despite their "close, personal relationship" before it was finally decided against such a move after data showed that Clinton's candidacy "would not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
"You have to remember that the president had terrible poll numbers at the time, so we thought, for God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley called the investigations "due diligence", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been expended during the campaign for re-election to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
"In campaigns, you don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless you're seriously thinking about something," Martin explained on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was thinking about a replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss had known about the potential switch.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had not known about the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"It's possible," Martin replied.
Fancy glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis harnessed the fluorescent properties of sea creatures to create a glow-in-the-dark treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for £200."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice cream glows.
We've been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold.
Each scoop costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
That in and of itself is impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we'll find a way to make it work.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, there was something magical about Halloween.
My sister and I got to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighbourhood.
Today, I've become more of a Halloween muffin.
For the past two years, I have been reluctant to hand out candy from my flat and probably won't this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I do look forward to every Halloween is the trend figures.
Costumes will account for about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now impersonate seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect lots of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk space men will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my amazement, we weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million on costumes for their pets this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of "hot dogs."
When it comes to candy, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of candy bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the US Department of Commerce, go trick-or-treating through neighbourhoods.
In fact, we will buy and - let's not kid ourselves - eat over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it will be sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn kernels.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more part of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls (which is in a real prison, by the way), Howl-O-Scream and The House of Shock.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognised haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those wonderful photos of you just peeing your pants that friends then put on Facebook where you can't get rid of them and then the guy you fancy leaves you a comment like "nice expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree - something we did from a young age.
Luckily, the "baby in a pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The jack-o'-lantern slowly rotting in the front yard probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score some real points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as a hands-free phone system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with assistance from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, explains, "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and an accessible route to world-class events.

Firefighters called to rescue doggy stuck 15 metres above ground on dangerous ledge in quarry
Cocker spaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor road accident
Three days later she was discovered in her predicament by a walker in the quarry
Firefighters abseiled down a rock face and rescued the dog from certain death.
Firefighters managed to bring a puppy to safety who was stuck on a 15-metre ledge in a rock face.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel dog, Ruby, had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, came to Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby back and thank firefighters from West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been frantically searching for their missing dog and posting cries for help on social media when she escaped into the quarry after the minor road accident.
At about 2:15pm on Wednesday, a walker walking his dog spotted the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre ledge in the quarry.
Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog crate.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said: "She was in a dangerous position.
She was in the middle of the rock face - 15 metres from the top and the bottom.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen stiff.
But she is fine now.
She ate some dog biscuits afterwards.
That was a pretty unusual rescue.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, technical rescue team specialist, said, "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, but he found nothing other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too much and she had collapsed, she probably would have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were worried it would fall down but it stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger declares he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a backing vocalist on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that "he hit on me when I was 18".
She added: "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative for Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever made advances on Katy Perry".
The representative added: "She may have mistaken him for someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed at number one straight away this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story on independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the cue for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde Bill referred to the potential economic benefits that more freedom to travel in the rest of Europe would bring, but - as expected - this played no part in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would only be a small concession for Brussels in return for what they really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that is already so outdated that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" canard was at least 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this age-old story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the European tune?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: The grand, post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to jettison the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded only this year - managed to grab almost five million votes in September's federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is turning out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the respective national economies are forced by adherence to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has locked its members into exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters - and German politicians would like to keep it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels-imposed "green" energy directives - code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage fixes in the world will not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris to eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving the struggling French economy to struggle.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a crucial by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to Britain's Labour Party that it cannot assume a split on the right will automatically benefit the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her new-found popularity among white working-class French people?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-Common Currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and that is very possible - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I am trying to make: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will coalesce to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of ingratiating itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does all this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of (in the last resort) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can stick where.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Co-operation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider following Norway's lead and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of rejecting the cuts proposed (and made) by Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately signify puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
Early puberty trend is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specialises in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is already growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
Speaking at the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Kaplowitz said these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - it's not usually a sign that puberty is now fast approaching," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odour, show up earlier in girls.
Yet there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (occurrence of the first menstrual period) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down slightly from 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breasts start to develop, it's at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with this Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is progressing.
It is debatable what actually constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates - something a paediatrician can monitor closely.
If it progresses more quickly, tests by an endicronologist might be indicated so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and ward off another consequence: premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth retardation and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, developmental speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have periods.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they will handle the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter got her period at ten.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys, like girls, enter puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 of girls aged six to nine that linked body fat to the onset of puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, he said, but there are many other factors at play.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We have to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers clash over seat width in face of big orders
A dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers in tourist class on long flights - not always the ones airlines care most about, but this designated space is key to efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in coach class, but US arch-rival Boeing says that should be up to airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when plane makers are vying to sell even bigger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes and are expecting record orders at the 17-21 November event.
How the rear of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats - is critical to the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernised "777X" holds 406 people with coach class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says its rival version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch-wide coach class seats, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often dish out blows over technical details via advertisements in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the running with more than 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing backers a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, accompanied by the caption: "Would you accept this?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats tighter than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
People are getting fatter in the face of changing diets, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 per cent, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average American male in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that proves an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat dimensions, saying it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fares and furnishings.
The company also says research shows the experience on the plane depends on more than seat width.
"It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful," explains Boeing flight cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it's about more elbow room, but for manufacturers, it's increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion by list price over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent more efficiency per seat on their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in the segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's claims about the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats on the 777.
The increased unit cost is still less than the ten seats per row aircraft currently in use.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins of ten seats per row on existing 777s suggest many passengers opted for the narrower layout, which could come with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic standpoint, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin interior design expert and founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The globetrotting jet salesmen even carry tape measures to re-measure the furnishings on their competitors.
Even as they tout comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density layouts for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but says it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more cabin customisability and offered wide aisle seats on some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say calls for a new industry standard are likely to fall flat but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could kill the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More trials are needed before human testing, which could take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy may one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, trying all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralise them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, took a "time-out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, if a future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them kick the habit," he explained.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor Party Minister Joe Tripodi is under investigation by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies changing maritime leasing regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Obeid lobbied various state ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after they expired in August 2005.
Now an investigation is underway into allegations that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified to that effect on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The leaseholders were against this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without public tender.
Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally supported public tendering.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who Tripodi confirmed had been pushing for a revamp of the government's leasing arrangements.
A telephone transcript provided to ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior civil servant who had moved to the ports ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
"Was the topic discussed in those phone conversations the drafting of the commercial leasing regulations?" deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not elaborate on what the target had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice already this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to 'authenticity test'
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If introduced, the test would be applied through a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor way for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion draft was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments regarding foreign workers because they could be taken as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners should get in line' and 'hire Australians first' are a very unpleasant throwback to the days when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant white workers should be protected - and if some in the region heard echoes of that historical artefact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once mooted by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others still under consideration.
If the "genuineness criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be screened to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after companies in the past that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers ended up hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island in a refugee boat this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son, who had come to Australia with him, has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work by HS2 Ltd proposes to deliver high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the UK Government on the plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase 2 is completed, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail link between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look at further route capacity and journey time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of an eventual journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are going ahead with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it we face a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Speaking on behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to be "unequivocal" in his commitment to Scottish inclusion on the HS2 network.
Brown said, "The high-speed rail link holds the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength provides a case for fast rail links across the UK."
That's why we are delighted to be working as a partner with the UK Government to explore options for a high speed rail link in Scotland that will create benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the enquiry report with UK Ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Rules on electronic devices on planes remain in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will still have to switch off tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, as long as they are in "flight mode".
Passengers are already allowed to do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision, which US airlines will have to do reams of work to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
The air navigation service provider CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight still apply in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on aircraft," it was announced.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said it was open to changes, but they would have to be initiated by lawmakers.
"We would welcome a review by CASA of the approval of electronic devices as we believe this would enhance the customer experience now that we offer (wireless entertainment) in-flight," a spokesman said.
Qantas said it would stick with its current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no plans to change this at this time," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US airlines differently depending on the age of their fleet.
They will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, carry-on programmes and customer education.
"After confirming its fleet's tolerance, an airline may allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA announced.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be securely stowed under the seat or in compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Pawnshops boom in Singapore as crisis hits middle class
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga trades a gold bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to help pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, that's where all my money is," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative assistant and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, such is the demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pawning jewellery is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in Janani Amirthalinga's case - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an APR of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent charged by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
Pawnshops, however, offer the advantage that no credit checks or income verification are required here, which is why loans can be obtained more quickly than from banks.
This is why millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, lower and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to help make up the difference as the economy sputters.
This week, ratings agency Standard & Poor's called growing household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt to GDP ratios in Asia, according to the agency.
Malaysia tops the list at 80 per cent of GDP, an increase from 60 per cent as recently as 2008.
Economists are also worried about high consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have added to the trend of pawning personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of pawned items in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 per cent increase in customers at its branches in recent months.
Growth in the pawn business has been so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia - where it operates four houses - but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's managing director.
The company is funding that with 60 per cent of the $66 million it raised in its Singapore IPO this week.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire over high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers are borrowing items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household debt," she explains.
Pawnbroking is increasingly socially accepted as short-term, secured finance.
Also, not all people who use pawnshops are in financial difficulty.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"They include the wealthy who need to borrow for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow shortages," Yeah says.
Sometimes they also just need money very quickly.
Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health system
The Australian government is insisting on the tough conditions attached to the 325 million Australian dollar bailout package for the Tasmanian health system to ensure the state government cannot squander the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population in the island nation, higher rates of chronic illness and system constraints.
The funding for a four-year period was agreed after government consultations with Independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency recovery package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency assistance for elective services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for cataracts, will eliminate backlogs.
There is also money for day hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with ideas that concerned hospital staff have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain current funding levels to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the extra money has been spent, she said.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure the state delivers health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if "it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable course."
Notwithstanding, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will go a long way in taking the state's public health system off the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these elective benefits will largely make up for recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is only a "band-aid solution".
"We are in the position we are in today because the Labor state government has taken $430 million out of the health system," he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million into it and then pretends it's good news, he said.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is convincing with exceptional production design and period detail, but it is also heavier fare than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the plot tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never slips into prurience or sensationalism - and therein lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a torturous penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and gitft gas munitions manufacturing facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while heavy clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline on
1 November deadline set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus to destroy or render "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.
The completion of this operation, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying the existing weapons and stockpiles.
There are believed to be about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, which includes mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came at a time of fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Of those, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors as their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now satisfied that it has seen all the major production and mixing/filling facilities cited by Syria and witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier this week, inspectors had said they had completed the first round of verifications, visiting 21 of 23 sites cited by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned ... according to the Syrian statement ... and the chemical weapons programme items present there had been relocated to other named facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC's executive committee next month.
"I take my hat off to the bravery and courage you all have shown in completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation," Ahmed Uzumcu, the monitoring agency's director-general, said in comments published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting Assad's government and its security forces in this civil war, which includes many members of the Alawites, a breakaway from Shia Islam.
Looking at further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a powerful explosion at an air defence facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
Anger over verdict for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried, as they believe Umar Patek should be summarily shot.
Patek, who spent nearly ten years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted persons, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing.
With suspended sentences, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
A guilty verdict was also reached on a number of terrorism-related charges, which included a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have sought the death penalty for the man, who is also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a massive bomb exploded in a pick-up truck parked outside the nightclub shortly after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while on life support.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the carnage and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He eluded capture for nearly a decade but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden barely four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaida.
"He did not turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he caused others.
The verdict came ahead of the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not make mobile phone calls)
Air travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, listen to music and watch movies from take-off to landing, but not make cellphone calls, according to new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline in question, FAA official Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage rules to reflect the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among those airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the approach, passengers must turn them off again and are not allowed to restart them until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other planes that have been retrofitted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the changes.
"When the new regulation is safely implemented - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit," Glading commented.
We are frankly tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
However, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data under three kilometres remain prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in public view because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must still be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
In-flight mobile phone calls also remain prohibited.
Regulatory authority for phone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national transportation issues told CBS News mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a concern, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmission towers," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has mounted on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies report that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore to turn off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment from FM radios carried by passengers, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and FAA-approved to be unaffected by electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers once they reach cruising altitude for a number of years.
Fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit minimal radiation when you turn pages.
But transmission levels are stronger when downloading or sending data.
Among the advocates of relaxing restrictions on device use by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to determine problems, but could find none.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of device use.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the disruption from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports from pilots of aircraft systems being disrupted by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the devices during instrument landings in poor visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island released
A bird flown to shore by air ambulance after being found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island has been released back into the wild.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was nursed by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migrant from northern Europe, held up by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "It was unable to fly any further, so we were contacted for help."
On its release, the water rail was fit and well again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing business to the table and defining what those who deliver prosperity and jobs in Britain want to change about our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, roughly representing UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses now export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while those in the EU are stagnating.
They would like to see new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil favoured from the government side, rather than being bogged down with the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their views on certain statutory issues - from anti-trust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe control over these key powers should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as businesses said the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone - even 40 per cent of large companies agreed, traditionally the most pro-European.
Finally, and probably most telling, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want the UK to chart a course towards changing the deal, and to have a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found among businesses of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that business is pushing for "meaningful change" that brings the reins of power back to the UK.
The stakes are high - a change to the deal and better terms for Britain would see 16 per cent change their minds in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This poll shows that British business is behind his plan for renegotiating Britain's terms for EU membership.
It also shows that businesses expect a renegotiation to significantly shift the balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the Eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which for businesses means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental shift in Brussels' approach to regulations.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller calls pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom executive said.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work has started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is stored, is causing increased risk on conventional routes, officials said.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes on stream in 2015.
Gazprom says construction in other downstream countries on the planned route will begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic devices on planes - although talking on mobile phones remains banned.

Royal Commission hearing: two YMCA workers charged with sex offences ahead of allegations against Jonathan Lord
Two New South Wales (NSW) YMCA staff had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were made against Caringbah children's nurse Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has heard.
But in its opening statement to the commission, the YMCA had said it had "never been involved in any incident of child sexual abuse in the organisation".
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with offences involving child pornography, and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall PE teacher had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he had known about the first case but was unaware of the second.
He acknowledged the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as being at the forefront of child safety".
Evidence before the commission instead shows that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second lowest rating out of a possible four in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that management had failed "from me down" in hiring Lord and had not ensured that staff were aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety policies.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sex offences against 12 boys during his two years working for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
Staff testified they observed violations including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, saying to one that he loved it, and letting children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that children's services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at the Caringbah YMCA, "was very intimidating and very aloof most of the time".
The manager said he would not accept statements from staff that they had been afraid to report to their supervisors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord rather affected their judgement, which is why they did not report him.
Hare said he had shared with the YMCA NSW board his view that the lesson the organisation needed to learn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board had agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to push staff to sign confidentiality pledges shortly after the allegations arose was made by the YMCA's executive director of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said this was to prevent contamination of evidence, but was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Griffith University professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, vetting, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would jump at the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old revealed his views on a range of domestic issues.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly confining his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying, "Yes, certainly, but it's unlikely to happen, so ..."
As horse show pundits flocked to Cardiff to choose the Horse of the Year, they were aware that a tough competition lay ahead.
But none were prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The toddler, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted easily through the three rounds to take the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, organised by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
Competing against men and women with elegant bowler hats, he had his plate cap on at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old Toffee around the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural pony handling skills, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and had practised with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great pair."
They had to compete against the entire field and walked off the course with a gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he'd competed with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells told us, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone was cheering and clapping for him."
He walked the length of the arena on sand and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he looks after.
The way he has started, it won't be long before he is at the Horse of the Year Show - and I am sure he will do well."
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they make a great team.
The judges scored Fenton and Toffee on how well they did and presented themselves in the show ring.
They look for good teamwork between pony and handler - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes played their part, it really suited the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after appeal
A Chinese newspaper that had called for the release of a reporter charged with defamation on its front page should be reformed, a press regulator has said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a partly state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Bureau of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about Zoomlion, a listed company, between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter's licence".
It also said it had "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to conduct a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that it identify the relevant responsible persons at the New Express and immediately review the New Express' management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for pay.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the trust of the public," he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was after money and fame.
I have realised that I did wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published a front-page apology, saying they had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several high-profile suspects have made confessions on television recently.
Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Drug tunnel with its own railway discovered between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric rail service, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the tunnel, measuring 120 by 90 centimetres, as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, authorities said.
Eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilogrammes of cocaine were seized when the tunnel was discovered, court records show.
Three men, who authorities said worked as drivers, were charged with possession and intent to sell marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences ranging from ten years to life if found guilty.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage tunnels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the October marijuana harvest in central Mexico, challenging the drug cartels on how to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre passage with tracks running from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police serve Assange with extradition warrant
British police today served an extradition warrant on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had served the 40-year-old Australian with a "notice to surrender" requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that if he failed to comply he would face arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex offence charges after exhausting his options under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had served "a 40-year-old man with a notice to present himself at a police station at a time of our choosing", a spokesman said.
He continues to breach conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy had no comment on the service of the police summons.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosure website WikiLeaks.
Driver who sped at 210 km/h with hot drink between legs fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210mph with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was stopped in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on 27 May.
After police pulled him over, they discovered the drinks cup between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Court Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He was given seven points and banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 costs and a £100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Treasury has provisionally costed through the CGT measure, but is still awaiting a final decision from Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes costing over £2 million in the 2012 budget, as well as annual charges for buyers holding homes as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, stamp duty revenue on residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds that for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said, "Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of associated anti-bypass legislation, it's hard to argue high-value properties are under-taxed, notwithstanding the impact of the outdated council tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London or discourage owners from selling," he added.
Prime properties - the top five to 10 per cent of the housing market by price - in London's affluent south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have risen in price by a record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a burgeoning 'domestic' market, with the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city experiencing an upward trend, according to research by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on how a dog's wagging tail relates to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it's well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain was responsible for moving the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the sideways tail wagging of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals while they watched films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analysed the behaviour.
We will probably soon understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We showed the dogs films of dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to use them to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (as seen from the wagging dog's perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was primarily to the left (again, from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate increased and they looked agitated.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience which movements to worry about and when not to.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction tends to be associated with friendly behaviour and the right side tends to produce less friendly behaviour, then you're reacting based on those experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, vets and trainers better understand their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right matter to dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it is a happy dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada said: "Dogs are more likely to walk towards a robot dog when its 'tail' is wagging to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming agitated - exactly the opposite of the Italian study."
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence across many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
But since their behaviour can be easily recorded, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer fell ill with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band were due to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to lead singer Alex Turner's illness, the concert has now had to be rescheduled.
The band's announcement came after they previously had to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said, "Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and as a result he is unfortunately unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November and the one at the Hydro in Glasgow has been rescheduled for 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 "cardinals eligible to vote".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as a consistory, was held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistory in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors would likely be down by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of eligible cardinals back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
Next year's consistory is significant because it is the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At present, he said, there is a bit of a surplus on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - this is all very new.
Valero said that typically bishops from big places are appointed cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he's going to appoint."
GM recalls new pickup trucks in US for seatback repair
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatback, according to a notice from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
Some of the trucks may have a defect in the mechanism for reclining the front seatback.
Because of this, they do not meet federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, creating an increased risk of injury," the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website read.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
Deliveries of the GM trucks began in June and represent the leading US automaker's most significant model launch since its bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009.
GM notified vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up 20 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 per cent to US$37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
Cry of desperation from an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice in hopes that change was possible
He says Obama made laudable efforts that were thwarted by Republican obstructionism
Blockade tactics do not excuse Obamacare website problems, drone strikes
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during my dismal second year of medical school.
It's called The Audacity to Win, and it chronicles Barack Obama's memoir of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient memoirs in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election became a landslide and news anchors paused to remind us of the historic significance of the hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
Back in 2008, when Obama took office, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, like being jolted out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic times - they seem a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has indeed changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognise the great and varied things Obama has achieved, from passing the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and killing Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that partisan obstructionism has overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain why you allow wiretapping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House's efforts to immobilise the media were the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work might contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, being an MP is not a predictable course, with an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shaping the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely of the government's own choosing.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I was under the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard about for so long.
But with Obama's approval ratings plummeting to below 45% this week, this book has made the return to 2008 all the harder.
It makes me long for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama took a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
'We need to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr President, and I could not agree with you more strongly.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, who is in a court battle over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim as he sought to wipe away questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important in deciding whether to scrap or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the legislation.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by a 53-vote margin after the recount.
Palmer called for an overhaul of the vote-counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after voting ends?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you march in, enter your details into a computer, vote immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Do people use them because they can then erase the results if they don't like them?
Voting with pencils these days is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has been looking at options for electronic voting and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
Public office, he said, was about public service.
"We seek no reward except that of history, which is that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global regulatory investigation into alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they were co-operating with authorities investigating the world's biggest financial market, where $5.3 quadrillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation that the Libor interbank trading scandal is dragging on.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said a fortnight ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said RBS had passed on records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have since been placed on leave from his current position as European head of spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was placed on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently looking into allegations that bankers colluded in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and emails dating back several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
News of the investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks' trading units in recent years but has been under pressure this year as low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in FX trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms meant that "you can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a trader in its London exchange-traded funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
It's a big victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that Barack Obama's closely held healthcare law is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the justices ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate - forcing US citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty - is constitutional under the state's fiscal authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the health law's requirement that states either expand Medicaid access requirements or else all state Medicaid funding would be eliminated was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of earlier Nortel patents, on Thursday launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against handset makers, including Google, the company that was outbid by Nortel in its bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for US$4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus strikes at the heart of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its bid several times and most recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being outbid on the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google infringed and continues to infringe the patents," the statement of claim said.
Rockstar is seeking heavy damages from Google, alleging Google's patent infringement was willful, the suit alleges.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" as he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which is based on the Nile and modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, a US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had mostly been targeted harshly by each government as a banned organisation since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mursi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the courthouse to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only briefly to allow the convoy of cars to cross the usually busy street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Derided as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as the candidate of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the finish line.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi drove to Cairo University where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a guarded position.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by chants of "The army and the people are one hand" by hundreds present in the university's largest auditorium.
Cairo University, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, vowing to reclaim presidential powers that the military council took from the head of state who was hounded out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bending to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seems to be bucking the trend.
The company has raised its full-year profit outlook and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company is now projecting full-year adjusted profit before tax of between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million in its previous guidance.
If the current targets are achieved, this will represent growth of 12 to 17 per cent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Managing director Graham Turner announced that Flight Centre achieved eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record annual earnings before interest and tax," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings performers.
In Australia, leisure recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker corporate travel market.
Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK did similarly well, while business customers here also spent less.
The US business recovered from a seasonally weaker first half and is expected to report a full-year profit for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to cover at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination will also include "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined English Literature and Language course will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will have to sit a stand-alone GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department for Education will publish the new English and maths syllabuses tomorrow - the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will announce a reorganisation of GCSE structures, including a new marking system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, education secretary Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus that we need to reform our exams system to restore public confidence", stressing GCSEs would become "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that less time is spent on maths in English schools - 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore get 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to set aside more time for maths in the timetable, coalition sources say the comprehensive maths exam - combined with a greater weighting of the subject in league tables - is likely to encourage schools to schedule more hours.
The curriculum will place more emphasis on "real-life problems", including financial maths.

Travelling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to be named "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father repeatedly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he only had a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a haematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be first, and still not be first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive over unpaved terrain with the medical equipment strapped to the roof to the villages that need help.
Not everything always goes smoothly.
More than once they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration and Bwelle - with his broad smile and boundless energy - is happy to join in the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team then starts examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from within a 60-kilometre radius of the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a range of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or a flat; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lights for the operating theatre and the disinfection equipment are powered by the group's generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exhausting workload, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
Then on Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - have performed 700 free surgeries in the last year and know that their work is making a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received has now enabled him to return to work.
"This is changing the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works nights at private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60 % of his charitable work, Bwelle said; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers with Bwelle's group.
He is always either at the hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to support Bwelle, it's a chance to get hands-on experience they would never get at home.
"We get to be in surgeries where we help dab blood or hold the instruments for Dr Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Obama backs down on health policy
After heavy criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands received a cancellation letter from their insurer, Republicans accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama qualified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have health insurance that works can keep it," he said during a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such notices to look for new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They are getting a better deal," he said.
The government said it was unsurprising that the five per cent of the population who bought their own insurance would have to look for another plan because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say very directly to these Americans: you deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform since October has been "miserable".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she said.
I am determined to win back your trust.
This statement from an angry Sebelius to an aide sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was recorded after an argument with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri. The issue was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long repeatedly badgered Sebelius, asking why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to sign up for a plan herself on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
John Kerry, in unprecedented admission, says US spying has gone 'unreasonably too far'
John Kerry, in an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, saying spying had gone "unreasonably too far" in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he shares responsibility with Barack Obama for going on "autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has thrown the US government into a diplomatic storm of outrage from its allies.
In a video-linked speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "Without question, the president and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have gone on virtually on autopilot simply because there was the capability to do so, going back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 9/11."
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US spying had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone unreasonably too far."
The President is determined to bring clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one need feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is bent on killing people, blowing themselves up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue cooperating with the US in anti-terror efforts, the chairman of the Senate European Affairs subcommittee said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counter-terrorism organisations because of frustration with National Security Agency surveillance.
"It's very important for US national security interests that the Europeans stay on board with our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, a first-time Democrat in the Senate who serves as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations and European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terror, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of intelligence said this week the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and shared with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides.
Amid all the hubbub, Murphy said his agency was preparing for the congressional trip to be held this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs are to be released in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also spoke of there being some "serious words".
He said European governments needed to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they themselves had been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was raped by a taxi driver has appealed the sentence and been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of making a false statement by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours of Sunday 10 June while two other men held her down.
However, footage from a video camera later showed that she had made it safely to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was held in police custody at the scene until the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"We're obviously very concerned, but we hope she'll be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the sentence and is out on 50,000 baht bail.
Australian reports said she was holidaying in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime.
Court sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could be anxious to improve its tarnished tourist image following the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that an acquittal will therefore be handed down.
