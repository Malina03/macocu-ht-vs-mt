Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has issued a warning for people of colour travelling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travellers, visitors, and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's statement reads.
A recently passed Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have civil rights violations happening to people.
They're being stopped because of the colour of their skin, they're being beaten up or killed," Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints with such frequency that we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning the organisation has issued for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while travelling across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's office showing that black motorists in the state are stopped 75 per cent more often than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and let their families, friends and co-workers know what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the country for the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller wasn't attacking the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he did attack its significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller berated Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you refer to that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Thy weary, thy poor, / Thy harassed masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of thy rich shores."
There was never a time when the "wretched refuse" was more visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is, in fact, a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at grassroots level after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of Exiles.
The linking of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing people have long wanted to change this back.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty leads the way.
She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh is on to something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of point of view perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics has something to learn from it.
"We welcome it and we're trying to understand it and we're going to keep it going until we figure it out," Black said.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be competing against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been voted team captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is quite humble.
Her captaincy speech was incredible," Black said.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room feeling very proud and they were very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will be competing in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the World Championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will compete in the 1,500m and the 5,000m heats.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "immensely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will be in the mix for medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very fortunate in this situation because we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to build on that home support and benefit from the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't take the heat from constituents
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before newspapers slammed him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
He scolded when criticised, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we shall be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him over it earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash of "So what?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He has also been adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and gamely debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people from coming to the governor's page - which is a public forum designated as official and staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people cracking the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md. was not hateful, but she questioned hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "advocacy".
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the old days when the same thing would have been done, that staff would have been dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for bashing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's day, the age of affordable postage had a similar effect to the internet.
Newspapers multiplied in number between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers pounced on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers slamming Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his stand on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are part of the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led all the way to the final round last year next door at Archerfield Links before losing to Paul Eales, has been linked with the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club built and we're seeing it achieve its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job in setting this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
England's Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because it was withdrawn the year after I won it.
To come back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
The event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the Helensburgh man.
"You want to do well but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's gone so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking is £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a cooker.
In fact, she rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in Indonesia's troubled Papua province, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called a "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It's a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1,026 elders were asked to vote by raising their hands in public in front of occupying forces.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control over the region and bars foreign journalists or rights observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent Papua New Guinea part comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs that have been transformed by rust into various shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant hand-woven turban, dark shirt and light skirt.
"Before, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including as much as US$150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Will Lose Everything" reads a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included accounts of atrocities in the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution being particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It has cost the local Papuans - the mama-mama [women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he would fulfil our hopes that justice would be restored," says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike burst through the darkness.
The startled children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers flared, soldiers were sent an order over an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them dead," said an official document obtained by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the looming danger and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, told TIME in sombre tones.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the following day 'filtered'.
Three weeks, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes said.
"I am tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I am scared," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus echoed the sentiment that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighbourhood.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Agitated villagers protested outside the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed here, TIME reported.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is strengthening the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribesmen who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papuan rights by instigating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty fuels discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since new flight routes to Nabire airport opened.
The few jobs that do exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting keep international media tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for failing to coordinate with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free media, so it's difficult to cover up evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, the Paniai people are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried in a compound just across the road from the police and military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire grips Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire found its way through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the skyscraper, coincidentally called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were asleep and we got up at the sound of the fire alarm and people shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting units were extinguishing the blaze and cooling the building at around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from cladding, the exterior covering used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believed the system of panels for insulation and cladding at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed about 80 people.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers bring prohibited items on plane, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent claimed they belatedly discovered they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something prohibited by TSA, 19.7 per cent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were Generation X members.
The most common items intentionally slipped past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted to knowingly carrying bladed items through security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed intentionally bringing prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it surveyed travellers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so intentionally.
Unsurprisingly, the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those flying most frequently.
However, the company points out that TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to carry or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt backs down over stalling of Obama-era rules to cut emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt retracted his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proving more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous job in a federal appeals court.
At issue is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in a timely manner.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet implementation deadlines and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others and set the implementation date in a settlement," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation by litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law seriously and the authority it gives us."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt will at some point use his "authority to delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure regulations are "based on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month would delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legislative pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - after our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in this case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is formed when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests."
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment, according to leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump demanded in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president berated him for publicly denouncing the wall. He reportedly told him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern US border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that a deal for the US to take refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "rotten" and "stupid" and that insisting the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "douche" after he proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: activists reenact racist lynching as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered scrutinisingly through the windscreen.
Inside, the occupants hovered in fear.
"We want that n ---- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams shattered the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene played out on 22 July is only a reenactment.
But when a noose is then thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience heaved very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It's really inconceivable that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organise the reenactment.
"It's a smudge on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that a wrong has never been righted.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said.
"We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A medical examiner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspects in the lynching trial.
But none was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the lynchings has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the summer primary for the first time.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said the rumour in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcom out of jail, the FBI said.
He was accompanied to the jail by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they then pulled away from the jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes here.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that not only participated in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identities of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community that if you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we're confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't relate to you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've been through".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of the head clan member for years, but said the role never gets any easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep that history alive because we don't want to go back to those days."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play opens with Malcom shouting at Hester and badgering him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, get off my property!"
Rascona returns fire.
There is a pause.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I being too harsh?
"No," said Greene, still chuckling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- er' back then."
"Yes they did," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just gotta hit the hard 'r.'"
And right there, the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replacing discomfort.
Everyone is preoccupied with getting this right, not just because of the game, but because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunshots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning gown, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every other word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance; many come just down the street.
They have all experienced nearly eight hours of Georgia's oppressive humidity as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the gravesites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained anecdotal, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels haunting.
As the final notes of the song fade out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, registering the fake blood and still bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy murmurs, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow actors and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional weight of the performance finally breaking through to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chat animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for the feeling the performance left her with.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions ... Coming from people who look like yourself and they're doing this because they look like you," she said.
"What this is really doing to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shootings."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminding people about civil rights.
He said he has already started planning next year's performance.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a learning moment," he said.
"The thing is, if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their own history, those who don't know their own history, are doomed to repeat it."
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarked on another restructuring programme to overcome pressures facing the business.
The job cuts, most of which were announced by chief executive John Fallon for late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of its previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 jobs lost.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million (US$394 million) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after posting 1 per cent growth to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato statement said Thursday night's explosion happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by individuals".
The statement said all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops at nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions. This came a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to move forward with the so-called "2015 ozone determinations," saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone determinations - which will measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will spur economic growth.
The effort, however, has sparked pushback from Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future at under 147 pounds, met for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation super featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime Saturday, both fighters are members of the top-five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect scale".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up [to 140 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that has Lomachenko fighting a 135-pound debut this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on Sept. 23.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking for it," Garcia said, later expressing an open mind to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter" and he might attend his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped short of generous praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the ko-out".
Garcia said the focus was to show punching power, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be made.
No other fight creates so much attention and buzz.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested are older than 18. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They are intended to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum process, after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics over the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases "suggesting that the person examined was 18 or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases the person had openly said they would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that's the way the measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't tell for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of incorrectly assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case it's about 10 percent."
West Virginia governor announces he is switching parties
. West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he was switching parties.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved on from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today, I will tell you with much prayer and much reflection ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game."
Mr Trump earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
He is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hinder rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched away from them in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very frank answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has had some pretty torrid times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is remodelled."
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress was made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players under strict IAAF criteria at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation at the IAAF Council.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain in France.
Some consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, set up by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the purse strings to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend big money to acquire players, but must counter it with legitimate revenue streams that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked bankrupting themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - would become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of €30 million.
And although Platini fell from grace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, they can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, meaning that the buy-out amount of €44.4 million for the next five years can be recognised in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions along with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered that team membership for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that might try to outsmart its financial watchdog by inflating their revenues through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the Qatar 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean UEFA will be even more alert to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show PSG made a profit of more than €10 million in 2015/16 on a turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of football's best players leave, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming PSG were in breach of the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial doping" with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS in reference to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state financing a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can have different ways or different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Nostalgia goes niche in 'Wet Hot American Summer' and 'Comrade Detective'
This iteration of history is at once nostalgic for the characters' glory days of the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artefact, it's equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurdist humour (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of reclaiming the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering-can principle, including a riff on '90s stalker movies like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-bad plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's lower lip beard from Singles, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old geezer.
It's the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise like some kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume is its logical conclusion, "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," the final scene of which will show the gang attending the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-versus-West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the Rhys Thomas-directed comedy purports to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The leads - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogue is dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the roster of famous voice actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'figure out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a desperate propaganda drama - an assassin wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays as one.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a shorter length, could better deliver its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a pile of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything into fodder for a binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and theirs.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes amid intensifying pressures.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressures on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate rises would be needed in the next few years to rein in inflation fuelled by Brexit and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time on the funding plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from next February, although it was said it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under the scheme - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the rate decision, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressures on real household incomes continue to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" degree than markets expect.
Markets currently forecast the first hike in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next year compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% it forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike, with GDP rising to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the Bank expects it to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and marginal pay rises, saying the tightening will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump over the next few years, but added that wages will recover "significantly" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy will also be boosted by rising demand for UK goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the Bank cut interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years for this to fully hit prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest verdict on interest rates, calls for a rate hike had been rising as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and it would pick up in coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: 'Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look loudly for deals and look to end the year in a positive manner.
The market is looking particularly good for those with existing deals coming to an end and those taking out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be able to access "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle against NHS funding for the drug.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex, which can reduce the risk of infection by around 86 per cent in high-risk patients, will now be delivered by the health service to an estimated 10,000 people via an initial three-year trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a High Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "defining moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, with more clinics to follow in October before it is rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medication taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there is just enough medication in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medication can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said, "This is a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to transform the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chief Executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said, "The priority now must be to ensure that the trial is rolled out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said, "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is conducted across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for property, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court flat in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold.
"Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi to make the most of the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't big enough to fit two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where people could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the brief.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn't just a matter of building a simple platform, but laying out the steel so that it was the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two full-height rooms on top of each other - with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the scheme.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By creating the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close off the kitchen when it's not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
What makes this one special is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you slide the door up, it slides very easily."
Clever use of space and storage enabled Joanne to gain an extra 16 sq ft, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will come in and do a calculation based on the floor size."
Here, they've managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It goes to show that a home can transform from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave it.
Brothers fight over US$500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest property empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former 'Carlton Football Club' director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion just three doors down from his younger brother Paul. The latter has taken him to the Supreme Court to have it clarified how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the split is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was invested in real estate and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller flats and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problematic issue for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I believed to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin claims Paul has excluded him.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the terms of their financial separation".
Colin has kept a very low profile, despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a resolution".
On Friday, that hope appeared to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staffers on his first day on the job, he outlined a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wants to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told staffers that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV ads are still going strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more dynamite without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff have managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that potentially furthers their views of the world.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on the advisers' penchant for feeding the president dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is bent on finding out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and started questioning staffers about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House general secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work out?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with some determined travellers who have negotiated a council-drawn ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street called Millionaire's Row.
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans with them, having only been turned out in May but not deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way through.
Angry residents pressed Solihull Council, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council must be forced into action by shame as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to keep paying my council tax if the council can't even stop this."
One resident, who did not want to be named, said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travellers only to be sacked by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen in the parking area."
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said, "We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police. We are taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence gathering, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case."
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that operate migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue doing so unless they abide by new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because its crew had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Jugend Rettet' boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew are believed to be taking on board inflatable boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers, allowing the smugglers to depart so that the boats can be used again.
At least one such encounter allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa are required to have, above all, an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "significant changes or impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among those refusing to sign is Nobel Prize-winning organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescues had dropped sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Michelle Carter convicted over texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free pending the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, her hands folded and her eyes downcast as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she totally regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that her "age or maturity or even mental illness had a significant impact on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy that said "there is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"To no longer have this one person that I have been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said the company believed "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for carmakers to install equipment to neutralise the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which used so-called defeat devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but backed off under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in engine development at Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a scheme to evade emissions regulations in Europe, and an enquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat from climate change.
Lavender is declining because of conditions reminiscent of drought and because of disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the longevity of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits leafhoppers, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them."
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil is not only attracting holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller ones that are underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer essential oil parts."
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for covering the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: taking their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: Adversaries, Neutrals, Allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings will do.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are among them: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is their editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
In the case of Riodoce, they still insist on covering the Sinaloa violence, even though they are heartbroken and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, Ibarra says.
"It is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"Until we know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The gunman drove off in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquillity" when only one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with guilt over not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, there was the February publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a landmark in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be around.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold US$50 worth of holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without running into the narcotics problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the paper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after founding Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You have to do the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked: what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could swear like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table there.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs while staying alive.
"They don't like you to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - any more than they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the 104 degree (40 ° C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountainous area where the drug gangs are under de facto control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was in order when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favourite haunt of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of politics for most of the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military ambush.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column the best-informed source on the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what was happening," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender physique.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, as staffers have become something they never expected themselves to be: Activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings in organised protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who are in cahoots with organised crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and civil servants last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the killings have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have chosen to close, like El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial headlined "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted down, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance of risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, with the last edition already finished, Riodoce's editors were sitting on the pavement outside the office drinking beer when suddenly everyone's phones started buzzing.
A series of shootouts with gang rivals and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen standing guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Beneath the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to cover the street."
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first evidence of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino was so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved they could even tell that its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and they said it had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers, who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you blink your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered in armour and resembles a walking tank, it was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over its body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershading - think deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signalling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got caught in a river and floated out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they do today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you squint your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them all, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of its more fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long (11.5m), six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that protruded from its shoulders.
Researchers believe the armoured herbivore was swept across western Canada until a flooded river swept it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armour in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's body
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as 'rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Fossilised remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armour plates that support the animal's skull.
Its right front foot lies at its side, its five fingers splayed upwards.
I can count the scales on its sole'.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb flat she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still on the street," it read.
Confused, as no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body sprawled on the street, where it would remain for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you.... Kill all the animals."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her saying.
"This is not the kind of killing we have become accustomed to and can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, as seen through the eyes of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled saying.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be brought up in it.
She needs to be well developed, not just activism and organising, but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to keep her away from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location across from the police department that became a camp area as the activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
It all came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what was happening.
A question occurred to Ferrell: "Are you trying to document or are you trying to find a story to exploit?"
This scepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people, often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centred, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone talking for us or talking to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most outspoken participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in humanising black people."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen to be the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence though she was front and centre because there's so much at stake in living at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
By now, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant, and she has felt committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
A fitting likeness: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the centre of the room at Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging from the ceiling by cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she made classified diplomatic messages public via the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg's algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning, from which 30 portraits were created of what someone might look like with that genomic data, created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been open about identifying as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just coming off the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic strip, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of serendipity.
There is something deep and strong about the show's opening now, too, as Donald Trump wages a war against government whistleblowers and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all this, she said that "things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname has a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how remarkably similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on view.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong, speakerphone in hand.
"If they cold-cock your speech, they've won," it says.
"So never shut up".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me", said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has yet to see the exhibition in person - as foreshadowed in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulacra flocking like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything else in the exhibition, right down to the size (5 " 2, Manning's stature), with her genetic haplogroups written in pencil.
"In the past I've had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation as well."
University of Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was fatally stabbed in a luxury Chicago flat.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbings as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem would now be on leave and had been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and are prepared to assist US investigators in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer for the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to locate the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in flat 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finalise the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)," he said.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's code compliance roadmap, which outlines the criteria for RUSADA's reinstatement and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Commenting on the matter, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted to past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was barred by WADA from conducting doping tests in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organisation's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA director general Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett tried to gauge happiness at your e-commerce start-up among your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent.
And even when you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called in outside people for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees are feeling.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target Special Groups and demographics, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite executives and go directly to the board of directors.
"They have tools now like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained better insight into what your employees are thinking and feeling in her three years with Glint.
In addition to Snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval scores - so you can drill down into why.
Companies are coming to realise that staying on top of workplace culture is essential, lest you become the next Uber embroiled in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customised "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behaviour.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and chief executive.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by managers sitting in city or state offices - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took "social media coming into its own" for companies to realise that you couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging businesses recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have backed both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from the likes of Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research that shows today's workforce expects more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued, and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged.
When third party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you find support.
Employee engagement data matters according to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow up employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate same-day action when a problem is reported on Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able, through the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, to reorganise several teams within the company and add communications training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're going to lose businesses.
NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes it a long day for the Bruins
It's approaching 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players chat on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops, revealing backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good portion of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"It's a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day practices to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until Friday's finale.
As a result, UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day the Bruins delayed the start of camp nearly a week from last season and held practical drills during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices during August. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, even if it added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this huge burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed through it, they continue to plod along, they're great guys.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will end its practices once camp is over, which will be no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are vacated during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"It's a real problem, and it's not a stretch to think that people will rent a room there and then set themselves up to record a drill there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security in car park 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles containing false news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their findings under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false news and send it to fact-checkers, who may display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters inundated with fake stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful postings like the one before elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that it was launching a test of the new fact-check in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Beyond knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its recent past, little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has seen 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy perch in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal connection to hold that letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story has been illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I just had this reaction to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days you lit a fire for the light.
For someone living 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if they were there too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so smitten with old papers that he's supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I overstated my welcome a little") this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to landscape keepers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who were working on the illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he "drank whiskey and started writing".
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying 'Oh, throw it in the attic'".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You'd think land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree two families fought over.
Boys, let it all go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader scale, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 in this book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', " Rhodes says.
"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought a riot was a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always running up debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking lads, with a talent for wooing heiresses."
With his stint at the castle over, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing experiences
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
"It was like, 'Oh, now I have to deal with this damn life again.'"
Washington changes green card rules
There will be a new US immigration plan to change green card rules, President Donald Trump has said, quoted by the media.
It includes lowering the legal immigrant limit to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work permit visas and restrictions on family-based visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is expected to be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, along comes a new report on technological developments in sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People make fun of them, but companies are shipping plenty of them, and we're going to see a lot more of them," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts to robots with silicone skin that feels warm to the touch - with consciously human responses achieved through artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customise" their robots according to their beliefs, choosing everything from the colour of the robot's eyes to the shape of its nipples to the type or colour of its fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customise their robots to the traits they find appealing such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as closely as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the submissive feminine qualities, the allusions to rape as one takes a step towards Frigid (meaning reluctant here) Farrah, are the most disturbing.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional extra.
Most men will not keep sex robots, of course, and while FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the fringes of consumer culture for now.
But what leaks out of the fringes can be instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap, after all, in that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Handmaid's Report') is not the graphic imagery, the twisted bodies and gouged out eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn't feel like much of a leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply walk away.
They have no agency or backstory, nothing to suggest independence or anything that might interfere with the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are compliant slaves.
Or to put it in 2017 parlance: Maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have also divided families in small ways.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin with whom she had fought for decades over policy, is suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.
Around the dinner table, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a broader context that it also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that one day his antics will no longer repulse us.
However, there is an even scarier long-term scenario in which Trump "normalises" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of sanity compared to his standards.
I find myself these days afflicted with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of crazy - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which strike one as very mild offences indeed compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will just have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Parks Department, and the best three bucks you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are snarling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders in fear - extremely sinister, and the strumming music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day I found out that Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park roundabout is still a strangely magical experience, though, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it full marks, but luckily no one asked.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe my credit card.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to inject personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department stores' stood grinning apologetically while I wearily went through the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which prison authorities said he suffered after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a toilet cubicle door in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people camping illegally in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are imposing significant fines on anyone found staying in a place not intended for that purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tilts too far towards inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that if the same system worked in humans, the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would promote more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found to be present in the mice with the immune cells, but absent in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cells to develop in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40m signing started in a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
However, Matic was ruled out of the Blues' pre-Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
As well as Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho shaped his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new signings but insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have done a great job."
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be microchipped so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military figures provided to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American builders.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The note indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at about 7am on 17 July for the 3pm event, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction on duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you are being cagey," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting its use just for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the Made In America show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to drop the US president at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said taxpayers did not shoulder the burden for any of the other props unveiled at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defence hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records list the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base at Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far less than this rate.
"Basing the cost to taxpayers on reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual appropriation."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in the fact that they contribute to our national security, and I assume hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It's appropriate, of course, to highlight that."
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he did get into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump addressed representatives from Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel takes centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, with the first receiving its first trailer and showcasing the show's latest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process, he added.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered to vote out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
GMB concerns over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit manufacturer McVitie about its long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their operations changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for upgrading production lines is not being progressed".
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said, "The failure to gain clarity from the general site manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, a key pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from a jobs, pay and prosperity perspective, and against a backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said, "The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value the ongoing engagement with staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with staff that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all our divisions and sites - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross' heritage as a manufacturing site. If there are any changes to our site operations, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189m bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world-record hold-up three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club look set to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.
Once completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG are offering wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, there will be consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price bids for Neymar.
