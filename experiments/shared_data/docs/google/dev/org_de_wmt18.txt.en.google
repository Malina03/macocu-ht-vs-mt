Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city. An asylum for the insane where young people are supposed to meet today. A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug. Allotment gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers. The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories. It's annoying when maps aren't up to date. Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass knows this. The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, offered by the state government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date - but that's why they are very informative. Especially when you compare them to current online maps. Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century. The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such. More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and communities. According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria. Her client: Napoleon. The French army commander occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria. Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course. Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria. Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and with it the Bavarian Surveying Administration. The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library. The comparison of the past and present is most impressive in the example of the state capital. The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together. An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map. Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877. Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city. The Untersendling houses are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705. Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When you zoom in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots of land from the so-called "original record" from which the property tax was derived. Small plots of land are no longer occupied by farmers - but allotment gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" complex. A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling. The Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert. On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine. In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt". Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people with delusions were once locked up. The Munich district insane asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established there in 1858/59. From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II. "He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called insane. He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who dealt with the institution for an exhibition . There was initially space for 280 patients, but this was later expanded to accommodate 500 patients. At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district insane asylum in Haar in 1905. The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric institutions in Germany, has been located there since 2006. On the site of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum. The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth center with training facilities. To the west is the soccer field of TSV München Ost, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s. In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural style based on the original building of the insane asylum, which was destroyed in bombing raids in the Second World War. Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, Kaufingerstrasse was called "Kaufinger Gasse". The Second World War also brought decisive changes in the heart of Munich. In December 1944, Allied bombs tore many holes in the city center. A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof. The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second main S-Bahn line are taking place. With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial photo - and the hole at Marienhof can be filled.
Electric fence project is elementary The Fischerbacher electric fence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year. The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got an idea on site. At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs. Markus Schwendemann first gave an insight into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, takes care of 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments. According to Schwendemann, the "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the only marketing channel for the milk from his cows that has no alternative. Only regional dishes are put on the holiday guests' table. Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "fundamentally important". I can't farm profitably on such steep terrain. The grassland area causes a lot of work, a lot has to be processed with a brushcutter. "We're struggling here with the conditions and the topography," stressed Schwendemann. In 2003 he took over his parents' business and manages it without chemical pesticides or fertilizers, even if he doesn't run an organic farm. For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the Leader funding". With costs of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported. It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while. "The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business," emphasized the mayor. Farmers are often criticized for the funding. In 2013, eleven participants fenced in a total of 25 parcels using the electric fence funding. The open area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023. Half of the total cost of 71,500 euros was funded by Leader, and a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach. This left the farmers with EUR 12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence. "The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You're doing a really good job, it doesn't work without farmers and rural women". Peter Weiß was also certain: "The best food is produced here". The landscape maintenance guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state subsidies for pasture fences. The aim is to keep the Black Forest open. The prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR. In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be farmable with a tractor (slope gradient over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation. For the Fischerbach pasture fence project 2018, eight participants with 24 plots are currently applying, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence. The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Secondhand smoke kills less lung cancer Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer from secondhand smoke. This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study. "According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year can be attributed to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher. As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994. At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking. The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections are proving to be very complex. The construction work on Villinger Strasse is in full swing and "is reasonably on time", according to the manager of the building yard, Fred Heinze. In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since there is a lot hidden underground that is not noted in the plans. The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, poses a major problem for the Stumpp construction crew. "The ignorance of drivers at red traffic lights and barriers is enormous," reports Heinze. The road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through. Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks. "The hot days were pretty exhausting. But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
No Davis Cup reform: Next best-of-five The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly. At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal, which was revolutionary for this sport, to only play Davis Cup singles for two winning sets, was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority by a hair's breadth. The five-movement classics, which are often very long but are also highly valued for that very reason, are retained in the traditional competition. 63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favor of the reform, the goal of the ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only just missed. "We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," said Haggerty. We will continue to work on improving the competitions. After many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral location had not even come up for voting. Only comparatively small details are new from 2018: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the following year. In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training grounds etc. will be relaxed and the players will have to attend fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers are canceling orders Electric jack of all trades Elon Musk likes to show off the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3". So far, he has ignored the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservations. In addition to the always triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed another, less glamorous number for the first time when the latest quarterly balance sheet was announced: that of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3. Musk has often been involved in the past few months the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, deliveries of which are just beginning. Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn. Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations. In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the €1000 (US$1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit". Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts that there are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations. However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders to date could become a problem. His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but the production side. Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles last year. In 2018 it should be - all models together - 500,000, in 2020 a million. The demand for it is obviously there. According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently being added every day. Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand new, never-before-tested production lines at maximum capacity without major interruptions. Many experts doubt that this is possible. But if there are longer delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla. Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church 750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be held in the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16 at 4:30 p.m. Due to its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to linger. The visitors of the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place. The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen have made it their concern to save and preserve the oldest building in town. Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem". In 1267, the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Bailiwick" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks. According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a manorial farm on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa. So people lived there too. As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, in addition to the lower and upper villages, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the manorial core of the village. Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts. The right of patronage arose from early medieval proprietary church law. A gentleman who built a church, furnished it and staffed it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church. Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop. There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower. The larger of the two burst at Christmas 1673. The newly purchased bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be surrendered in 1942 during the Second World War. During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen. The roof was leaking. In 1796, French troops camped near the church. They broke out the pulpit and pews and used them for firewood. Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809. Until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler. In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished. Only the church tower was left standing. On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed. To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished. Only the dwarf tower that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church. Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Rentern" team take care of the Hilarius facility as Dieter Dockhorn's successors. As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16th at the St. Hilarius chapel in the old cemetery. This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis. Mayor Hartmut Romann has the final word. The program starts at 4.30 p.m. Admission is from 3.30 p.m. At the end of the serenade there will be a drink in front of the cemetery. "Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers emphasize the fantastic view. The serenade takes place only in dry weather. The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler. The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to looking after their homeland, as the serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have wind turbines checked The "Boisheim defends itself" association has asked District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheim's Nette. It was done illegally. The association argues that at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city limits to Schwalmtal. In principle, the construction and operation of wind turbines is possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area. Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "sparged". A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved this due to a formal error. "Due to the lack of a legal planning requirement, the approval notice that was issued is still illegal and therefore has to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself". Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending. Erkens: "This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out under planning law". The Circle acknowledges receipt of the request. "The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week," said a spokesman. The circle takes it as an opportunity to examine the matter again. However, they are unlikely to lead to the process being stopped. With a view to the ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim defends itself" on Thursday. NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines, each 200 meters high, on an area on Boisheimer Nette. The company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect stake, concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site last year. With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirements of around 11,400 households should be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all Viersen households. NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros. Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in a terrible accident A terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district). A woman was fatally injured. Two other people were slightly injured. The state road remained closed for hours. According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
The city and retailers are planning a "home shopping" weekend in Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September. The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend of September 8th and 9th to lure the residents into the city center for a shopping spree. As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has in store apart from the usual supermarket goods. Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market. In addition, local companies should present their training positions. In addition, the shops in the city center should invite people to "shopping in the middle of the night". The campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region. According to Christian König, commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that refer to the campaign weekend are in preparation. The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the "Attractive inner city" project. This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Fountain Festival, including a Sunday when shops are open, discussions with all tradespeople and innkeepers to encourage them to take an active part. Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept. In addition, customer potential is to be newly or again developed. This includes spa guests and tourists. But many locals also lost sight of the city center when shopping. In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - right down to landlords, companies throughout the city and clubs. It is important to use a network to overcome the lethargy that has spread in some cases, König said in the spring. Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities are taking part in the third nationwide "Home Shopping" day. In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode. The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich. The campaign, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate environment with his purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school A gas explosion occurred in the school building during construction work. New more people were injured. A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others, some seriously. According to the fire brigade, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time). One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the blast. An initially missing person was later recovered dead. The dead were school employees. The authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline to be the cause of the accident. During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop. The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the remains of the Wall and a kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange. Parked in front of it is an open vintage Mercedes, in which the Rhinemaidens pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta. Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" production. The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully, as they did in "Rheingold". They kessily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo clique. Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavyweight boxer. The scene when he kills Siegfried is brutal. Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it. The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause. Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and forms his hands in the Merkel rhombus, are enthusiastically celebrated. There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - again in casual leisure clothing in view of the great heat. The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors had been eagerly awaited. In 2013 he had to endure a shrill whistle concert, but five years later there was great jubilation, in which the occasional "boo" was lost. Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it. "You can tell that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a certain way," she told dpa shortly before the performance. The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also gained an understanding of his point of view. I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer During your volunteer year, you work in several places. Where everywhere? Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge. And I have already worked at the school in the open full-time. How is your experience with it? Crowd: It's a nice, broad spectrum I see here. I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults. You are now 26 years old, so a late-call volunteer. how come Crowd: I graduated from high school. And then, let's say, successfully completed a degree in civil engineering. I've realized that it's the wrong thing for me and that I want to do something different, work with people. And then I asked myself, what are you doing? Do a social year, you get a glimpse, you can see what it's really like on site, perhaps also in the focal point. And was it? Crowd: I got great impressions. I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester. I'm going to study dual, I'm probably doing social work training at the youth welfare office in Herne and I'm studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm. Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service? Quantity: Yes, it is very variable. It always depends on where you do your FSJ. You can do it from a retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work. For me it was very varied. I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care. For me, that was exactly what appealed to me. I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works. Different from studying civil engineering? Menge: Of course, this is not about calculating statics. You always have other people in mind, each with a completely different story behind them. Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually. Very interesting. And you weren't afraid of contact? Crowd: I'm not the type for that. It's an area that gives you a lot. Lots of love, lots of kindness. There are also negative moments, but that's life.
Municipal council wants community room In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the Fluorn-Winzel community council decided to set up a community room in the future senior citizens' residential complex. Before the discussion, there is one important piece of information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden. Although it will still take some time before the area previously owned by the church community is owned by the community, there are no longer any planning obstacles for the project, which is to be managed by a private investor. There is a discussion about a common room for that. One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to accommodate the community. On the ground floor he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price. The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind that such a common room should not only be a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly housing, but open to the community. As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds. The decision, which was made in advance by providing funds for the current budget last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities. The building is in the redevelopment area. According to Tjaden, setting up a community room would be eligible for funding at 60 percent out of 30 percent. In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a spanner in the works in this regard, the proposal for a resolution provides for the statement that both a gabled roof - which is based on the surrounding buildings - and a pent roof - which reduces the eaves height and the Construction more economical power - would be possible. Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks that this addition is unnecessary. If it helps: it passes the board unanimously. It's not that easy in the common room. Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you don't really make much progress, but now you lean out of the window in the common room, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it". Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favor of the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation. She sees behind this a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors. That is just not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give you a subsidy, but you get a real value that can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-argument. Staiger's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly has three supporters. With two dissenting votes, the original program remains, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision like this, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with a car: a cyclist is thrown onto the road When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured. According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his bike at 12.20 p.m. on the Schwarzer Weg cycle path coming from Hilden. The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch. A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority. When Langenfelder drove onto the street, he apparently didn't pay attention to oncoming traffic. He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden. The man was thrown into the street. He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich has to do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund. FC Bayern is traveling to Dortmund for the first competitive game of the new season with personnel concerns. The defending champion in the Supercup is missing seven professionals against the cup winner. The personnel worries at the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund. Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB. The Italian confirmed this on Friday. In addition, Munich's Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing. Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game for the five defeats in the past six friendlies. "We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team. It hasn't been good lately." However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official competitive game of the season. "Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation. I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities. The team is ready. We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game". The duel between the two German football heavyweights casts a spell over the fans. The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the Harz The first "star path" in Germany is to be created in the Harz Mountains. This is planned by the Sankt Andreasberg observatory association. There has been a planet path in Göttingen since 2003. A "star path" meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it said. He combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance. The members want to set up boards along the planned route and provide information about the stars and constellations. In a first phase up to 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz. St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber could be considered. The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet. Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role when choosing a location. Accessibility is also a criterion. Later, the star path is to be expanded step by step. "On the Star Trail, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained. They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another even though it is much further away. It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is located and when it can best be seen. The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014. According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany. From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye. Since 2003, there has been something similar to the planned Star Trail in the university town, the Planetary Trail, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Society. Beginning in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna. The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end point, which has been demoted to a dwarf planet - are set up exactly at a distance and on a scale of one to two billion. The earth shrinks to a sphere with a diameter of 6.5 millimeters, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters. The total distance of the Planet Trail is a good four kilometers. While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto. Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space. But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Four injured after tire burst Four people were injured, some seriously, in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon. According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle around 4:30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, probably after a tire burst. The car spun to the right onto the embankment, where it overturned and then landed on its roof in the grassy verge. The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident, some seriously. While the rescue service was providing first aid to the injured, the A7 northbound was closed for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane was diverted past the scene of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Back three works better" Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 win against Braunschweig at the start of the season that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points. Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and also with the result if it hadn't been for the two goals conceded in the 2-2 win against Braunschweig. "That was two goals too many and we have to be even more careful in Aue," said the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender. In the Ore Mountains, the chain of three should also be further optimized. And the Fortunes don't want to catch a goal after a free kick anymore. "For the future it will be the case that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing) on the line." Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get along better with the back three than with the back four, even after the experience gained in preparation. "I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of himself, "because we have players in the back three in the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well ' said Hoffman. "The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we don't make so many mistakes during the build-up." Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game. "But I don't know whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw. The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann. "But if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, then we can definitely say that the season has started well." His coach didn't want to know anything about that. "I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm. "Now they can basically start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be a little fresher, since they didn't have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in their bones. "But they don't know 100 percent where they stand at the moment," says Fortuna's central defender. The guests from the Rhineland go into the match in the finally (almost) finished stadium in Aue as the slight favorites on Sunday. "The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the right to finish in the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record of just one defeat against Aue in nine games is quite positive. "There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach. "To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous". And that's not how Funkel wants to see his players on Sunday.
Right on schedule Work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well. On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach. "We are very well on time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager in the Department of Roads and Traffic in the Regional Council of Freiburg. In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that were in need of renovation. Construction is scheduled to end in October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met. The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach. It is an arched bridge made of concrete clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres. It was built in 1900. Like the other two bridges, it is now showing its age. In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated. The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach. They are built of red sandstone. Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long respectively. The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach received a so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side, which is 1.30 meters wide and weighs seven tons. This is an edge fortification that is also used as a service path. A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday. This is where the pedestrian walkway should go. The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo. The other two bridges already have the patented bridge caps. Laying the lines through the structure in Lauterbach required a great deal of finesse. A fiber optic cable also runs there, to which many companies are connected. In the run-up to the work, the local residents were informed about the project by flyers. In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished out first. For the bridges between the depot building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated to one lane by a traffic light. For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge near the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels is completely closed. The costs for the three bridge renovations total 700,000 euros. The whole thing is funded by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest over German potato salad It's not that common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), things come together that are otherwise difficult to reconcile . The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully flying the flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the "big election campaign start" according to the poster. And brings well-known names to the starting line - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal elections on September 24th, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch. But those who are there hours before the event begins don't want to listen to the AfD members, they want to demonstrate. The motto "The Eifel stays colourful". The city picnic was originally planned under the motto "Everyone at one table" on Brunnenplatz, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle. A colorful picture that presents itself. And what makes Christa Karoli, Chairwoman of Forums Eine Welt and one of the main organizers, really happy: "It's great how many people have come together here". There is music and lots of food, including a "original German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it. The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they are particularly present at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues. How did the AfD actually come up with Gerolstein? Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to organize such an event and was awarded the contract. The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked in Daun, but was rejected there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the Laurentius fair that had already been set up. So now the roundabout, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here". Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: "People have every right, the main thing is that it stays peaceful." It does: around 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment on the roundabout in front of the square, and various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge. There are around 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal elections, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches. The police presence has not changed, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening. The AfD event lasts a little over an hour, the guests on the forecourt have more staying power, but there too it is time to clean up shortly after 9 p.m. The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet The Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will be heard again as part of the Haslach Monastery Concerts series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church. Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass band music. Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras. Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphonieorchester. Both are united by the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the borders of the different genres. Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like it's in a new guise with the two, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazz Echo Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing are mixed into a fascinating total work of art . This core part of the program was premiered in Freiburg this spring with great success. The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart opens up about her bisexuality "Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives. But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart is open about her bisexuality. "Once I bite into grilled cheese I'm like, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'" Probably the Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately ended bitterly. Despite all of that, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine, "I've been seriously in love with everyone I've dated. Or do you think I played it?" After their split, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and genuinely believed in it. So it's never confused me or hindered me. I've just never liked not to be taken seriously." According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this when she was at school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls. That really hurt me a lot. When I was eleven, the children told me I would look like a boy. I felt really offended, scared and embarrassed. Now I look back and I'm like, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'." She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me. And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to justify myself in front of the whole public to have to."
Mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali At a memorial service in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1,000 people commemorated the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali. The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions. Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the cause of the crash, which is still unclear. However, she described the two pilots who died as "experts in their field". "We bow to this supreme sacrifice that you have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said. The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old staff captain from northern Hesse died in West African Mali a week ago on Wednesday. Their coffins were transferred to Germany and, accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake, brought to Fritzlar Cathedral in Sankt Peter on Thursday. At noon, initially only the relatives in the church said goodbye. The funeral service then began with family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians. Among them were the Prime Minister of Hesse, Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, Volker Wieker. Mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins. Fritzlar residents and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen in front of the church. Defense Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in action. The staff captain helped set up the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots in his regiment to receive training. Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one could have." Minister von der Leyen showed no doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous. But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said. After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral. The Bundeswehr did not provide any information on when and where they will be buried.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death. This was announced by the royal family on Thursday. Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral. The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two. The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said. It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried. But he has no intention of being buried in his native France. Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title. After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king. In 2016 he retired and also gave up the title of "Prince Consort". Since Henrik did not get the title and position he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family. It is still unclear where the 83-year-old's final resting place will be. However, he does not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark. He likes the country he has worked for the last 50 years. Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met Margrethe in London in 1965. On the Thames he worked in the French embassy. While the people's expressions of sympathy always flew towards his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign. In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything that happened I did, criticized. My Danish was shaky, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football, even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country, the brand being a socially critical intellectual, I couldn't hope for leniency. I was different. I seemed content with this position and not ashamed. Those were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favor of quick new elections in the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign. Weil spoke out in favor of dissolving parliament on Friday. Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis. Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP. The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme). "I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hanover on Friday. CDU faction leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his faction to include them. This means that the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats. So far the relationship has been the opposite. The new state parliament will be elected on January 14 next year. Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority. However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the state parliament decides to dissolve itself as quickly as possible. The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday. The state constitution also provides for the possibility for the state parliament to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister and elect a successor. "Our constitution offers several options. These options must be checked legally," said Thümler. "All questions will be discussed in peace once they have been properly examined from a legal point of view." Thümler called Twesten's step "a bit strange". The politician herself emphasized: "I'm not a traitor. I feel very good". She described herself as a supporter of black and green. The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her seat in the state parliament. "Of course, we assume that she will return her seat in the state parliament, which she received via the green state list, with immediate effect," said state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner. The parliamentary group leader of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We very much regret Elke Twesten's decision". She made a conscious decision not to have a debate in the group. "Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step." SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of the Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason. "The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green Party," wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday. He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the state parliament. Twesten's exit will cost Red-Green a majority in Lower Saxony. "In her injured vanity and her frustration, the politician put her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil. "It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigues and trying to make political capital out of it." Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU. The leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking. At that time, the CDU was the strongest force ahead of the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Interview with the Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr. Schmidt? Germany discusses contaminated eggs. How did the scandal happen? How can consumers protect themselves. Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND). Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs? I can only encourage all consumers to take a good look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp. The federal states post the latest information about the batches of eggs affected on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarning.de. Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned. Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible. Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture? Food monitoring is the task of the federal states. Nevertheless, my house immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the federal states since it became known that Germany was affected. All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers. Retailers, like manufacturers, have to ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health. If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not marketable. However, unencumbered eggs can be sold and consumed. It's not the farms' fault this time. Are production companies and consumers in the same boat? According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame. Rather, they have to reckon with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies. As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency. Is it just a lack of staff or also of coherent responsibility? It was the official controls that uncovered the process. However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal activity can never be ruled out 100 percent. For this very reason, consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor's office in cases in which criminal offenses may have occurred are of crucial importance. I have already made it clear several times that I expect a thorough investigation from the responsible authorities. Is the regular alarmism about food scandals really necessary? Consumers have the right to only receive safe and marketable food. When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged. The adulterated drug has put manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary. Basically, it must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately. This must be worked on consistently and at full speed at all levels. I expect all responsible authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier In recent years, Chocolat Frey has been producing on-board chocolate for Swiss. Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is re-tendering the contract. At the request of the sda news agency, Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report in the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday. According to current planning, the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018. The products are checked and quality controlled every two to three years. "We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman. Every year, flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red and white wrapped chocolate bars weighing 14 grams to passengers before they land. Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs. According to "Northwestern Switzerland", industry insiders estimate the order volume at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion francs. But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order. Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender. Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible. According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018. For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment. Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006. Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug. Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey. The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers. On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with delicacies from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers can enjoy chocolates from Lindt and in Economy Class chocolates from Chocolat Frey. Swiss chocolate from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul routes, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Olympic discus champion Robert Harting reaches World Championship final The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday. His brother Christoph, Olympic champion in 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands. The Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, also qualified for the final with the first attempt.
Strike against drug mafia in the state The police have struck a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg. On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Konstanz public prosecutor announced on Friday. 15 suspects between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them. The officers also seized large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros. Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy. There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians. The two will therefore probably be extradited to Germany. Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action. A total of over 300 police officers were on duty. The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion. The public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany since the summer of 2016. There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators from the Rottweil Criminal Police Office were in almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily. Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officers from Palermo. The investigations primarily targeted Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia. The gang is also responsible for an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning.
Weise complains that there are large gaps in the foreigners' register "data from citizens who shouldn't appear there": According to a report, the foreigners' register in Germany has significant deficiencies. This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures. According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners. Defects in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung". According to the information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries. The data is therefore managed by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany. Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far. In individual cases, data from 1921 was found "from people who have long since passed away, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register". "Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues. The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country at all. However, such incorrect assignments led to "a distorted debate about how to deal with those who were obliged to leave the country," according to the analysis. Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy if they entered the country from there. This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung". The paper states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since June 1, 2017". Since the end of 2014, this has practically no longer been possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site. According to the Dublin Agreement, the EU country that they reach first is responsible for refugees. If a migrant travels on to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry. As a reason, the office now writes: “In the meantime, the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly”. Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families. Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these promises to be sufficient. Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement. The domestic policy spokeswoman for the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Due to the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with receiving conditions that violate human rights and endanger the child's well-being."
Second-best result achieved The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach for other people. At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday. First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations. Traditionally, the municipality recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood at the municipal council meeting. "It's awesome how our body is designed for it and we show respect to the donors who donate their blood to strangers, and we do so unselfishly," emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner. "A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned goods are broken down into their components. Three people could benefit from one blood donation. At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring. "This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK district preparedness leader. Apparently, the move to the theater a few years ago led to a higher number of participants. Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were each awarded 50 blood donations. Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger recorded half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 milliliters of their lifeblood ten times.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol Since the address is unknown, the public's help is requested and hoped for. Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer. Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally not known, clues from the population are hoped for and requested. Europol reported on Friday about the campaign, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from winter. According to Europol, experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding at holiday destinations. 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together. The website www.eumostwanted has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times. 36 of those searched online have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of tips after publication on the website.
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise. The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1st next year. This is good news for the city. With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by what was then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the tourist tax. In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing number of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions. The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location. The decision was not without controversy in the municipal council at the time. Above all, Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious prospects for the house. He should be right. The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise. The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt property. Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb. They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise. At the former Hotel Birkenhof, rubbish containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out. The floors were torn out, ceilings were partially dismantled, and old bathtubs were removed from the rooms. The entire hotel building is a single construction site. There is still a lot to do before March. "It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper. Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style. The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed. Everything should later become "nicely citizen-friendly", as Thomas Scherer puts it. "We want to make a jewel out of it." The facilities include a swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room. Scherer emphasizes that they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but at a higher level in the city centre. The Waldhotel Luise, with around 60 rooms, wants to expand, Scherer explains. Both individual vacationers, groups and business people should feel comfortable in the hotel. According to Scherer, he has already had talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause. The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group. "We are on the same line." When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific. Just under a million euros, he calculates. The outdoor facilities are also being brought into shape, which is already clearly visible. A large terrace will be created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public. Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US special investigator appoints grand jury According to a report, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury in the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump. The panel has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations. The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer. US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow. The investigation is said to focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign. Mueller was also reportedly scrutinizing Trump's private and business lives more and more. The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator has personally focused on Trump and is investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair. The primary role of grand juries is to review existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges. Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers. They are usually involved when the cases are larger and more controversial. The process always takes place behind closed doors. The panel can also be called in by the public prosecutor's office to summon people for questioning under oath. According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued relating to the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. People involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said. They should also provide documents. In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation. Legal experts said Thursday evening on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary. However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will ultimately be involved in deciding whether to indict. However, the appointment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump. Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents. "The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said. The issue gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about." His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement he was unaware of the grand jury. But they also usually work in secret, he emphasized. The White House supports any measures that "fairly" expedite the work of the special counsel. Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation. There is no reason to assume that anything has changed, the statement said. Mueller was only installed after Trump fired Comey. Because of this expulsion, allegations against Trump had been raised that he wanted to obstruct justice. Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The President is under a lot of pressure over the investigation. According to US media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff. That sparked speculation that Trump might want to fire Mueller. Unlike an independent special counsel for Congress, such as in the Watergate affair involving late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the President's urging. Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step. Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would make firing the special counsel more difficult.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg floating in Antarctica In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the ice shelf. This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday. The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and covers an area of 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years until it has melted. With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades. It poses no danger to humans. According to researchers, it is unclear to what extent climate change played a role in the break-off of the iceberg. Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background. According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming. The colossus that has now broken off was previously part of the Larsen C Ice Shelf. Ice shelves float on the sea and are fed by large glaciers. It grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly. The Larsen C Ice Shelf lies south of South America near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. To the north of this ice shelf, the growth/breakdown balance was disturbed a few years ago. A complete ice shelf has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen. There is some evidence that the Larsen C Ice Shelf is also in danger, because the leading edge has never retreated as far as it is currently. In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point. The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels because they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it yields after melting itself. However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain away much faster than before. That could eventually raise sea levels, but only by a small amount, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas). According to AWI, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica at almost 50,000 square kilometers. It is up to 700 meters thick at the transition from the mainland and around 200 meters at the front edge to the open ocean. There it breaks off regularly. "Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of UK Swansea University. "This is the furthest drop since records began," he said. There is debate among scientists as to whether the Larsen C Ice Shelf will grow again or whether it will be in long-term decline and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable." But this development will take decades. Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades. This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America. According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula has receded by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s. The increase in temperature contributed to the decrease. The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house rate for staff Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to leave the association in order to become more attractive. Just before the summer break, the district council approved 41 new jobs in the administration. More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann. Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them. Apprenticeships at the district are obviously very popular. Around 620 applications were received for the places to be allocated this year. Nevertheless, the district still lacks staff to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks. There are currently 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district. Doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff are sought after. The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the district council together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration. According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for recruiting and developing personnel". The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner. The CDU, FDP and UWG demand that the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for career changers and include a training offensive. That sounds like a good approach. Because the district is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown. Other cities poach good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions. There is talk of a real "competition between public employers". In addition, there are a large number of employees who retire due to illness or old age. So it's high time to act so that no more positions remain unfilled. But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU parliamentary group, goes beyond the joint application with his party. He recently caused a big surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the cap on personnel costs and amazed the other parties. Völker wants all options to be reviewed that allow for a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association. "If we don't come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should work with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns belonging to the district - to work towards an in-house tariff," says Völker. In doing so, the CDU is attempting to pay employees and civil servants better than the collective bargaining system for the public sector actually provides. The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of service. But the tasks of the district have grown more and more in recent years. Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law. Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Climbs and Trials Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights. Three friendly guides were available for this purpose. The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours. The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra. The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim. Viewpoints followed, some on towers, from which one could see far across the Palatinate Forest and the plains in front of it. In between there were always longer climbs, which were rewarded with long trials. On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt. Viewpoint after viewpoint lined up again, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs. On the last two days, many meters of altitude were announced again. Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inns brought welcome breaks. In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium. Neustadt was also headed for. After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters in altitude, the group got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - in terms of sport and culture.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports In the future, will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting their way across the stadium lawn, sweating through all kinds of weather? The fact is: E-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included. The first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognized this. VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game. "We hope that this will inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann. He is certain "that a number of clubs will get on board this train". The world football association FIFA is organizing the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London next weekend, in which gamers from different clubs will compete against each other. In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have all qualified. Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports. The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual soccer players. "Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, so that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones. With prominent e-sports players under contract, one could be present online in these markets far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year. What exactly is it about? In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at competitive level. As in normal sport, leagues have long been established in which professionals compete against each other. And at the Asian Games 2022, e-sports are already part of the official program. But is it even a real sport? For many, the idea will certainly take some getting used to. Ingo Froboese also grappled with the question for a long time. For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes. It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and the ability to react quickly. Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition. "The fit player is a good player." But Froboese also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue". Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classic sports are missing in the scene. The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports. The players travel internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers. A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports. In 2016, 50 million euros were turned over in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments. In three years, sales should be 130 million. That's not much compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga. However, e-sports are "not far removed from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants. Internationally, many countries are already further along. Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports. Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports bookmaker Unikrn. A lot is also happening in Europe. E-sports have been introduced as a subject in a Norwegian school, says Froboese. In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the first division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department. "In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann. Just falling into nostalgia and glorifying the old days is no longer enough today. It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market. "We live in a digitized world," agrees Dutt. "You can't just stick to the fact that football is the only thing that stays the way it always was."
Farewell to poisoned eggs - the egg alternatives for cooking and baking Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal surrounding poisoned eggs. Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all eggs out of the sale throughout Germany. Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini lame It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was able to captain the Audi Cup. FC Bayern believes the Confederation Cup winner can have a great season - extra motivation doesn't hurt. Something was different in his place in the dressing room, Joshua Kimmich saw it immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very, very small. But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put the bandage assigned to him on his arm. "The coach didn't announce it," said the Confederation Cup winner after his first assignment as Bayern captain. Well, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli. But Kimmich could also interpret the sign from the coach. Arturo Vidal, eight years older than him, was not chosen as captain in the C-Elf, which consisted of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just returned from vacation. One likes to hand out sweets to those who one trusts a lot, who one wants to keep in a good mood. So anyone who has been chosen to inherit from Lahm can only use a little extra motivation. Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility". On Wednesday, the 22-year-old raced across the field as a mini-lame. Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on his arm did the rest. And anyway, in this starting formation, Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the helm best. He gave instructions, tried to steer the uncoordinated troops. He saw the big picture while many others were preoccupied with themselves. Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches, come hell or high water to build on the achievements of the Asia trip (it only worked to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not attracting negative attention in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey. Anyway, that worked quite well. Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently. The well-known Napoli-Sturm often found it difficult, and Süle also tried a few times to build up the game successfully. His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "wasn't what we had hoped for". But he also put in a decent performance on his debut. Change of game, change of pace: "I was also brought in for this style". How unusual this Bayern world is for the newcomers was evident after the game. Rudy, for example, didn't give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but at least six or seven. After a few crisp statements, Kimmich said goodbye to his new teammates. There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I've already noticed what's going on here. At Bayern you just have to win every game". After all, he no longer has to teach the newcomers.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB women Austria's best-known footballer tweeted shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB women all the best. The Bayern legionnaire is practically a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is rooting for our ladies. The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot. Our ladies could also use the famous Bayern Dusel.
Company satisfied with Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate: Economy praises Wissing's pace The relationship between the state and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate. This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) has been in office. When asked on TV, chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister. Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, all of which Lemke blocked". Natus sees the greatest reversal in infrastructure policy: Closing the gap in Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the state's list of priorities. The ministry is hoping for a planning approval procedure before the end of this year, and the building permit should be in place by 2021. The western bypass of Trier, which is a priority in the Federal Transport Routes Plan, also plays a role in the state's plans. The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann. Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies. As suggested by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been falling for ten years. In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK. The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master craftsman bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach. A bonus of 1000 euros is planned for passing the master craftsman's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's training. But the country's homework list remains long. With the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the state lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, general manager of the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce. Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state office for mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far. The Chamber of Industry and Commerce is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices. CDU faction deputy Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the state is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed. Frank Natus is also expecting a concept from the state on how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region. The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering. In 2016, regional companies only gave the grid supply a grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey. They complained about faltering internet connections and crashes. Ex-Economics Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind. The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left after four months due to disagreements.
The raft on the Isar has this message on Saturday The city wants to protect the Isar. So that visitors to the Isar can also take part, a raft with a special message will travel through Munich tomorrow, Saturday. Anyone who is drawn to the Isar again on Saturday will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke. And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists. But the building department wants to clarify. On the raft you can see a large information banner. It shows a mountain of rubbish. The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to visitors to the Isar. With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection should be sharpened. The raft already crossed the Isar last summer and this year there are further campaigns and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and the laughter against suffering Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the bulbous noses of his characters are his trademark. Even at 85, the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film. His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world". Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 to Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires. In the early years as an artist, he struggled through, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him. "The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said. After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world. Even in China, Mordillo found many fans. The artist was repeatedly inspired by cities. Large, plump Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow. According to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table early in the morning and works almost ten hours a day. His droll figures continue to be widely distributed around the world in the form of calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches. He has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters for the past six years. The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a centipede as an opponent. His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to hit cinema screens in 2019. "I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," says Mordillo. The screenplay is not written by him. That's why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
The town of Geisa in the Rhön region of Thuringia is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year. The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival. Grocers, guilds, traders, vagabonds or a lansquenet camp should be experienced in the city center on these days.
In the thunderstorm: pile-up on the A8: many injured Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a pile-up. There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams - and onlookers. Around 20 people were injured in a pile-up on the Stuttgart-Munich autobahn (A8) late Thursday afternoon. According to initial information from the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, crashed into each other. No information was initially available on the exact number of people injured. A police spokesman said the injuries were minor to moderate. A large contingent of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident. The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich. In the direction of Munich, a backlog of around ten kilometers formed. As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the oncoming lane - by numerous onlookers. The fire brigade wrote down the license plate numbers of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties. Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing. There was a collision between a car transporter and a car. A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group is testing "comfort check-in" It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced at least once: You sit on the train and sleep, not suspecting anything. Or you are engrossed in your work and just have a brilliant idea. And then: puff. The conductor comes and wakes you up roughly or pulls the passenger out of the workflow. ticket control. But the days of interruptions will soon be over. Deutsche Bahn is currently testing conductorless ticket inspection. You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thereby validate the ticket. Test operations are currently running on two routes. "If the offer arrives, we will expand it. It will then probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway spokesman. "Comfort check-in" is what Deutsche Bahn calls ticket validation without a conductor. In order to be able to use it, however, a few requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or tablet. And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway. You also have to have bought it via the Deutsche Bahn app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway. And lastly, you need a seat reservation. Because "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets". A button for electronic validation then appears for the test customers. The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y. If the train conductor comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger with an already validated online ticket is sitting there. So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent. The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers. "If you want to travel relaxed without having our train attendants check your tickets, you can simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator. This allows passengers to organize their travel time on the train more personally," says Michael Peterson, Board Member for Marketing at DB Fernverkehr. Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs". Anyone who often travels by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances. Because you often do not have all the documents with you that you need to validate online tickets, but in any case one of the passengers does not have them with you. Either the credit card or the identity card or another document that you have to show is missing. The consequences are endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or the large area and delays in checking your own tickets, and ultimately takes the time away from the conductor to take care of other matters. Only a small number of test customers can use the new service. And that only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections. Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the bit gallery The bit gallery moves people, although it's still a long way from being built. But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since it was first presented in 2009. The topic hardly leaves anyone cold. The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Friend of the People Bitburg". While some say about the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), on the other hand: "Nobody needs it" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz). While the supporters count on a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed dry. What's more, the gallery is being planned on exactly the same site as the farmers' market hall, where 13 direct marketers will offer their products. This will come to an end when the construction work begins. The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - facing Bede Square with the option of sitting outside. Simone Zimmer: "We've been shopping in the farmers' market almost weekly for many years. Mainly our eggs, but we also love the delicious cakes from the country women. We've also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves. We wish we could do it during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer. There are other cities too. The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting." Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent. But that shouldn't be exactly low with the new project." Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg? Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous. There are already enough of those in our city. You can see how many shops have been empty here - some for months and years. However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved, because the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly from the producer and are also inexpensive Shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer. It's a shame, there are almost no specialist shops anymore and what's left of them will probably disappear." Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't go together for me. And the gallery doesn't fit in Bitburg. Above all: Where should the farmers' market hall go during the construction period? The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the Bitburg Will the gallery actually come at some point. Or will the Bit-Galerie ghost manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg before that?" George Marquet: "It just won't work. And nobody needs a shopping center that's empty. In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery. But there's a farmers' market hall thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no longer any space. If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear."
For the time being, Aldi no longer sells eggs. This was announced by the corporate groups. It is a purely precautionary measure and no health impairment can be assumed, the statement said. From now on, only eggs that have been proven to be negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice agents may be delivered to Aldi. Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
Campaign started: more than 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covered With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday) on Friday. Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday. At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign. "Too nice for us. Or?", the makers of the campaign have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel. "We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday. "But we are using this measure to get your attention. And to make it clear that some things are better than they appear. Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens, we care about the beauty and attractiveness of our city very much well know." The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say. "It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point". After all, it is in competition with other municipalities. The city of Bad Honnef is spending a mid-five-digit amount on its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara discusses retirements and promotions in the officer corps. So also this week. At first glance, this is a normal process. But nothing is routine for Turkey's armed forces a year on from the attempted coup. The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's office. The five deputy prime ministers and the ministers for defence, interior, justice and foreign affairs now also took part in the deliberations chaired by the head of government. This meant that the civilians in the YAS were in the majority. The government is tightening the reins on the military. Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed. Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals. More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt. 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the attempted coup have been tried in Ankara since this week. The day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempted coup as a "godsend" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces. But does Erdogan really have the army under control? At the end of February, the newspaper "Hurriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort at military headquarters". The newspaper wrote that there were concerns among the general staff about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers. In any case, the cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues. In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7,395 civil servants fired by decree, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers. It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military. The generals used to be considered the real rulers of the country. They staged a coup three times, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order. After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union. Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving the Islamization of the armed forces. In the magazine "Vocal Europe" an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup for fear of persecution warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists". If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold. In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the operational readiness of the Turkish army. The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say NATO diplomats.
Ministry wants to renovate the route for the Rennsteig shuttle In recent months there have been repeated arguments about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle - now things should be done very quickly. Before the end of the year, work is to be carried out on the dilapidated route on which the tourist train runs. In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route is to begin before the end of this year. "With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the state is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Secretary of State for Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt. He estimated the cost of repairing the route at around 2.5 million euros. The state takes over 75 percent of this sum. The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl. The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as the operator have already agreed on the technical details. "The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated," said Sühl. The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years. This means that the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017. The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations, which is particularly popular with tourists. In the course of a pilot operation in the past few months, a test was carried out to determine whether the route was used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future. The route is also in parts very dilapidated.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg The fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were the last of the Blumberg schools to be released for vacation and secondary school. In the future, three of the discharge students will go to grammar school and four to secondary school. Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public to the Biesental community center in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening. As a symbol for the dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken yard, but is then released into the wild. In addition, the lively group performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Yard". Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let his hens incubate it. Instead of a chick, a little eagle came out. But the hope of making a chicken out of him was dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared. After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's rehearsal. The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who wore top hats. The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte. The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to them. But he will never be like a chicken. His destiny is to be free. She wished every fourth grader that they felt accepted in their new school. Words of thanks followed to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly stepped in when there were bottlenecks in teaching, and the parents' representatives. The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher. She is very reluctant to let her students go after two years of teaching because it was a really great time. In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders. At the end, all the students sang a song about summertime and vacation time. The children erupted with great joy. Eight first graders have already signed up for the new school year.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected need to know now How exactly does the software update take place? Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign? The most important questions and answers at a glance. At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars. They are intended to improve the exhaust behavior of cars in the Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6 emission classes. This does not apply to Euro 4 diesel or worse. Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments: Is the new campaign mandatory? No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary. "The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have cheat software," says Anja Smetanin. The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting. How and from when will customers be informed about updates? The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date. Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone affected. If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done as part of it. How long should the conversions take in total? "It's hard to say," says Smetanin. That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure. "Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily when it comes to the environment." How long should the update take? The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop. It can be more time consuming to get an appointment. What do drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do? The ACE advises to wait and see. According to Smetanin, foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit. Is there now a massive drop in prices for Euro 4 cars? The ACE fears that. But in the regions where driving bans are imminent. In rural areas there has not been any loss in value for older diesels. The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Honors The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington's most glamorous events. The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political. One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest. LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center. As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees this year. The awards will be presented in early December. Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania. Lear, who has become known for his progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not be attending the gala. He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect—even defund—the arts and human rights, and that weighs on me." Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to get her point of view clear. Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural facility in the US capital. Past honorees include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living in Roland Wacker, Haslach's master builder, will retire next year. The position has already been advertised - but suitable applicants are rare. Wacker has been the city master builder for 31 years. And he still enjoys his work a lot, as he conveys in the press conference. He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor. At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has met the requirement profile. The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible. In this way, there should still be enough time for induction, taking into account the regular notice periods. Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant qualifications. The city definitely wants to keep this function. If she were no longer able to fill this out, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice. But being close to the citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports that there is a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens. In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride. "We make the city worth living in," he says with certainty about the building authority and its employees. But there will also be a variety of projects on the agenda in the future: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated. The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue. The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker. "All in all, great tasks await my successor. Working here is fun." In terms of design, there is a great deal of leeway for a master builder. With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, you can react very flexibly to many things. "You can do a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by residents and visitors. Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city master builder. In any case, the city master builder bears a great deal of responsibility. He is the client, "in the end everything here runs through my desk". When it comes to support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years. Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We're looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay." Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further development of the city. According to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and building planning law. The city building office is responsible for building construction and civil engineering, land use planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the city's properties, city depot with building yard and city gardening as well as the lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: southern railway line blocked According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines. These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped. The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours. A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses near the crime scene. "It goes far beyond a rascal prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA. The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic. In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for the rail replacement service, the perpetrators could also face penalties from rail customers. Overall, a "considerable" sum can be assumed, said the spokesman. The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway line was able to run without hindrances. Almost ten passenger trains were canceled on Friday morning, two of which affected long-distance traffic. Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed. According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced. Insulators and pylons were also damaged.
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky. The pilots flew from Seattle, Washington state, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and stretched across the United States in the shape of a Dreamliner, that's several thousand kilometers. The action lasted 18 hours and a minute. Being on the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner. The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines. Boeing had made such advertisements before. The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin before elections with a certain concern. Just no disruptive fire from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners. This has changed fundamentally since Martin Schulz has led the party. Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have observed the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror. What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even begin to be described with headwind. They were low blows. And one after the other. After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens. "This shows once again that Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND). The surprising resignation of a Greens deputy has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis. Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition. The Greens federal manager Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to give up her mandate. The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters. Elke Twesten must give back her mandate immediately," said the Green Party's national secretary and campaign manager to the editorial network Germany (RND). "It can't all be true," sighed an SPD campaigner when the new bad news reached party headquarters on Friday morning. Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is after the Green MP Elke Twesten converted to the CDU without his own government majority.It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.And nobody knows what will happen next The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March. A black eye, nothing more, the comrades reassured themselves at the time. After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different. That was it then too - and everything got much worse.The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stagger, the Düsseldorf-P lead the party smoothly. In the weeks that followed, the comrades struggled to get themselves back on their feet. Then, when they had just taken heart, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg. And with him came the next low blow. Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his aura that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning. And because in crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong. Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival. So now also Stephan Weil. The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been criticized for the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board. Lousy poll numbers were added. Despite this, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to set accents in the federal government in recent weeks. The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not go unnoticed by comrades close to Martin Schulz. They allowed him to do so because they hoped Weil would stabilize the party. Now the exact opposite could happen. Basically, Weil is not to blame for the internal party dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens. And certainly not Schulz. For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed. Her anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the renegade MP Twesten. "It is unbearable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND). Ms Twesten was not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued. The logical consequence would be for her to give up her mandate. Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, complains about an "undemocratic manoeuvre". "The will of the voters was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who is leading the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal elections, the RND. "Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result," Oppermann continued. He asked for the background to be clarified. I want to know whether there was more or whether there were further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for town center III If you want to renovate your house that is getting on in years, you can soon get support from the state. Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen. At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far. There have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen since 1991. At that time, in redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding. In redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent. For Schindler, the renovations so far are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote internal development and not just open up new building areas. On April 4th, information was received from the Regional Council in Karlsruhe that there would be a redevelopment area III. The funding amounts to 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the state and the rest from the municipality of Empfingen. How is a redevelopment area created? According to Schindler, they will investigate where the "really old" houses are. However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to be renovated at all. If necessary, the area boundaries could then be shifted again. STEG were represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel. Keller presented the contents of the federal and state program "Social City", under which the renovations would then be carried out. The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure. The measures would be carried out on a property-related basis, i.e. per property. The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute. The approval period for the funding runs from January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026. However, the inventory would first be carried out by September of this year, during which those involved in the redevelopment area would receive a questionnaire to fill out. If possible, the resolution on the articles of association should be made in November or December so that the renovations can begin in the coming year. Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations. It's about evaluating the urban planning deficits and deciding when to renovate and to what extent. A redevelopment note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property. Pietzschmann would come to Empfingen himself and get an idea of the situation, she promised. Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved. That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays. The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property Sheet", which deals with the structural condition and the renovation intentions, among other things. In the gray questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Form", information can be given on the size, layout and occupants of a living space. The blue "operating form" only needs to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building. However, as Gotzel pointed out, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding. In addition, new construction measures are not eligible. Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the funding works according to the "first come, first served" principle. Funding cannot be "reserved" for later. At the end, photos of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the renovation "palatable" to those present.
TC BW Neuss faces a tricky task Leader of the second tennis league takes on Suchsdorfer SV, third in the table. TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will play third-placed Suchsdorfer SV in Kiel tomorrow at 11 a.m. Despite the still flawless record after five games, the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality. In any case, team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent. "It's a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation. I think the team is very good, especially in the back positions." Above all, the imports from the far north ensure class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV. "Their Danes and Finns can even refer to appearances in the Davis Cup. And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark). "As always, it will be difficult for us. You also need a good portion of luck." The Neuss team for the trip up north is practically ready. Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blau-Weiss. If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance of the season. The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday. But he should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both from the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina . After his two wins against the Alster club last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team. If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from Marius Zay's coaching staff will fill the squad.
How America can damage OMV Donald Trump didn't seem really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening. "In its haste to enact the law," Congress packed in a few "unconstitutional provisions," he said. The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels fumed at the US advance. After all, the draft provides for penalizing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU. Since then, investors in the local OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been correspondingly concerned. The threat is huge. However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement. In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order. He has twelve weapons to choose from. "Die Presse" looked at which ones the group could fend off and which ones could really hurt it.
Roll backwards: the city is hiring 46 kitchen helpers. The city is once again organizing the day-care center itself. With fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team. The clock is turned back in the municipal day-care centers. As of September 1st, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal day-care centers (Kitas) on its own. For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy". Cooking will continue to be done off-site: a caterer will take on this task and deliver chilled freshly cooked food. The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime. In the last day-care center year, 2,800 children sat at the tables, and the need is constantly growing. "Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center," explains Pommeranz. "The offer also applies to 35-hour care if the children stay until 2 p.m.." From September 1st, 46 part-time employees will be on kitchen duty: they heat the food that is delivered, add salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, serve the food, clear away, do the dishes and clean the kitchen. "The employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz. The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours. "The kitchen helpers are now part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz with satisfaction. "They are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts". Because that's what it's all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons. "The children should help to prepare the food". The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense. Also for the children. "They have a known force in the daycare, a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people". This continuity is important for the children. The cleaning of the day-care center rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff. This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the improvement in the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in a cost comparison between in-house management and outsourcing, according to the press office. And this despite the fact that 46 new part-time employees are being hired. "But these hours are not that important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday. According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstrasse, at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl's mobile phone to make a call. The 13-year-old declined the request and continued with her friends. One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but was unsuccessful. The duo fled without taking anything. The two young men were later arrested by the police. The investigation is ongoing.
Scooter overturned and damaged During the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator intentionally overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Strasse in front of property number 30, causing material damage of over 200 euros to the vehicle's panelling. The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese. Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and touched the crash barrier. On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW around 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese. In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right. The Touran driver touched the crash barrier. Property damage was caused to the car. The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued driving without paying attention to the traffic accident. According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident. The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact the police department in Stolzenau on 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger" The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse exonerates Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger. That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks. The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussions. Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the "We are Church" reform movement, told the German Press Agency after the publication that he expected the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI ., an apology. It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of the events at the time. The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that "double standards" were used when reporting on violence at the cathedral sparrows. With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; What is striking, however, is the "degree of media manipulation," according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of Italy's national bioethics committee. "The habit of naming the Catholic Church as the source of all ills is part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to accept it as normal," writes Scaraffia. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "People like to go to church and that's a godsend." She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a completely normal pedagogical tool" "to deal with cheeky children like me." She finds it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed. In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared. Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial volume "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages). "I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because none of that had anything to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg to investigate? Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were victims of assaults "with a high degree of plausibility", and 67 cathedral sparrows were sexually abused. The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases. Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the Pupils also turn out to be more violent. Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other suspects, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence". In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger. Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against those in charge of the Regensburg cathedral sparrows" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger. For one thing, many students emphasize his "humanity." On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became violent when a cathedral sparrow did not perform top musically. As his biographer, how do you rate this final report? Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from cover to cover, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all. Just eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse. The violent excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside of his sphere of influence. At most, one can accuse him of finding out about it too late or not taking the first hints seriously enough. The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "a better world". The vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger excellent marks, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly served the boys with cake , biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by bunches of children". Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbursts of anger. Years ago he admitted that he not only banged chairs and threw the bunch of keys on the floor, but also slapped the ears and pulled the hair or ears of overly cheeky boys, deeply regretting it and apologizing for it. To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike. Do you also know such chastisement methods? Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968. I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school. Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violent excesses in preschool, these are of course trifles. One wonders if it's not more about his fame and his role as Benedict XVI's brother. has to do with the fact that a lot of the media just rushed at him. Many who never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope. But the truth is: The report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect! In connection with the report, the media reported a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen. Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report? Michael Hesemann: Definitely no. Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral conductor. Not even the parents were in the know. "I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one affected person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me." The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent out of shame. If they didn't even confide in their parents and siblings, then certainly not in a choir director, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators, so to speak. How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the cases of abuse? Michael Hesemann: A student who was interviewed put it like this: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator in question. I think it .. It's also really absurd to assume that boys of all people opened up to him more urgently or clearly or earlier than to their parents, boarding school directors, tutors, etc. That you talked to him about sex ... - unthinkable." The report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the affected students and/or their environment confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation". As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must be acquitted of any complicity. So he cannot be accused of not having prevented or reported him. There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as unfortunately has happened in some cases. There was a lot to be read in the media about "violent excesses" at the Regensburg Domspatzen. The former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report. Does he have to live with this accusation? Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger. But that in turn is an abuse of the report. Because there is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let's say, other allegations. In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen. The whole terrible spanking pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly as a result, all happened at the preschools in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed. But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium. As the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" was taboo. One was only happy to have escaped it and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions. What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium? Michael Hesemann: There was discipline there, but no sadistic violence. And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, for whom the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence". The only thing that remains is the accusation of having looked the other way. But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two time periods in which he was told about the conditions in the preschool. The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and (according to the witness) he didn't want to hear anything about what was going on at a school where he just didn't work or was responsible, and then again only around 1993. Georg locked up Ratzinger in front of the states consistently ears? Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces. In it he points out "that caning will continue to be practiced in the pre-school". In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action. That was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria. Before that, they happened in a legal gray area, as any of us probably remember. It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded. But you can't say he always looked the other way. That's just not true. In 1980, caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria. Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time. How do you see it? Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards. The princess is right about that. But of course that doesn't apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also doesn't apply to the atrocities and violence committed against innocent children's souls in preschool, that goes far beyond what was usual at the time. It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked through. But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because none of this had anything to do with him. His methods of discipline and punishment, such as slapping, hair and ear pulling, were widespread in the 1970s. When corporal punishment was outlawed, he strictly adhered to it. What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"? Did the subject of corporal punishment also come up? Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, where the cathedral sparrows only played a supporting role. Nevertheless, I am by no means concealing the fact that he led a strict regime there. But it also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to create a world-class institution out of the Regensburger Domspatzen, which until then had been more nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991). Biscuits and sweets alone don't turn stubborn boys into great singers, and any success, regardless of the field, always requires discipline, passion and self-control. What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger as when talking about your book? Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I have always experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally kind, deeply religious and kind-hearted person, of whom one cannot imagine that he was even one could harm a fly. I regularly see how many former cathedral sparrows still keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family. Those who still don't forgive him for being harsh on them are clearly in the minority. Today, most cathedral sparrows are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music. And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect who they still look up to today and who they downright adore. And please, once again very clearly: everything he is accused of is educational methods that were the order of the day at the time. We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time. But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother. The evil intent behind it is all too obvious. Because the report that has just been published exonerates him. Now decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man, who has done a great job and without whom no one outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be left in peace.
