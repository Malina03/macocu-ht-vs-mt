Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where digging is now underway for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Allotment gardeners cultivate what was once farmers' land.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to light.
It's annoying when maps are not up to date.
Everyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass knows this.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, a service of the Bavarian Geoportal of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but that is precisely why they are very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how towns and communities in the circulation area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognisable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large general map for towns and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Survey Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Their client: Napoleon.
The French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of an area-wide map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found, like all others, on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison of past and present is most impressive when looking at the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the 1856 map.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was drawn up, in 1877.
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling were concentrated around 1856 along what is now Plinganserstrasse, which was not named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants' uprising against Austria in 1705, until 1878.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: Zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered parcels from the so-called "primitive survey" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots of land are no longer occupied by farmers - but by allotment gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" site.
A large green area is emerging to the north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was indeed still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original location sheet, one reads in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße.
The Munich district insane asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established there in 1858/59.
From 1872, the institution was run by Dr. Bernhard von Gudden - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has studied the asylum for an exhibition.
Initially, there was room for 280 patients, but later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for building the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer asylum, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Casa Don Bosco children's home was built - architecturally based on the original building of the asylum, which was destroyed in bombing raids during the Second World War.
Around 1856, Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz", Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where preliminary work is taking place these days and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line will take place on 5 April 2017.
Use the slider to compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill in the hole at Marienhof.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a success and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac went to see for themselves.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs at the Schwendemann family's Rechtgrabenhof farm.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, looks after 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals, and accommodates holiday guests in five flats.
According to Schwendemann, "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the marketing channel for his cows' milk that has no alternative.
Only regional products are served to the holiday guests.
As he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementarily important".
I cannot farm profitably on such steep land.
The grassland makes for a lot of work, he said, and much of it has to be worked with a brush scythe.
"We have to struggle with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann emphasised.
He took over his parents' farm in 2003 and manages it without chemical pesticides and fertilisers, even though he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
With costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers needed to be supported.
It is hoped that this could drag out the afforestation of the land for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to take their farm further," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised over subsidies
A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants through the pasture fence subsidy.
The area kept open thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half was funded by Leader and one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers with 12,610 euros to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac emphasised: "You are doing a really good job, you can't do it without farmers and countrywomen".
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Maintenance Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows for state funding of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the existence of a subsidised area designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be cultivable by tractors (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach pasture fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently underway, who would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The area to be kept open corresponds to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This is the result of a study by scientists at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is reasonably on schedule", according to Fred Heinze, head of the building yard.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since there is a lot hidden underground that is not indicated in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly obstructs the construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
"The ignorance of drivers in the face of red lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
No Davis Cup reform: Best-of-five continues
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal to play Davis Cup singles in only two winning sets, which is revolutionary for this sport, was not supported by the required two-thirds majority by a razor-thin margin.
The five-set classics, which are often very long but therefore also very much appreciated, will therefore remain in the traditional competition.
63.54 per cent of member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's target was only narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not approve the full reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the competitions, he added.
The proposal to hold the final at a neutral venue was not even put to the vote after many objections.
Only comparatively minor details are new from 2018: for example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in terms of training grounds etc. will be eased and the players will have to attend fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electric thausendassa Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
Yet he has so far failed to mention that some of the customers have already cancelled their non-binding reservations.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed another, less glamorous figure for the first time when announcing the latest quarterly financial statement: that of cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just starting to be delivered.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will refund the 1000 euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts that there were currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders to date could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie with demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - it should be 500,000, and in 2020 one million.
The demand is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently being added every day.
Anyone who orders a Model 3 today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, at maximum capacity without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the mountain church's anniversary, an invitation is extended to a serenade on the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 pm.
Due to its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius grounds are a popular place to linger.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in a document in the Württemberg Book of Documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the hill with the parish church of Tumlingen on it, together with the bailiwick" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the deed, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a manorial farm on the Tumlingen hill, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, the "Berg" was the third, manorial settlement core of the village, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can just be recognised today in the townscape of Tumlingen.
Old maps from around 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage developed from the early medieval right to own a church.
A lord who built a church, equipped it and staffed it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath it.
This was connected with the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then rang out for the first time in 1692, but later had to be surrendered during the Second World War in 1942.
During the 30 Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and pews and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower in two and half of it collapsed.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to 750 years of church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffige Rentnern" (retired people) take care of the Hilarius grounds as Dieter Dockhorn's successors.
As organisers, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth Serenade on Sunday, 16 July, in the old cemetery at the St. Hilarius Chapel.
It will be performed by the combo of the Kepler Grammar School in Freudenstadt and will feature speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann, head of the village, will give the closing address.
The programme begins at 4.30 pm.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the serenade, there will be a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organisers emphasise the fantastic view.
The serenade will only take place in dry weather.
The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to the preservation of local history, as serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval for wind turbines examined
"Boisheim wehrt sich" (Boisheim defends itself) sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" (Boisheim defends itself) has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was granted unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone in Viersen on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is possible in principle, but at the same time the concentration zone has the effect of excluding the use of wind energy for the rest of the town.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "covered in vegetation".
A few days earlier, the town of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the missing planning law requirement, the notice of approval issued is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich" (Boisheim defends itself).
The current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the town council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This rules out the granting of a permit for the erection of wind turbines at this location under planning law".
The district confirms receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesperson explained.
The district is taking them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they will probably not lead to the procedure being stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a site on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen holds an indirect stake, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the 65-hectare site.
With the erection of the four wind turbines, it should be possible to cover the electricity needs of about 11,400 households - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all households in Viersen.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as an investment in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor collide: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road remained closed for several hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving her car in the direction of Bogel, accompanied by her 53-year-old mother.
City and traders plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalza residents and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to shop in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend is intended to sensitise customers to what their own town has to offer beyond the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is planned.
In addition, local companies will present their apprenticeship places.
In addition, the shops in the city centre will invite shoppers to "midnight shopping".
The campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
According to Christian König, advertising spots on the radio, an internet video and printed bags are being prepared to draw attention to the campaign weekend.
The city administration and the trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Fountain Festival including an open Sunday, talks with all tradespeople and innkeepers to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, new or renewed customer potential is to be tapped.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals have also lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone has to contribute to revitalising the city centre - including landlords, businesses throughout the city and associations.
König said in the spring that a network was needed to overcome the lethargy that had become widespread in some areas.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK centre in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian towns are participating for the first time in the third nationwide "Heimat-Shoppen" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day is intended to "promote the appreciation of local trade and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The campaign under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her immediate environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
A gas explosion occurred in the school building during construction work.
New people were also injured.
Two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously, in a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis.
According to the fire service, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
One person who was initially missing was also later recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected that the cause of the accident was work on a gas pipe.
Only a few people were staying in the Minnehaha Academy building during the holiday season.
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf again relies on a colourful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with a remnant of the Wall and a kebab stand in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
An open vintage Mercedes is parked in front of it, in which the Rhinemaidens pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" production.
The three Rhinemaidens - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully, as they did in "Rheingold".
They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the boot in Hollywood style and give the riotous clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavyweight boxer about him.
The scene when he kills Siegfried is brutal.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) is also killed.
The audience thanks the ensemble with loud applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bowed modestly with his hands forming a Merkel rhombus, received rapturous applause.
There was great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which appeared on stage for the first time - once again in casual leisure wear in view of the intense heat.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Whereas in 2013 he had to endure a roar of catcalls, five years later there was great jubilation in which the occasional "boo" was drowned out.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been pleased.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a certain way," she had told dpa shortly before the performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but had also grown to understand his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
You work in several places during your volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Menge: Usually in Steinfurt at the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven at the Möbelbrücke.
And I have already worked in the open all-day at the school.
What are your experiences with this?
Menge: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late-career volunteer.
How come?
Menge: I graduated from high school.
And then, let's say, successfully dropped out of a civil engineering course.
I realised that it was wrong for me and that I wanted to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Do a social year, you get an insight, you can see what it's really like on the ground, maybe in a hot spot.
And was it like that?
Menge: I gained some great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do social work training at the Youth Welfare Office in Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different places of work during your voluntary service?
Menge: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it in anything from an old people's home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me, it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what appealed to me.
I was able to recognise my own strengths and see how things really work.
Is it different from studying civil engineering?
Menge: Of course, here it's not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, each of whom has a completely different story behind them.
Whether it's a refugee or a young person who has been taken away from their family - you always have to deal with them individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's life.
Community council wants community room
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the Fluorn-Winzeln community council decides to set up a community room in the future senior citizens' housing complex.
Before the discussion, there was an important piece of information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property had been signed, reported Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time until the land, which until now belonged to the parish, is owned by the municipality, there is now no longer any obstacle to the planning of the project, which is to be carried out by a private investor.
Instead, there is a discussion regarding a community room.
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to accommodate the community.
He would provide a living space on the ground floor - about 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind that such a community space should not be a meeting place only for the residents of the senior-friendly housing, but should be open to the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was made last autumn by providing funds for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
Tjaden reports that the establishment of a community room would be eligible for 60 per cent of 30 per cent subsidies.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to put a spoke in his wheel, the proposed resolution states that both gable roofs - which are based on the surrounding buildings - and monopitch roofs - which reduce the eaves height and make the building more economical - would be possible.
Wilfried Sohmer is not the only one who thinks this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: it passes the committee unanimously.
It is not so easy with the community room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many buildings she owns, which are not making much progress, but she says that they are now going out on a limb with the community room: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the community room - but absolutely against municipal participation.
She sees this as a hidden subsidy to people who are already wealthy or even to foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the purchase of the space is not a subsidy, but a real countervalue that can be marketed in case of doubt.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly found three supporters.
Thus, with two votes against, the original programme remains, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we pass the resolution like this, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure.
Collision with car: cyclist thrown onto road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old from Langenfeld was riding his bicycle on the cycle path of Schwarzer Weg coming from Hilden at 12.20 pm.
The senior citizen wanted to cross the road at Am Buchholzer Busch.
A woman driving a car in the same direction gave him priority.
When the man from Langenfeld drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden.
The man was thrown onto the road.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
FC Bayern München must do without David Alaba and Thiago for Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup will take place without him: David Alaba has to skip the match against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season with personnel worries.
Seven professionals are missing for the defending champions in the Supercup against the cup winners.
The personnel worries at German football record champion Bayern Munich are growing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti will also have to do without David Alaba for the clash with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat will be absent.
Ancelotti has blamed the physical state and lack of balance in his team's play for the five defeats in the past six test matches.
"We know we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It hasn't been good lately."
But the 58-year-old believes the performance will improve in the first official competitive game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German football heavyweights is drawing in the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the Harz Mountains
Germany's first "star trail" is to be built in the Harz Mountains.
It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory Association.
There has been a planetary path in Göttingen since 2003.
A "star trail" would meet the information needs of many visitors to the Harz, they said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and sporting performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and provide information about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber are possible candidates.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail will be expanded step by step.
"On the star trail, the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learn why stars have different colours or why one star shines more brightly than another even though it is much further away.
They also learn in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best visible.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can be seen clearly with the naked eye from there.
In the university town, there has been something similar to the planned star dwarf in place since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Friends Association - the Planet Trail.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gleichen municipality) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto, which has been demoted to a dwarf planet at the end point - are set up exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the Sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometres.
While it takes light about eight hours to reach Pluto from the sun, it takes pedestrians a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the nearest fixed star would still take half a year.
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were injured in an accident on the A7 motorway on Thursday afternoon, some of them seriously.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, presumably after a tyre burst.
The car skidded to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then came to rest on its roof in the grass verge.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident, some of them seriously.
During the initial treatment of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 northbound was closed for about an hour, after which traffic could be diverted past the accident site on the left lane.
Fortuna's Hoffmann: "Three-man chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive formation will bring points in Aue after the 2-2 draw against Braunschweig at the start of the season.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result as well, had it not been for the two goals conceded in the 2-2 draw against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," said the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-man defence should also be further optimised.
And the Fortunes also don't want to catch a goal from a free kick again.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the three-man backline than with the four-man backline, even after their experiences in preparation.
"I don't yet know how we will operate in Aue," said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players in the three-man backline in particular in the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite, however, is that we harmonise even better and that we don't make so many play-off mistakes in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann is also going to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could well be okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we are standing there with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I only judge the start to the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be abandoned early due to a thunderstorm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game, so to speak," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes Aue's players might even be a bit fresher as they don't have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in their bones.
"But they don't know so 100 per cent where they are at the moment," said the Fortuna centre-back.
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into Sunday's encounter at Aue's finally (almost) finished stadium as slight favourites.
"That we'll sweep them away just because we have the ambition to finish in the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is thoroughly positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overbearing".
And that is definitely not how Funkel wants his players to feel on Sunday.
Right on schedule
Work on the three bridges on the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete element was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very well on schedule, things are going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Traffic at the Freiburg Regional Council.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of rehabilitation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
Construction is scheduled to end in October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.
It is an arched bridge made of concrete clad with red red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now getting on in years.
In order to ensure its stability and traffic safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach river.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 metres long respectively.
On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach received a 1.30-metre-wide, seven-tonne bridge cap on the north side.
This is an edge reinforcement that is also used as a service road.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be installed on Friday.
The pedestrian path will then run on top of it.
The special thing about it is that it is prefabricated, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the structure in Lauterbach required special sensitivity.
This is because a fibre optic cable also runs there, to which many companies are connected.
In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed about the project by handbills.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished out first.
For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in one lane by traffic lights.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.
The whole project is financed by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful Protest with German Potato Salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left Party) are part of a broad alliance that is peacefully flying the flag on this day, because the AfD is inviting people to the "big election campaign kick-off" in the Gerolstein Rondell town hall, according to the poster.
And it is bringing well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfDers, but to demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the town picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now it takes place on the car park below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
It is a colourful picture.
And Christa Karoli, chairperson of the One World Forum and one of the main organisers, is really pleased: "It's great how many people have come together here.
There is music and lots of food, including a "traditional German potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to organise such an event and got the nod.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but was turned down there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the Laurentiuskirmes, which had already been set up.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "That's people's good right, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It does: at around 8 pm, a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, and in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the AfD chairman of Rhineland-Palatinate, Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have more patience, but there, too, it is time to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can leave - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he will give a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets classical German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and prize-winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov, for example, is principal trumpet of the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is principal trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach sounds as if in a new guise with the two, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating synthesis of the arts.
This core piece of the programme was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart says openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next'."
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was probably with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which ultimately broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine, "I've been seriously in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I was faking it?"
After their split, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's never confused or hindered me.
I've just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", however, she suffered particularly from this in her school days when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, kids told me I looked like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of yourself'."
She especially doesn't like explaining her love life to the public, "People expect you to act a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public."
Act of mourning for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, some 1000 people remembered the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) did not comment on the cause of the crash, which is still unclear.
However, she described the two pilots who perished as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old staff captain from northern Hesse had died a week ago Wednesday in Mali, West Africa.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar's St Peter's Cathedral on Thursday, accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake.
At noon, only the relatives took their leave in the church.
Afterwards, the funeral service began in the circle of family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlar residents and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and experienced in operations.
The staff captain had helped establish the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also explained: "If this crew could not avert the crash, no one could have".
Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: "The mission is dangerous.
But it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states", she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the German Armed Forces did not give any details.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement continued.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and in the process also relinquished the title of "Prince Consort".
Since Henrik had not been given the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
It is still unclear where the 83-year-old's final resting place will be.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, he had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames, he worked in the French embassy.
While his future wife always received expressions of sympathy from the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was shaky, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, which had the reputation in this country of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed content with that position and not ashamed of it.
That was two mistakes at once!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new election
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick new election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
On Friday, Weil spoke out in favour of dissolving parliament.
Earlier, the surprising resignation of a Green MP from her state parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its slim one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his parliamentary group to accept her.
This would give the CDU and FDP together 69 seats in Lower Saxony's state parliament, and the SPD and Greens 68 seats.
Until now, the ratio was reversed.
The new state parliament will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the state parliament decides to dissolve itself as soon as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on its further course of action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the state parliament withdrawing its confidence in the prime minister and electing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These options have to be examined in a legally clean way," Thümler said.
"One will calmly discuss all questions when they have been examined in a legally sound way."
Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious after all".
The politician herself stressed, "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her state parliament mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return her state parliamentary mandate, which she obtained via the Green state list, with immediate effect," state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner announced.
The parliamentary party leader of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the parliamentary group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz condemned the defection of Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MP in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Greens," the federal leader of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He said he supported Prime Minister Stephan Weil's (SPD) decision to have the state parliament quickly re-elected.
Twesten's resignation will cost the Red-Green Party a majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician, "in her wounded vanity and frustration, is putting her personal interests before the good of the state", criticised SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty game of intrigue and trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MPs to accept Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal careerism.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest party, ahead of the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Interview with the Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states post the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we know at present, a health risk is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the range - because the central role of clarifying the situation is not really being performed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my office immediately stepped in and has been in close contact with the authorities of the federal states ever since Germany became aware of the problem.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, just like the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the farms that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in case of emergency.
Is it just a lack of staff or is there also a lack of coherent responsibility?
After all, it was precisely the official controls that uncovered the case.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that consistent investigation of such incidents and handing them over to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where criminal offences may have been committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to carry out a complete investigation.
Is the regular alarmism about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated product has put producers, traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
Basically, it must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
Work on this must be done consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all responsible authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration is facing a possible end: the airline is putting the contract out to tender again.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report in the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed and subjected to quality control every two to three years.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white wrapped chocolate bars of 14 grams are distributed to passengers by flight attendants before landing each year.
Swiss did not want to give any details about the costs.
According to "Nordwestschweiz", industry insiders estimate the order volume at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary has an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are for the new tender.
But only Swiss manufacturers are being considered.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
Switzerland's largest chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for comment by sda.
Chocolate bars have been distributed by Swiss on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate trays in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the option of placing the logo two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are treated to treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers snack on chocolate from Lindt and in Economy Class chocolate from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss also distributes Chocolat Frey chocolate on short-haul flights, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Olympic discus champion Robert Harting reaches world championship final
The three-time world champion will be fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Championships elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Poland's defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres, also qualified for the final with his first attempt.
Blow against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Constance public prosecutor's office announced on Friday.
In the process, 15 suspects aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officers seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
During simultaneous raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.
German arrest warrants were issued for the two Italian suspects.
The two will therefore probably be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and extortion.
The Constance public prosecutor's office has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany since summer 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil CID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian Mafia were the main targets of the investigation.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a pub early in the morning, may also be attributed to the gang.
Weise complains about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany shows considerable deficiencies.
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis obtained by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the information, ten million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
According to the report, the data is administered by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the quality of the data had not been good in some cases.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who have long since ceased to be alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register".
According to the report, "Incorrect data entries can considerably slow down return processes".
Moreover, the statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country at all.
Such false classifications, however, "lead to a distorted debate on how to deal with people who are obliged to leave the country", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy if they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung.
According to the paper, the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and very small children - to Italy again since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, the newspaper said, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels on to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
In justification, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children has increased significantly in Italy".
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these guarantees to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic policy spokesperson of the Left Party in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with reception conditions that violate human rights and endanger the well-being of the child because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality recognises multiple willingness to donate blood at the municipal council meeting.
"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed to do this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, unselfishly at that," Mayor Karlheinz Kistner emphasised.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the blood is broken down into its components.
This means that three people can benefit from one blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK district preparedness officer.
Obviously, the move to the theatre house a few years ago had led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and received awards for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger donated half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres ten times.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the public is requested and hoped for.
Police all over Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally unknown, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives hide at holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The website www.eumostwanted has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online wanted men have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to tips after posting on the website.
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the town.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the visitor's tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council at the time.
But Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald in particular defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties in the building.
He was to be proved right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star-plus hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
With the Freudenstadt property, the group has four houses.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It is actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renovated in Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything is to be "beautifully citizen-friendly" later on, as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make it a jewel."
A swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room are part of the facilities.
Scherer emphasises that they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale inner-city level.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to position itself broadly, Scherer explains further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, says Scherer.
The city's ideas are congruent with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under one million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also being spruced up, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is being built in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia Affair: US Special Investigator Appoints Grand Jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper interpreted the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that the first subpoenas had already been issued by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is said to focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also increasingly scrutinised Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor had put Trump personally at the centre and was investigating allegations that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually called in when there are major and controversial cases.
The proceedings are always conducted behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the prosecution to subpoena people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued concerning the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting have been asked to testify, the report said.
They were also asked to provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr, Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the appointment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be called in at the end to decide whether to bring an indictment.
Nevertheless, the appointment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue, he said, gives Democrats a way to "feel good about themselves because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he was not aware of a grand jury being set up.
But the grand jury usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that would speed up the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey had said three times that the president was not under investigation.
There was no reason to believe that this had changed, the statement added.
However, Mueller was only appointed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this dismissal, accusations had been made against Trump that he had wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special congressional investigator, such as in the Watergate affair involving President Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to forestall such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills on Thursday under which the special investigator could no longer be fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
A gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has broken away from the ice shelf in West Antarctica.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tonnes and covers 5800 square kilometres, is now drifting northwards and will probably take two or three years to melt.
At 175 kilometres long and up to 50 kilometres wide, it is one of the largest ice giants researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
It poses no danger to humans.
According to researchers, it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for about 30 years, the US National Snow and Ice Research Centre (NSIDC) writes in a factual backgrounder.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-off colossus was previously part of the Larsen C Ice Shelf.
Ice shelves float on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further and further into the sea and regularly breaks off.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growing and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf had disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are indications that the Larsen C Ice Shelf is also in danger, because the leading edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting ice shelves and icebergs do not raise sea levels because they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could eventually raise sea levels, but only slightly, writes the British Antarctic Monitoring Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick, at the leading edge to the open ocean around 200 metres.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he also acknowledged.
It is a matter of debate among scientists whether the Larsen C Ice Shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades, he said.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-up of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has shrunk by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising fastest.
CDU wants staff to be paid by the house
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Shortly before the summer break, the district council voted through 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 apprentices have had their first day at work.
The apprenticeships at the district are obviously in great demand.
About 620 applications were received for the places to be filled this year.
Nevertheless, the district still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled positions in the district of Mettmann.
Among others, doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff are being sought.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, would now like to take the initiative in the district council and counter the lack of skilled workers in the administration.
The parties want the administration to "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way, they say.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
After all, the district has to deal with staffing problems that were unknown in the past.
Other cities are poaching good civil servants and employees and offering more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a veritable "competition among public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
So it is high time to act to prevent even more jobs from going unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU parliamentary group, and his party go even further than the joint motion.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the capping of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to leave the municipal employers' association to be examined.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should strive for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns belonging to the district," Völker said.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is actually provided for in the collective agreement for the public service.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only given if one moves to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the district have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, District Administrator Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Climbs and trials
Nine bikers from Weiler, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Northern Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to St Michael's Chapel above Deidesheim.
This was followed by vantage points, some on towers, from which one could see far across the Palatinate Forest and the offshore plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day, we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saltworks and the Wurstmarkt festival.
Once again, viewpoint followed viewpoint, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days there were again many metres in altitude.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment huts provided welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also visited.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had experienced the Palatinate Forest at its best - both sportingly and culturally.
Consoles instead of grass - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in future instead of sweating their way across the stadium turf in wind and weather?
The fact is that e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees.
The first Bundesliga clubs have also recognised this and are becoming increasingly involved in this field.
VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope this will inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "many more clubs will get on board this train".
This coming weekend, the world football association FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have also qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs are trying to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online on these markets far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are played on a competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long since been established in which professionals compete against each other.
And e-sports are already part of the official programme for the 2022 Asian Games.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly takes some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also grappled with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction time.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit gamer is a good gamer."
Froböse also sees problems, however: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue."
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, he says, and the scene lacks the structures of classic sport.
On the positive side, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players travel internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were turned over with it in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros generated by the German Football League, this is not much.
However, e-sports are "no longer far removed from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further along.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
Things are also happening in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, first-division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"Compared to other European countries, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Today, it is no longer enough to just fall into nostalgia and glorify the old days.
It is about preserving the tradition of the club, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," Dutt agrees.
"You can't cling to the idea that only in football everything stays the same as it always was."
Goodbye poison eggs - egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all German states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and withdrawn all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven not to contain Fipronil are to be put on the shelves.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new Mini-Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to play as captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern believes the Confederations Cup winner will have a great season - extra motivation won't hurt.
There was something different about his place in the dressing room, Joshua Kimmich saw that immediately, even if the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put the armband assigned to him on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confederations Cup winner said afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.
But Kimmich could also interpret the coach's signal in this way.
It was not Arturo Vidal, eight years older than Kimmich, who was chosen as captain in the C eleven, which consisted of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come back from holiday, but he.
One prefers to hand out sweets to those whom one has a lot of confidence in, whom one wants to keep happy.
So anyone who has been chosen to take over Lahm's legacy can only do with a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old dashed across the field as a mini-Lahm.
Right back, that is now his position, the white armband on his arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich looked like the one who can best take the helm in this starting formation.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unprepared squad.
He had an eye for the big picture, while many others were preoccupied with themselves.
Vidal was trying to cover up his lack of fitness (it hardly worked); Renato Sanches was trying to build on the performance of the Asia trip come hell or high water (it only worked to a certain extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle were trying not to attract negative attention in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
At least that worked out quite well.
Süle played next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, and both performed well.
The Napoli forwards often struggled, and Süle also tried to set up the play successfully a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".
But he also showed a decent performance on his debut.
Shifting play, changing the tempo: "That's the style I was brought in for".
How unfamiliar this Bayern world still is for the newcomers could be seen after the match.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but probably six or seven interviews in the catacombs.
Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp statements at the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I've already noticed what's going on here.
At Bayern, you simply have to win every game".
At least he no longer has to teach that to the new players.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer took to Twitter shortly before the game to wish the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is rooting for our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation.
Our ladies could perhaps also do with the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: economy praises Wissing's pace
The relationship between the state and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister of Economic Affairs.
This is evident after more than a year that the new Minister of Economics, Volker Wissing (FDP), has been in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy when asked by T V - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing is taking up the wishes of the business community, all of which Lemke blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: closing the gap in the Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the state's list of priorities.
The ministry hopes to have a planning approval procedure in place this year, and the building law should be in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the priority list of the Federal Transport Plan, also plays a role in the state's plans.
The goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK), as suggested by Wissing, is striving for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own business, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Skilled Crafts sees the new master craftsman bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master craftsman training.
The homework list for the state remains long, however.
Facts have to be created quickly for the planned road construction, but at the same time the state lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, General Manager of the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Of 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state agency for mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK demands that more contracts be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, vice-chairman of the CDU parliamentary group, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the state is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus is also waiting for a concept from the state on how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The state's broadband expansion to date is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only gave the network supply a grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about slow internet connections and disconnections.
In contrast, ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
Lemke left the Green parliamentary group in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left again after four months due to disagreements.
This is the message of the raft on the Isar on Saturday.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To get the Isar visitors to join in, a raft with a special message will be travelling through Munich tomorrow, Saturday.
If you are drawn to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is no ordinary raft with Isar tourists.
The building department wants to educate the public.
On the raft you will see a large information banner.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is ..." is intended to raise understanding for the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Last summer the raft already travelled the Isar and this year there will be further actions and measures to encourage considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, and the bulbous noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he eked out a living drawing greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Mordillo even found many fans in China.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
By his own account, he still sits at the drawing table in the early morning and works almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his droll figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
For the past six years, he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a centipede as an antagonist.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to hit the big screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script will not be written by him.
That's why he's betting more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, will be produced wordlessly.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Tradesmen, guilds, merchants, vagabonds and a camp of lansquenets are to be seen in the town centre on these days.
In a thunderstorm: pile-up on the A8: many injured
Violent accident on the A8 on Thursday evening: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a pile-up.
There are numerous injuries, kilometre-long traffic jams - and gawkers.
About 20 people were injured in a pile-up on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial police reports, nearly 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, were involved in a pile-up between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm at around 5 pm.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
A police spokesman said that the injuries were light to moderate.
A large number of emergency vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
A tailback of about ten kilometres formed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ reporter reported, there were also massive obstructions on the oncoming lane - due to numerous rubberneckers.
The fire brigade took down the number plates of the drivers, who now have to expect severe penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: You are sitting in the train, unsuspecting, and asleep.
Or you are absorbed in your work and have just had a brilliant thought.
And then: poof.
The conductor comes and wakes you up rudely or pulls you out of the workflow.
Ticket check.
But the days of interruptions will soon be over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing conductorless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and validate your ticket with it.
Test operations are currently underway on two routes.
"If the service is successful, we will expand it.
It will then probably be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a Bahn spokesperson.
"Komfort Check-in" is what the railway calls the ticket validation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use it, however, a few requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also need to have bought it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic validation then appears for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y. If the train attendant checks in at the ticket office, the ticket is validated electronically.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y during the ticket check, he knows that a passenger with an already validated online ticket is sitting there.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to be silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"Those who want to travel in a relaxed manner without ticket checks by our train attendants simply check in themselves in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our staff have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Anyone who travels by train often knows that apart from delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Often you, or in any case one of your fellow passengers, do not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or some other document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the conductor and the passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or large room and delays in checking one's own ticket, and in the end takes away the conductor's time to attend to other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service yet.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss Bit-Galerie
The Bit-Galerie moves people, even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves anyone cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), the other side says: "Nobody needs it" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Megalomania! (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters believe that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, which will also benefit the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bled dry.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the very site of the farmers' market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - facing Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying almost weekly from the farmers' market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes made by the countrywomen are always very popular.
We have also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
Other cities have this too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But the rent for the new project is probably not exactly low."
Eva Kilic: "What is the point of shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our town.
You can see how many shops stand empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly from the producers, and cheap to boot.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It's a pity, speciality shops are almost non-existent and what's left of them will probably disappear then."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't go together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in Bitburg.
Above all, where will the farmers' market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the Bit-Galerie actually comes at some point.
Or will the spectre of the Bit-Galerie manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg before then?"
George Marquet: "That simply won't work.
And nobody needs a shopping centre that stands empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the many - in my opinion - pointless building projects in Bitburg, there is no more room for a farmers' market.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear."
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was announced by the business groups.
It was purely a precautionary measure and no health risks could be assumed, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs that have been tested negative for anti-lice agents containing fipronil may be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi thus wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
Campaign launched: More than 300-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf wrapped up
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand on Friday (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there is to be a festival on Grafenwerth Island as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?" the makers of the campaign have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we are using this action to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we, as citizens of Bad Honnef, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is about formulating a stand-alone promise, one that gives the town an unmistakable unique selling proposition."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is spending a medium five-figure sum on its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara discusses retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week was no exception.
At first glance, a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as in the past, but in the Prime Minister's official residence.
The five deputy prime ministers as well as the ministers of defence, interior, justice and foreign affairs now also took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the head of government.
This meant that the civilians were in the majority at the YAS.
The government is tightening the reins on the military.
Chief of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly for alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are alleged to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been on trial in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already described the attempted coup as a "godsend", as it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease at Military Headquarters".
The newspaper wrote that there were concerns in the general staff about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers.
In any case, the major clean-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree firing another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country.
Three times they putsched, citing their role as guardians of the secular order of the state.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by invoking the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for an Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the coup attempt for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the Alliance about the operational readiness of the Turkish army after the purges.
NATO diplomats say that the command structures and operational capabilities have been "weakened".
Ministry wants to renovate Rennsteig shuttle route
In recent months, the future of the Rennsteig shuttle has been the subject of repeated debate - but now things are to move very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is to begin on the dilapidated route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the long-term future of the Rennsteigshuttle, construction work on the line is to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig line, the state is committing itself to this connection, which is important above all for tourism," explained Secretary of State for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He put the cost of repairing the line at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the state would cover 75 per cent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig Shuttle should be regularly ordered in December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a rail connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig that is particularly popular with tourists.
In the past months, a pilot operation tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to order it regularly again in the future.
Parts of the line are also in serious disrepair.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and to secondary schools.
Three of the pupils will go to the Gymnasium and four to the Realschule.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and members of the public to the Biesental community centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol for the school dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle that grows up in a chicken yard but is then released into the wild.
The lively group performed a musical entitled "The eagle in the chicken yard".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had his chickens hatch it.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning it into a chicken was dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four performed a chicken dance rehearsed by Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young roosters, who wore top hats.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but it belongs.
But it will never be like a chicken.
Its destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in their new school.
She then thanked her colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who always fills in during teaching bottlenecks, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to dismiss her pupils after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she had been able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the pupils sang a song about summertime and the holiday season.
The children were very happy about this.
Eight first graders are already registered for the new school year.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are supposed to improve the emission behaviour of cars in emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before only apply to those vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be carried out as part of the inspection.
How long is the retrofitting likely to take?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily when it comes to the environment."
How long should the update take?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What should drivers who do not drive a BMW, Daimler, Opel or VW car do?
The ACE advises them to wait and see.
Smetanin said that foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit.
Is there now a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears so.
But only in the regions where there is a threat of driving bans.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels so far.
The ACE advises waiting before selling.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the award winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honourees also include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
Lear, who became famous for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not attend the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of funding - and that weighs on me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her views clear.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Past honorees include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's town architect, is retiring next year.
The position has already been advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been the town architect for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work very much, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on the varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
This should allow enough time for familiarisation, taking into account the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
Because the town wants to keep this function in any case.
If it were no longer able to fulfil this function, citizens would have to travel all the way to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports a good working atmosphere as well as a good mood between the authority and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city liveable," he is certain about the building authority and its staff.
But in the future, too, there are varied projects on the agenda: the redevelopment of the former Hukla site and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still on the agenda.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
In terms of design, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre for a city builder.
With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, it is possible to react quite flexibly to many things.
"You can make a lot of things happen," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is a listed ensemble, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the outgoing town architect.
In any case, the city architect bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is the building owner, "at the end of the day, everything runs across my desk here".
For supervision and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (structural engineering) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further development of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, anyone who would like to succeed Roland Wacker should have a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and good knowledge of building regulations and planning law.
The municipal construction office is responsible for structural and civil engineering, urban land use planning, land acquisition, administration of municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and municipal gardening as well as the lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown onto power lines: Southern railway line closed
According to the police, the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the power lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching goods train had to be stopped.
Investigators assume that there were two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses near the scene of the crime.
"This goes far beyond a rascal prank," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators had put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the equipment as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for rail replacement services, the perpetrators could also face penalties from rail customers.
All in all, the spokesman said, a "considerable" sum could be expected.
The damage had been repaired by Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway line was able to continue without obstruction.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which were long-distance trains.
Goods trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots took off from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and stretched across the US in the shape of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
The radar screens showed the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social democratic state premiers always looked to Berlin with a certain anxiety before elections.
The most important wish of the election campaigners was that there should be no disturbing fire from party headquarters and no headwind from the federal government.
Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff at Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even begin to describe a headwind.
They were low blows.
One after the other.
The federal CDU sees the surprising end of the Red-Green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: red-green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green member of parliament has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
Michael Kellner, the Green Party's national director, has called on the defecting Lower Saxony Green Party MP Elke Twesten to give up her mandate.
The defection to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate," the Green Party's federal executive and campaign manager told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"This can't all be true," sighs an SPD election campaigner when the new bad news reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is left without his own government majority after the Green MP Elke Twesten defected to the CDU.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what will happen next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades reassured themselves at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything would be different.
That's exactly what happened - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel sent the SPD reeling, and the Dusseldorf failure knocked the party right off its feet.
The comrades struggled to get back on their feet in the weeks that followed.
Then, just when they had gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with it came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong that could be done wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now Stephan Weil too.
Because of the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the Minister President of Lower Saxony had already been criticised for some time.
This was compounded by poor poll ratings.
Despite this, or perhaps precisely because of it, Weil has been trying more and more in recent weeks to make his mark on the federal government.
The former mayor of Hanover's efforts to expand his power in Berlin did not go unnoticed by comrades close to Martin Schulz.
They let him go because they expected Weil to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In fact, Weil is not to blame for the internal discord within the Green Party in Lower Saxony.
And Schulz certainly isn't.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, tells RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten was not elected to parliament as a direct candidate because of herself, but via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, he continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to give back her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplores an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who is leading Lower Saxony's SPD into the federal election as the top candidate, told RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP is distorting the election results," Oppermann continued.
He demanded that the background be clarified.
I want to know if there was more to it than that, or if there were more far-reaching promises by the Lower Saxony CDU.
Subsidies for village centre III
Anyone who wants to renovate an aging house can soon get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this in Empfingen on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
There have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous redevelopments are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote inner development and not just to develop new building areas.
On 4 April, Schindler received information from the Karlsruhe Regional Council that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounts to 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the state and the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area come into being?
According to Schindler, we will examine where the "really old" houses are.
It also plays a role whether there is any interest in redevelopment in the planned area.
If necessary, the boundaries of the area could be changed again.
Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel represented STEG on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state programme "Socially Integrative City", within the framework of which the redevelopments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a property-by-property basis.
The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the approval period for the subsidies has been running until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in the course of which those involved in the redevelopment area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, if possible, the resolution on the statutes should be passed so that the redevelopment work can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality has to carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies.
It is a matter of assessing the urban deplorable conditions and deciding when and to what extent redevelopment should take place.
A redevelopment note would then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann promised to come back to Empfingen herself to get an idea of the situation.
Gotzel stressed that an essential factor for the success of the project is the participation of those involved.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property questionnaire", which, among other things, deals with the structural condition and redevelopment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Questionnaire", information can be provided on the size, layout and occupants of a living space.
The blue "business sheet" is only to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.
Schindler also emphasised that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "first come, first served" principle.
It was not possible to "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the renovation "palatable" to those present.
TC BW Neuss faces tricky task
The leaders of the second national tennis league will play Suchsdorfer SV, third in the table.
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will play the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV in Kiel tomorrow at 11 am.
Despite still having a flawless record after five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team manager Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent.
"They are a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
The Suchsdorfer SV's class and stability are provided above all by the imports from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns have even played in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going to be tough for us, as always.
You need a good portion of luck there, too."
The Neuss squad for the trip to the far north is practically set.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for the Blue-White.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still playing in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could also make the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill up the squad.
How America can hurt OMV
Donald Trump did not look really happy when he signed his signature on the bill to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In its haste to pass the bill", Congress had packed in a few "unconstitutional provisions", he causticly remarked.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels fumed against the US move.
After all, the draft provides for penalising European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Investors in the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been correspondingly worried since then.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company's official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"Die Presse" took a look at which ones the corporation could fend off and which ones could really hurt him.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city is organising the day-care centre lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is being turned back in the municipal day-care centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will once again take over the provision of meals in the municipal day-care centres (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking will continue to be done off-site: a caterer will take over this task and deliver freshly cooked, refrigerated food.
The city runs 46 day-care centres in the Krefeld area, and in 44 of them the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the last year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are looked after for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the day care centre," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care, when children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time employees will be on kitchen duty from 1 September: they will heat the delivered food, add salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, serve the food, clear away, wash up and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a day-care centre," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the day-care team," says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"They are much more involved and it is easier for the day-care centre management to implement educational concepts.
Because that's also what it's about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense.
For the children, too.
"They have a known person in the day care centre, a person they are familiar with, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care centre rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - has the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen services, but also that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in a cost comparison between in-house management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
And that is despite the fact that 46 part-time staff will be newly employed.
"But with around 750 people in the education sector, these hours are not that significant," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Hike to the TV Anniversary
On the occasion of its 110th anniversary, the TV Kaiseringen invites you to a short hike followed by coffee and cake.
The hike starts on Sunday, 9 July, at 1 pm in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in Amerikastraße.
From there it goes to the airfield, to the Natter and via the Waldhof back to the water reservoir.
The hike takes about one and a half hours.
Afterwards, there will be coffee, cake, cool drinks, string sausages and cheese rolls at the school in Kaiseringen.
If you need a lift from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten, the meeting point is in Kaiseringen at the school.
Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolping Street, at around 2.55 pm because they wanted to make a phone call on the girl's mobile phone.
However, the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but failed.
The duo fled without any loot.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30, causing property damage of over 200 euros to the vehicle's fairing.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, are asking for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and hit the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese at around 7.55 pm.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came towards him in his lane, so that he had to swerve to the right.
The Touran driver hit the crash barrier.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without paying any attention to the accident.
According to the victim, it is possible that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the car that caused the accident to contact the police station in Stolzenau on 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report Exonerates Pope's Brother Georg Ratzinger".
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir continues to cause discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur after publication that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised that "double standards" were applied in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that they were "shameful and disgraceful acts" that had to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of referring to the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "People like to go after the Church and this is a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a quite normal pedagogical means" "to deal with naughty children like me".
She said it was unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world had changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely unjustly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoir "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to come to Georg Ratzinger's defence," says Hesemann, "because none of this had anything to do with him," he assesses the findings of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, the lawyer commissioned by the Regensburg diocese to clarify the matter?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral Priests were victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s "with a high degree of plausibility", 67 Cathedral Priests were sexually abused.
The final report says the following about Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially in cases of high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also turn out to be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir exonerates Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence against Protected Persons at the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir" gives a contradictory picture of Cathedral Choirmaster Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who often became violent when a Domspatz did not produce a top musical performance.
As his biographer, what do you think of this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from cover to cover, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is mentioned at all.
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or connivance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violent excesses at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of having learned about it too late or of not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by practically all those interviewed as - literally - "salvation", "heaven" and a "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his pupils also give Georg Ratzinger a very excellent report card, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by bunches of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to outbursts of rage.
The fact that he not only banged chairs and threw the bunch of keys on the floor, but also slapped boys in the face and pulled their hair or ears when they were too cheeky, is something he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you still know such methods of chastisement?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I too experienced it in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the pre-school, these are admittedly trifles.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his fame and his role as Benedict XVI's brother that many media outlets have pounced on him.
After all, many who never understood the Bavarian Pope are still eagerly working on him.
But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In connection with the report, there was a lot of media coverage on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir.
Does the final report accuse Georg Ratzinger of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral conductor.
Not even the parents were privy.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," one victim testified on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clearing up sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide in their parents and siblings, then certainly not in a choirmaster, who in a way would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen pupils assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One interviewed pupil put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... absurd to assume that he, of all people, would have been able to ... boys have opened up more forcefully or more clearly or more readily to him than to their parents, boarding school directors, guidance counsellors, etc.
That one talks to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that affected pupils and/or their environment confided in him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be absolved of any complicity.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented it or not having reported it.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was much talk in the media about "excesses of violence" at the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir.
The former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "looking the other way".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely the misuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the Domspatzen grammar school, between sexual abuse and violent excesses and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beatings, the cases in which boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly as a result, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
At that school, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject of "pre-school" was taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped it and enjoyed the much better treatment and, for many, even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, for whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate positive memories with him despite the violence".
So the most that remains is the accusation of having looked the other way.
But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which he was told about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and (according to the witness) did not want to hear anything about what was going on at a school where he did not work and was not responsible, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the situation?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to him "that corporal punishment continues to be practised in the pre-school".
Already in view of the danger of negative press publications, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when corporal punishment had long since been banned in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably remembers.
It was difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerating or dramatising and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
But you can't say he always looked the other way either.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But of course that does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to the abominations and violence perpetrated against innocent children's souls in preschool, which goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
It is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
But at the same time I have to defend Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of corporal punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, and the Domspatzen only played a minor role.
Nevertheless, I am by no means concealing the fact that he ran a strict regime there.
But that also has to be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to turn the previously rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen into a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
Biscuits and sweets alone do not make great singers out of stubborn boys, and before every success, no matter in what field, there is always discipline, passion and self-conquest.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger to be during the discussions on your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally kind, deeply religious and kind-hearted person of whom one cannot imagine that he could harm even a fly.
I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who to this day do not forgive him for once being hard on them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect to whom they still look up to today and whom they virtually revere.
And please, once again very clearly: Everything that he is accused of are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome those times.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
There, the evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
For the report that has just been published exonerates him.
Now decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburg Cathedral Boys' Choir, should finally be left in peace.
