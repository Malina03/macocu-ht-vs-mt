DFB head Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That is a question that of course depends on getting into conversation at some point, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one thing or another the way it is set down in his statement," Grindel said in the "Bild-Zeitung" football podcast "Phrasenmäher".
Despite the now months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he said he regretted the 92-time international Özil's resignation.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil for not being ready for a discussion with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He said he had not wanted to build up pressure, but he knew from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Garden shed on fire in allotment settlement
At 2.13 p.m. the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line ran directly over the allotment garden settlement, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be almost completely removed and the fire debris had to be cleared out to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged in a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire - as well as the cause of the fire - still has to be determined.
It is likely to be considerable, however, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden shed.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has live-streamed herself apparently trying to snatch the children of a family in Moscow.
This was reported by the US portal "TMZ", which published a partial recording of the stream.
Watch "Kissed for Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan here.
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and walking up to a possibly homeless family she claims to have identified as refugees from Syria.
As the family virtually flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
She provides no evidence for any of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to chase the family down the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks like she turns around and slaps Lohan across the face.
In tears, the actress then professes how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This is the task of "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is to approach the asteroid Ryugu so closely that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the death toll is said to be at least 420.
The number of victims could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet reached the devastated areas, which have been cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla board chairman
In the beginning, there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused turmoil on the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have settled.
Tesla and Musk have to pay up and the Tesla boss retires from the board of directors, but he may remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Conference
Tightly guarded - the Tory party conference.
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about this doubling of names for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future, and the people will vote on it this Sunday - will it go well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His fiercest rival is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" clean-up taking longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still there," Peter Mertens, board member for development, told the industry journal Automobilwoche.
The imprisoned and suspended Audi boss Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the taskforce would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations will probably have been examined," he had said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force had been set up in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false emissions values after the emissions cheats came to light.
In doing so, he had known about the manipulations or had deliberately ignored them.
At present, Bram Schot, the company's sales director, is acting as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new WLTP emissions and consumption test standard, there are production losses at Audi, Schot told the newspaper "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans like the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is focusing on electric mobility.
He said there were already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year despite criticism of him after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest on ZDF's "Aktueller Sportstudio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, that's what I'm going to do.
And then we have to see whether the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if, after winning the bid for the 2024 European Football Championship, he did not "feel like working on the project for the future".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairytale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB's national conference on 27 September 2019.
Future European Championship chief organiser Philipp Lahm is expected to join the DFB presidium, according to Grindel.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues on the presidium agree that he should continue to advise the presidium in this role in the future and then, of course, he is cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair involving the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become the DFB's integration ambassador.
Currently, the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter of whom has family roots in Cameroon, hold this office.
"If someone without a migration background were to have a clear impact on society and football and say "this is an important topic, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Lose weight properly with half-smart scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks now.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but that's a bit of a waste of time.
It says nothing about whether I have replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening victories for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
The runners-up easily won 112-55 (52-31) against Science City Jena and played a convincing game for 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berlin team with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his competitive debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won 84-80 (39-37) at s.Oliver Würzburg on the debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer for the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year's play-off semi-finalists MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83-76 (41-34).
New international Karim Jallow was the top scorer for coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
They won a clear 100:64 (48:30) at the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig and got their first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings excelled for Oldenburg with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run by the Baskets quickly made things clear.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
Cologne's city centre was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic association Ditib is criticised because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and a scare
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B promoted more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved in whatever way you can," Mendes told a crowd of 60,000 at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringe and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations also appeared on stage during the spectacle, which lasted several hours.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock when many spectators mistook the sound of a metal barrier falling over for gunshots, got scared and tried to flee.
Panic ensued briefly and people ran around.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people down from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the internet, as they are every year.
Those who wanted to get hold of one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the internet.
The audience cheered and applauded the numerous musicians and actors, but booed Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, Flake spoke on stage for more equal rights for men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in favour of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge in the US Senate Judiciary Committee, thus upsetting many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who said they had experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in a lift on the way to the committee meeting.
"You are also welcome to join me in a lift anytime," Flake now told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: German government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
The problem was the disruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a lot of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
That applies completely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or of supporting or being members of banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership holds the movement responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
This is how fresh and handsome his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by NDR, is known for humid conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller toasts many a beer, wine or even high-proof drink with her guests to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink up their courage for the obligatory singing interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time he was joined by actor Florian David Fitz, known from films such as "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
However, the trip to the far north did not go down well with the Munich native.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he just has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And leave out the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past two, too.
The 43-year-old's alcohol consumption is truly written all over his face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the afterpains.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches or - probably the most effective - headache pills.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly binge.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to deal with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Rotkäppchenland region of Treysa is hard to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly in sight.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and litter, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating area to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has presented itself for some time.
For the showpiece railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland, this is a more than inglorious sight.
The issue has been on the minds of members of the Schwalmstadt ADFC local group and others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the town's cycling officer.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling advisory council.
So far there has been no solution.
Suggestions ranged from relocating the seating area to regularly emptying the litter bins and cleaning the surfaces at the boarding point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local advisory council.
It is not only the rubbish that worries cyclists and residents - the seating area is a regular meeting place for partying at weekends.
Not only is there often a lot of noise, but there is also destruction during the parties: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are knocked down, and seating furniture is graffitied.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert says that volunteers have often cleaned up the area.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area along the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for binge drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill here," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also worried about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which opens today.
"If it suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that would raise the threshold for encroaching on common property.
However, that would require a police patrol to come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße hill developed.
It must be made more attractive.
The number of people using the cycle path so far is very satisfactory.
There is still room for improvement in tourism marketing.
Our cycle path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany," say the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger spot.
There is no turning lane onto the Haaße hill.
When the traffic is busy, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the flow of traffic on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty cyclists, but it is for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for a music contest was a success, creatively and in cooperation.
"T o perform a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the friendly Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who has lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the Nine from the "Hiltrup Star Colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, explained district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other districts.
What did the lyricists see themselves connected with?
Among the places, the Hiltrup Lake and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly often.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue the "Kö of Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or information about their work.
Humberg, for example, told us that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke told us about sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, who recently performed in Ludwigshafen at a big BASF event with Barclay James Harvest on the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all kinds of stuff on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup's gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed once more for the finale - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG grammar school and Oliver Ahlers from the business association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The Stadtteiloffensive had initiated the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
The event was a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in a game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
Each side has a screen with four cards containing key words that can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - once they have been inserted.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
The cards then read, for example, from left to right: "1. renaissance.
2. window.
3. dice.
4. festival".
These are the terms that have to be encoded from now on.
The aim is not to guess the terms, but the codes.
One player per team takes turns being the encoder.
He or she gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fixed" and "window" - and to do so in such a way that his own team recognises the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because the opposing team wins the game if it succeeds in breaking the code twice.
So the scrambler writes down and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "lots" as the opposite of party; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the defenestration there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can guess them better with every clue that the scrambler there gives.
The paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too wacky, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The other players will probably have to study it for a long time and in detail before they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much emotion is contained in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as its predecessor and genre leader "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you are only interested in guessing and not in victory points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler salute to police and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man kept the Kulmbach police department busy twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First, he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, and later he attracted attention in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated and did not comply with the police's expulsion order, he had to spend the night in a detention cell at the Kulmbach police station.
When sober, he will also have to answer to the police for using signs of unconstitutional organisations.
Pressig depot was the home of the locomotives
The railway depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history came to an end.
"When buffers banged against buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the village and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes also squealed and the wagons rattled.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's home town of Pressig.
Nowhere else in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
This was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude, has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
To manage this, train and pusher locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway depot with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, catenary and railway master's workshop.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," recounts Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
From the Pressig railway depot (BW), which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight ellocomotives were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and pusher locomotives.
From 1977, they were only needed for goods trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 wagons were still shunted per month.
In 1982, parts of the depot were demolished, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site, also in terms of freight traffic, was not envisaged".
At Whitsun 1989, the Nuremberg railway directorate celebrated the 50th anniversary of the electrification of the Nuremberg-Saalfeld railway line with a grandiose station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A short time later, the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn and Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The marshallers and inhibiters did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two towns and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world number three is either Julia Putintseva from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.
Siegemund was leading 6-3, 4-2 against Darja Kassatkina when the 13th-seeded Russian retired.
The Swabian will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Pleasure" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
The organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather with great relief when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" opened in the open-air grounds of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 works by 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been involved since the very beginning.
So has Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organiser and artist in equal measure.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his retirement a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and helped to design flyers.
This year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will again be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg provided the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realises that the title "Wind Chime Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance to the estate, the "Glücksbaum" (Tree of Happiness) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right-hand side.
It is a tree stump, lightened in colour, playfully equipped with 20 pinwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as sound pieces.
With the sun glinting through the bushes in the background, the object has a fairytale-like, pensive effect and invites the viewer to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and dedicates herself to the event of 15 years of K&G, preferably in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in motion in the wind.
Halfway along the route, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind Chimes Performance" invites visitors to stroll through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the people of Albachten also gave vent to their discontent at that time.
At least five of them did.
They refused to accept that there would be no more singing in the district after the dissolution of the "Cäcilia" church choir.
It has become a legend: They founded the MGV 68 Albachten on a bench in Tinnenbusch.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in a big way in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It's going to be full today," suspected chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was to be proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the foundation party especially for the anniversary.
It had been a tradition for years, but then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It was an elegant ball, and guests had been asked to wear festive clothes.
The guests were not seated in rows as usual in the "Haus der Begegnung", but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln turned up the volume and invited the guests onto the dance floor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten let their voices be heard.
In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were the order of the day.
Almost set: "Such a day, so beautiful like today".
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was "Rüdesheim wine".
In an allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hop".
Again sovereign was the choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterstroke that he does." By the way, it was not only men who presented themselves singing this time.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the Allwetter Zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - the USC Münster reserve team, under the patronage of Axel Büring, is really finding its feet in League Three.
No trace of timidity or fear, the independents do their thing.
And they did it really well in a 3-0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) win against city rivals BW Aasee.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. On the contrary.
In the evening, at a belated birthday party for Ronja de Boer, the mood was good and the game was over.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set point.
"If they get it into the goal, a match like that can turn over," Büring knows from years of experience.
In the end, USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full score home.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I saw some really good volleyball at times," said Annacker, not complaining about the 0:3 - and immediately went back to business as usual.
Where the journey will take the independents seems impossible to predict after just three match days.
"It is simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
He only feels confirmed in one thing: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
It's not even remotely comparable to regional league volleyball." They don't want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
If they don't soil their waistcoat in the next few weeks, they will have to look upwards.
But a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday, the team goes to Emlichheim.
Aasee will play in Essen on 14 October.

The best reactions on the net.
Of course, the social media also discussed Djuricin's departure.

Of course, the fans are already thinking about a successor.
While Didi Kühbauer is considered the favourite, some fans are showing a sense of humour.
Trend sports cause record attendance in Braunschweig at the weekend
The city centre was fuller than ever on Saturday.
On Sunday only a few parking spaces left in the city's multi-storey car parks.
The city's marketing department reports a record number of visitors.
The Trendsport weekend was a great advertisement for the shopping city of Braunschweig.
A highly attractive supporting programme played a major part in this.
Up to now, Trendsport Weekend has meant that BMXers and skateboarders get their money's worth.
Four injured after accident at crossroads in Hildburghausen
Four people were injured in an accident.
According to information so far, one car driver had disregarded the right of way of the other in Coburger Straße shortly before noon on Sunday.
The cars collided.
The four injured people were taken to hospital by ambulance.
There were traffic obstructions.
The cars had to be towed away.
The Hildburg fire brigade cleared the scene of the accident.
Glider crashes - student pilot killed in accident
The pilot of a glider crashed in Essen.
The single-seat glider crashed on Sunday afternoon while landing in a car park not far from Essen-Mülheim airport, a police spokesman said in Essen on Sunday.
The car park next to the 52 motorway, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, and no other people were injured in the crash.
Emergency chaplains continued to attend to student pilots and eyewitnesses at the scene.
The venue of an Oktoberfest was in the immediate vicinity, and numerous guests were expected there in the evening.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was fine, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, much used by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Traumschiff".
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been partly to blame for her marriage break-up with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on 01 January 2018 she left the ship for good.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me at eye level," Keller tells Bild am Sonntag.
At first she was always just "Hans von Borsody's wife", but that changed with "Traumschiff".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked that so much, I don't know".
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time could have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans also shied away from talking about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried to be "the only one right for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In other words, I pretended," she explains.
She always had the feeling that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, which in truth I never was, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller nevertheless said yes once more, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller imagined love "like in a film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I approached love far too naively".
The moth, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ Zurich section, this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but still a little shy of light.
And the glaring glare of a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz blinds him unduly.
But it's a film festival, and more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he staggers across the square on this late Thursday evening to relieve himself briefly in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company that is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The toilet facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion takes great pains to exude a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, it stinks to high heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just been entertained to the best level by the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department stores', as they do every year.
Its name fits this film festival perfectly: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the globe.
What do you have to come up with in an article about this festival to avoid surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The butterfly ties a ribbon around its antennae that a fairy godmother has slipped it, and two brawny bouncers do indeed generously wave it in.
Inside, the guests crowd around, dancing to live music well after midnight or listening to the DJ's rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and wash down exquisite appetisers with cüpli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters await slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
It's been like this for years, so it seems to work without much loss.
You have to love this country for that!
The folder studies the sign by the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has got the dress code wrong.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares section upstairs, the winged man downs a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", in keeping with the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily win the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between the local celebrities, the cash desk and the kitchenware, a face passes by that looks familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading man should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, who at almost sixty looks almost like a choirboy, is about to walk through the crowd.
He is not chatted up, not gawked at, at most one squints furtively.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as uptightness, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is happy about his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the dressing room, as can be seen in a video released earlier on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division side had beaten Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute defeat
Swen Bieletzki, coach of handball league team ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His charges were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) defeat - the fourth in the fourth match - at LIT Germania 2 on Saturday evening.
After all, they had not played badly over long periods - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst.
It was only the opening phase that "we totally overslept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The home side quickly took an 8:1 lead, and even the early time-out that Bieletzki took did not work at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki said, summing up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the deficit was only two goals.
Especially Sendens' best player, Marius Hintze, scored several times during this phase.
After the change, things got even better from the visitors' point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised at 15:15, after which the relay team led almost throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three goals (29:26).
And then?
The referees intervened.
Bieletzki is usually careful not to blame others.
But the 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well at the back even against seven men and repeatedly threw at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we need a damn win," said Bieletzki, who was completely satisfied.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old woman from Naila (district of Hof), police are searching for her remains.
On Saturday, the police dug up a road near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor's office jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman might have been buried not far from her former place of residence.
The woman has been missing since 4 November 1986.
Investigators did not rule out foul play at the time.
Since last year, the Hof Criminal Investigation Department has again been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor's office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Office for the Protection of Monuments, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road near Marxgrün by means of ground penetrating radar.
With the help of a dog trained to smell human bones, the officials narrowed the site down to a few metres.
The results of the dig should be announced later this afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does no harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages that could have seen Musk lose his licence to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay 20 million dollars, and Musk will also relinquish the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the head of the German supervisory board.
He may, however, remain chairman of the board.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager for fraud before the US Federal Court in Manhattan.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk let it be known that he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On 7 August, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might delist the company, paying $420 per share, with financing secured.
This would have valued Tesla at a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla would remain on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, hire two independent board members and set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea FC
Liverpool FC still managed a 1-1 draw at Chelsea FC.
In the top match at Chelsea FC, the attacker, who had just been substituted by coach Jürgen Klopp, made the score 1-1 (0:1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins to start with, Liverpool dropped to second place.
Chelsea remain third, with Manchester City the new leaders.
Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, Klopp's team missed the equaliser several times.
International Antonio Rüdiger cleared on the line after a solo run by Liverpool's top scorer Mohamed Salah (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a shot into the corner.
Record champions Manchester United are sliding deeper into crisis after their worst start to a season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho deservedly lost 3-1 (0-2) at West Ham United and remains in mid-table with ten points after seven matchdays.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia FC.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance following an injury to Petr Cech.
Ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion with goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané set up the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan did not feature for the new leaders.
"Let's Dance" judge Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalinhalt), citing Llambi's lawyer, reports on the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser informed according to "BamS".
The most important thing for the couple now is the well-being of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful ballroom dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his role as a judge on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances on quiz and entertainment programmes.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
Barcelona - There were clashes with the police during demonstrations in Barcelona on Saturday.
Supporters of the separatists threw paint powder at riot police who were keeping them away from a counter-demonstration.
According to local media reports, 14 people were slightly injured.
A total of six people were arrested.
Polls: 46 per cent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, the GroKo has suffered several low blows in the polls.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD nationwide for the first time in Emnid's Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll by the opinion research institute, the AfD gains one point to 17 per cent, while the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week, landing at 16 per cent.
The CDU and CSU also lose one point and now only have 27 per cent.
This is the lowest figure ever for the CDU/CSU in the Sunday trend.
The Greens score 15 per cent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 per cent.
If federal elections were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU together would only get 43 per cent of the vote, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost its majority in the Sunday polls of all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 per cent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 federal election, they still received a combined 53.4 per cent.
Among the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 per cent.
The Greens achieve vote shares of 12.5 to 17 per cent.
The Left Party averages 10 per cent, the FDP 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 per cent of citizens think Merkel is the right person to hold the chancellorship, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 per cent) currently want the grand coalition to last until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed a significant drop in Merkel's popularity.
Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 per cent are in favour, 44 per cent against.
Among CDU/CSU supporters, 64 per cent want her to run for office, 35 per cent do not.
Posting at Aldi: Price-reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi becoming Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic stories about getting to know someone - should have a chat about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket almost radiates anachronistic romance as a place to get to know the great love.
Yes, that's right, a conversation about reduced turkey, boxer shorts bargains at the rummage table or the favourite pudding is still, in case of doubt, a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less of a contact exchange and more of a raunchy one.
We dared to test it: How do women react when you don't beat around the bush in the very first message?
Here are the astonishing results.
It has real Hollywood love story potential if the love happiness is preceded by a lost-and-found plot.
When the guy then contacts his beloved at bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and their ilk - romantic comedy at its best.
So it is to be hoped that the creator of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us will find the man of her dreams, with whom she had a brief conversation about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
She certainly deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analogue getting to know someone.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Lids against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, known as polio in German, causes symptoms ranging from paralysis to death.
Polio is considered to have been eradicated in Germany, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for rest for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
It's not good for the boy.
And it's not good for us," Reus, who is friends with Götze, told TV channel Sky after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already emphasised before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of Bundesliga football club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do that.
"But there will definitely be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told TV channel Sky on Sunday evening.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher's performance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch was hard on his team.
The coach of the district league team VfL Wolbeck was at a loss for words and withdrew (inwardly) to ponder the lack of motivation on the pitch.
All history.
In the meantime, things are running smoothly again at the Brandhoveweg.
The dewy-eyed proof is Sunday's 1-1 draw against SC Altenrheine, who only narrowly missed out on promotion last season.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of," said Fetsch, praising his boys and seeking out every single one of them after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious visitors.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came on in his place - the team changed almost seamlessly from a 4-4-2 to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck clearly had more of the game in the first period.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This was almost avenged when the SCA struck twice in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes failed narrowly from 18 metres.
Schroer was also late on a Thewes cross after 58 minutes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch gave the left side a new lease of life.
In the 70th minute, when Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues, the home side were awarded an indirect free kick 18 metres from the visitors' goal.
The player who had been fouled took the kick himself and demonstrated his danger with standards.
Westhue's right-footed shot went in at the bottom left - 1:0 (71).
20 minutes to go, which were to be damn long.
And then this: In the 80th minute, VfL captain Florian Quabeck was unfortunate enough to catch the ball on his hand in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske scored the winner from twelve metres in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt win 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five matchdays - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting eleven for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic bone injury and should use his heading power to prevent the SGE from conceding any more goals from standards.
Reading material before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt want to scramble further up the table, which building sites Eintracht Frankfurt need to close quite soon - and how Allan Souza somehow still wants to assert himself at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, an accident occurred at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama occurred at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
During the landing of a helicopter there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a standstill on its side.
The police, ambulance and fire brigade were called immediately.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
To be on the safe side, the ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called.
Passengers only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There was only property damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigations.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small incipient fire, but it was quickly extinguished.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity on corporate boards of directors
This means that only 8 per cent of board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was made available to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in advance.
"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, the foundation's executive director.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with few exceptions - have long been unthinkable.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies is solely due to positive impulses among the companies of the mid-sized index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 per cent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8 per cent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in the past years - the share of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently again in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would continue to make no voluntary commitment to increase the proportion from the previous "zero per cent".
The picture is different for the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited annually for the boards, a share of 40 per cent would already be reached in 2023," the report says.
Some are even making a killing: Luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari earns the most.
The Italians take in 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble suppliers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This is the question that "car pope" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has dealt with.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even add a lot to each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are doing well with prices averaging 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in EBIT before interest and taxes.
(sda) On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she was becoming a mother for the first time.
The long-time No. 1 finally ended her career at the end of last year with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in singles.
In July, she married Harald Leemann from Zug.
She did not reveal the date of her birth.
Torchlight procession at the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival season with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organises the wine festivals, which from now on take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
To kick off the anniversary, those responsible marched through the village to the festival site to the sounds of the Wiesenbronn marching band.
In the already packed marquee, the chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests. "To organise something like this for 60 years - that is an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
That's something to be proud of," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later toasted symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind again". Later, "Die Troglauer" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, when the Abtswind Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set drink prices in the afternoon as they were 60 years ago to mark the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the Haus des Gastes, before the second round will be held one day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency doctor's car crashes into taxi
An emergency ambulance is badly damaged on the side of a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured when the emergency vehicle collided with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called out, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such an emergency drive in Bonn ended fatally for a 26-year-old woman.
Bonn - A 26-year-old female pedestrian was fatally injured when an emergency ambulance collided with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, according to police.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency doctor's car had run a red light with flashing blue lights and siren on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided with the taxi, which was running on green, at an intersection.
After the collision, the doctor's car skidded against a traffic light post and a tree.
In the process, it hit the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old female taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be rescued by emergency services.
The 29-year-old female emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she was unable to help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor who had been called tried to do so - but without success.
The three seriously injured people were taken to hospitals.
The police are investigating who is to blame for the accident in close cooperation with the public prosecutor's office in Bonn.
Manchester United lose again, things get uncomfortable for Mourinho
After the disgraceful exit in the League Cup, Manchester United now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU lost 1:3 against West Ham United and the manner of the defeat is likely to be the subject of much discussion.
Emblematic was the scene in the 74th minute when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting Mark Nobel's pass was offside, all the Manchester defenders stood still, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to fire the ball past a helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been inadequate for long stretches.
United's city rivals Manchester City are in a completely different mood at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, came to an unchallenged 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Raheem Sterling broke through the home team's defensive bar for the first time after half an hour.
Sergio Agüero's one-two with the former scorer after just over an hour ensured a sixth win in seven games and a move to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer top of table
Three days after the 2-1 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri earned a 1-1 draw with Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As in the Cup exit, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's 25th-minute goal remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed an equaliser on 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better with his 89th-minute flick.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and now the Blues also toppled Liverpool from the top of the table with the draw in the league.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, Gunners fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success story against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes from time, Watford defender Craig Cathcart booted Alex Iwobi's cross into his own net, and Mesut Özil's third goal of the season just two minutes later gave Arsenal the lead.
Arsenal's fifth win in a row moved them past Watford into fifth place, just behind rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton, under Portuguese coach Espirito Santo, continue to make a strong impression.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row with a 2-0 win over Southampton and are in 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show marked by diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting are not likely to let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their new products in the French capital from next week onwards, together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
One big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first purely electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
However, both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled for launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorbike manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers will also be present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi as a result of the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second 7.4.
Communication and transport links were damaged, and there was enormous damage to property.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
So far, the figures only come from Palu.
But numerous other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorbike pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne, together with a team of helpers, celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral needs of the high-horsepower two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of every month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the motorcycles were lined up in front of the church entrance.
The first thing on the agenda was the bikers' morning pint, with coffee and cake or a hearty curry sausage to fortify oneself.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorbike group from Gummersbach, were also present.
Pastor Dirk Grzegorek preached the sermon during the biker service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical accompaniment.
"Although bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-quiet tones," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorbike service yesterday.
Füchtorf local history society celebrates big festival: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Now and then Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Probably not many of the children could yet imagine how this would one day become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to watch this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the pieces of apple, which looked a little like chopped fruit, layer by layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had ready-bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest Federweißen to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got to talk, while the children could not only watch the apple pressing process, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up for them.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers also got involved in the festival and invited people to play entertaining games at some of the stations.
Next year, the local history society will also offer a day of action.
However, as Gregor Krützkamp pointed out, it will not be held at the Heimathaus in the heart of the Spargeldorf.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: after all, it will be about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth defeat of the season: "Shitty situation".
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and spoke encouragement to them.
However, there was not much positive to see beforehand in the last-placed team's 1:4 (0:2) defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out of it as a team," said 96 professional footballer Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course it's disappointing, because you always have a lot on your mind."
The still winless Lower Saxony side, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) scored the equaliser, are two points adrift at the bottom of the table and in their current condition are candidates for relegation.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winners, who moved into mid-table with seven points after a successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous attacking action of the Hessians and could never be controlled by Hannover's defence.
The striker, who had been injured for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Rebic was joined in the starting line-up for the first time by Allan, a Brazilian on loan from Liverpool FC, and the Frankfurt side started brightly.
A header by Lucas Torró (17th) deflected onto the goal net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who was absent at short notice.
The lead for the home side was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a corner had been blocked, Haller headed the ball in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who had arrived from French second-division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed up before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his strike partner Rebic, who skilfully cut through and gave 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to his team's poor performance and brought on two new attacking players in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a little more courageously forward, but there were no sparkling ideas until shortly before the end, when they at least managed to score the final goal.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest of the game was just a show for Frankfurt against overtaxed visitors, and Jovic also scored a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, the atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre was good.
Munich's Lord Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185th Munich Wies'n in front of an audience of millions.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
The Geisingen Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the 30 Years War and which, according to legend, was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the bullet wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
The church is still not finished, only the chancel is there, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminded the congregation that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance to the parish of Geising.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing, the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has then invited people to the Catholic parish hall for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and, in keeping with the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church. Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed the visitors about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.
Now that the scaffolding has been up for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that was already present a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been discovered, which was only made possible by the visual inspection using scaffolding.
The plastering of the plinth has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter, and it is hoped that a good half of this work can be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home in Neu-Ulm's Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those present at the inauguration agreed that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its intended use in Münsterblickstraße.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former US Army officers' building was put to the test for residents with handicaps: "The building was getting on in years and no longer had up-to-date facilities," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building was to be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential home
Lebenshilfe invested about 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million Euros, the district of Swabia 450000 Euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and finances.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between barrier-free and fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the residents to experience the freedom of being able to move around without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, expressed a similar opinion: "The home is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
In the process, homeliness and functionality have been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it cannot be acquired in this way in today's situation".
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square metres of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time staff, all of whom are employed according to collective bargaining agreements.
Germany: Schwesig deplores differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy federal chairperson of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be content with these differences," the Minister President of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
She said it was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than people in West Germany, but received 15 per cent less pay.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unification," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waters between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two dogs, which are about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
According to the statement, they passed through the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilogrammes of dog food to "help the animals acclimatise".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
At the same time, the two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to bid jointly to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published that answer this question mostly by looking back on the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a completely different approach in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the facts - that is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Grand Coalition that starts today.
There has hardly been an interview or a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also the CSU have not recently invoked the mantra of a "return to work".
This may have led many a craftsman, doctor, cashier and other gainfully employed citizen in this country to legitimately ask what the difference actually is between work and material work, but so be it.
If the federal government is now ready to get back to its job - governing - it should not be held back by debates on terminology.
Whether the CDU/CSU and SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks will possibly be seen on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for a coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this meeting regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson learned from all the quarrels.
First, however, conflict-prone issues are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies off lightly with exchange premiums, while the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as obliged to technically retrofit older diesels.
While there were signs of a rapprochement in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the CDU/CSU and SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD demands that rejected asylum seekers who work or do an apprenticeship be given the chance to stay.
The CDU/CSU is strictly against the "lane change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be arguments among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
It is not like and like that have come together to form the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different views of society and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without conflict, a society characterised by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests cannot move forward.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be turned into a question of to be or not to be for party tactical reasons.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD should argue, but always keep the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel issue and the lane change issue can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain trust.
This is what the mainstream parties have to fight for now.
Pilz examines working hours at Hartinger
Minister targeted
Is the Labour Minister, of all people, violating the current employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
Her legists had worked "day and night" on the social security reform, reported an exuberant Social Affairs Minister at the presentation of the reform a fortnight ago.
Daniela Holzinger, a member of the List-Pilz, is astonished by the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via a question.
She assumes "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the commitment of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of applicable civil service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to "clear Hartinger of any suspicion".
Police tear up a road in search of woman's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging has been going on on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The road is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Prior to this, the investigators had used an archaeology dog.
The dog, which is specially trained to smell old human bones, together with its handler, was finally able to narrow down the relevant spot to a few metres after several deployments.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the section of road in question.
The public prosecutor's office and the Hof criminal police have been working on the missing person case for more than a year.
Time and again, a cycle path near Marxgrün has been closed and examined with sonar equipment because the investigators suspect that Heike's body might have been buried here during the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Paint powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But riots are already taking place beforehand.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues who worked in the polling stations last year during the referendum, which was deemed illegal, with a rally.
At that time, there had also been violence in the attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break through the police cordon by force and threw paint pellets and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under receivership in autumn 2017.
The regional president at the time, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also fled abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, are still in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans' "right to self-determination".
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate goallessly
Rot-Weiß Ahlen continues to tread water.
FC Gütersloh also only managed a 0-0 draw.
The last-place team and the third-last-place team turned out to be a bunch of helplessness in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was very poor in terms of entertainment.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worrying.
There was no danger of missing a goal-scoring opportunity, because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - chance came from the Ahlen side when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a save with a shot from the edge of the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury and Sinan Aygün came on for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed just over the goal from 18 metres, and after an hour, the Gütersloh side also made their first offensive appearance.
After Matthäus Wieckowicz had won the ball, the game was on.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the swift counter-attack via Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also added to their tally with a header by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner kick by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing on Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It had no effect - nothing.
Thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlen team could not achieve more than an optical superiority.
It was not until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but this too was of no avail.
Afterwards, Angelo Daut tried to emphasise the positive aspects: "I like the fact that we played to nil". But unfortunately, the nil also stood in front.
"This time, we weren't as goal-threatening as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponents didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a bit of a ripple" against a team "that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't have the feeling that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
Unfortunately for him, the spectators didn't get the feeling that his team could score a goal either.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfeld Harvest Festival: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for which the donations are intended, are happy about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also stay in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was a brilliant blue, but the square was still a little empty, but that was to change in the course of the day.
Because: "It is so nice and sociable here, that's why we are here today", said a visitor.
The organiser of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in their Kiepenkerl outfits as always with a good dose of humour.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were actually supposed to be weighed out for food.
Verena (Ferdi Kreimer's daughter) fell ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not miss the opportunity to entertain the growing number of visitors musically.
This went down so well that at a late hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Simply great," said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to fit the opening date into his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stalls, among them mainly associations.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked the men's choir for its action.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stalls and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful coat of paint - something is going on here.
Then the May wreath was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to its winter quarters.
Many stalls catered for the physical well-being.
From sweet to savoury, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for one year, got creative at his scroll saw.
He offered veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and much more.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfeld offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig" (honey from Reckenfeld), brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter also brought a speciality.
Honey cake in a jar, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to reach for it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It was the conviviality that made the visitors stay long into the evening, even without the stage programme that is not part of the autumn festival.
Graffiti with a local political message: Not a successful advertisement for the skate park
In Lengerich, unknown persons have advertised for the construction of a skate park in a way that is hardly conducive.
According to Jürgen Kohne of the municipal administration, there are several places where such graffiti have been sprayed.
In at least one case, charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the career choice fair on 19 September, corresponding lettering had been discovered on the advertising sign on the stairway to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with a sharpie at the time, it could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the advertising sign in question will have to be replaced.
This case in particular is given a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also named on the sign.
If the skate park is built, its realisation should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of schools, sports and culture explains that there are already commitments without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical with the companies on the graffitied board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate parks for years.
After the old one at the LWL clinic was dismantled, the search for an alternative location began.
In the end, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this proposal was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building on this site.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The city council would then have the final say.
He assumes that a decision will be made this year, so that if the vote is positive, construction could begin in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck worsens
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
A major reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations, he said, was the long-known staff shortage at European air navigation services, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and the airports can achieve quick improvements for the coming year, but it takes four to five years to train new controllers," said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, he said, the market for fully trained controllers is empty.
The Karlsruhe centre alone, which monitors Germany's upper airspace, is short of about a hundred people.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions had not been invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the states, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports are meeting in the Hanseatic city on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it won't work without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned Deutsche Flugsicherung.
Maas again held the EU Commission's guidelines responsible for the air traffic controllers' plight.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff cuts at the national air navigation service providers are now having a full impact on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby in Brussels for regulations that would "not cut off the air even more" for the air navigation service providers.
At the moment, the EU regulations are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs would prompt a rethink among the airlines.
The GdF would only cooperate in improving the situation if the German Air Navigation Services (DFS) offered a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
He added that the intake of 120 trainee air traffic controllers per year over the next five years, as announced so far, was just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
This does not yet include the necessary increase in personnel.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp supervisory board have voted unanimously in favour of plans to restructure the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim boss Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There are to be no additional staff reductions beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body has only eight members on the capital side.
There are ten employee representatives.
However, the final decision is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 per cent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will bundle the lift and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have led to violent clashes with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday as about 6,000 pro-independence supporters also demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest marches away from each other with a large contingent.
According to the police, pro-independence demonstrators repeatedly tried to break through the security cordon.
They attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
There were also reportedly scuffles between the participants of the different protest marches.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said six arrests were made.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The policemen had wanted to honour their colleagues who took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government, almost exactly one year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez to the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who would only give his name as Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year were only doing their duty: defending the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to assert our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke", the policeman assured.
Glitch allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security flaw in a mobile phone app meant that the personal details of ministers and MPs from Britain's Conservative Tory Party were temporarily accessible to anyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the glitch became known a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top match
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with Valencia's half-hour", praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champions' 3-1 (1-1) win over SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuers, even without a goal of his own.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good on our first goal - and from that moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early with Dries Mertens' 10th-minute goal to edge past their closest rivals for the time being.
The Real Madrid-bound goalscorer first set up former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who scored a brace (26-49) to give Juve the lead.
Ronaldo also headed in a corner and set up defender Leonardo Bonucci's 76th goal, which he slotted home just before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri naturally wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Juve's top scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three to his name.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is their unblemished streak in Serie A. With 21 points, the champions of the past seven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.
The second-placed team, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without its chances against Torino.
But at the latest after the dismissal of Mario Rui (58.), who had already been cautioned, the top match was decided.
The Portuguese had to be sent off with a yellow card after a hard tackle on Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli," commented the coach from Turin.
Emre Can could also feel addressed.
The German international has asserted himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri referred to as the "half-hour": Ronaldo was sent off in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West attracted attention with a particularly bizarre performance on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, people should only call him "Ye", the musician said.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, however.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means "you"," said the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we hardly ever gave them any problems. Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's scoring opportunities reads thin.
Just two chances to score in 90 minutes - that is rarely enough to win a match.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar loses to SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two chances in the first half, but Maik Krause took the first one from an acute angle to take an early lead (7th minute).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased the lead, but after a great assist from Krause, he missed a free kick.
The hosts only had one double chance when Moritz Höne failed to beat goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper.
After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all missed.
A handball penalty - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and received a red card - was also not converted by Niklas Eilmann (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81st).
"We had criticised ourselves harshly beforehand, then today was different from the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus' conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh loses to Concordia 3:4
"I don't know what to make of that," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get any grip on them at all". By them, he presumably meant the wingers Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other Green-Whites who stood out with their collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winked cheekily and left. His players, on the other hand, were visibly relieved to have come away with three points.
Mind you, this was after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting to stay in the league.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandably mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he said.
"The way we came back after the 0:2, the way we held our own over the entire game against one of the top teams in the league, that was really phenomenal."
It was all the more bitter that they now had to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He set up the 2:0 perfectly for Fabian Fröhning on the left side (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that completely out of the game.
"It was amazing what he did," said Lewandowski, acknowledging the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the break, his own team equalised: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the far corner of the goal (45th).
After the change of ends, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59.).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh did not manage to counter the last Concordia goal (80th) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights for a point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leaders had actually travelled to Strassberg for three points, but coach Oliver Pfaff's team stood their ground very well and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Entire Dynamo Dresden executive committee resigns
According to media reports, the entire board of directors of second division football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets unanimously referred to a joint letter from the board of the Saxon club.
A confirmation from the club was not initially available.
The reason for the resignation is said to be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure causes such great relief in Germany as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Protestant Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Protestant Academy Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled his intention to collect the Tolerance Award in Tutzing in person.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Protestant Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us". However, the fact that celebrities always turn up at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will be at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed his attendance: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in person in Tutzing, which is also awarded to TV presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so conferences up to the middle of 2019 have a lot to offer.
"Pensions are not safe!" is the title of one conference.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - that's how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war makes a mockery of every humane idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalisation.
Academy Director Hahn expressed his conviction: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a conference on the 200th birthday of Karl Marx
At a conference on the 200th birthday of Karl Marx in the near future, some expect more visitors in the direction of capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency "from the far left to the centre".
What about neutrality?
"We are, after all, a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Evangelical Regional Church," said Director of Studies Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 per cent neutral."
Musical cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret performer, Teubner tackled gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth for the (perceived) woman and the (perceived) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the grand piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes gets to speak until the end of the movement, on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanies Teubner so congenially in harmony that some may have wished for a solo.
There was one too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely in a way that fitted the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the man's satisfaction comes when he has a partner but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo demonstrates the same thing: what would have come out of Mozart's compositions if "Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glided over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairperson, Heidemarie Markenbeck, did not miss an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk will be allowed to remain chairman of the board at electric car maker Tesla, but he will have to give up the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a fine in the double-digit millions, as the SEC announced.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement in August that he wanted to take Tesla off the stock exchange.
In its complaint, the SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Wuerttemberg, police have slightly revised the number of victims downwards.
They say that 10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
All of them have been released from hospital in the meantime.
The French bus driver remained in hospital for observation.
He would be released in the course of the day, a police spokesperson said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed head-on into a crash barrier without braking.
Handball: Women's regional league: Ahlen SG keeps clean sheet against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen team had problems with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals.
"Actually, I was satisfied with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We couldn't get a grip on her," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many missed chances.
This time, his team lacked concentration in their finishing.
ASG was trailing almost until the end, 11:12 at the break and 15:18 later (45th).
It was only towards the end that the hosts' wider bench made itself felt.
In addition, Aydogdu switched back Merle Klement to left wing, who then scored the "extremely clever goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The blue and white team won 3:1 at the second league relegated VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz happy to play in the top third of the league.
We've earned that now," coach Dominik Münch was pleased to say after an almost flawless performance by his team at the toppled league leaders.
The guests dominated the first half almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, it went to last year's runners-up with 25:15.
Essen took it in the two-all, but didn't get into the game.
We kept them well busy.
Our opponent served with high risk, but also produced quite a few driving shots.
In the second set, BSV was already leading 12:8. "Essen changed the reception to a three-setter.
We couldn't keep up the pressure on serve.
Essen sucked it in and we let ourselves get a bit lulled," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fought off four set points at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now in a better class," said the coach about the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serves to BSV turning the tide in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly.
After 7:3 and 15:13, the blue and white team won the fourth set 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way the large Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations that can only be swept together with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland.
Both the Turkish and the German side had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the affiliation of Muslims to Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the date for his own purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Nottuln local history association: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, it is finally folk meeting time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Nottuln Folklore Society will hold its fifth Nottuln Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
It is almost a year ago to the day that we held our first Folktreff.
In the meantime, this event has become a permanent fixture in the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
No matter whether it was storm Friederike in January or a heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sea shanties, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites musician friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion have agreed to play at the first Folktreff "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of Folktreff fondly remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten thrilled the audience with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" (Frogs in the Night) and sent them home with an earworm.
"We are counting on many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," says the invitation from the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and feels like getting actively involved is invited to join in.
Since the coveted seats are always taken quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair take another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gases group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-euro merger still has to be approved in South Korea and - the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
According to an insider, the chances of approval in the USA have improved because Linde has agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Landscape Management were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach clubhouse, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall on Saturday evening.
Of course, it had a different name back then: it was called the "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Countryside District Fruit Growers' Association) and was launched by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was indeed purely about fruit-growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture back then.
"At that time, in the epoch of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite of the elites," explained district curator of local history Günter Dippold in his celebratory lecture.
Fruit trees were to line long-distance roads, and so-called industrial gardens were planted near schools.
Today, fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is by no means exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as imparting knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (Moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and Mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with smartphones & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they are to be planted is decided by the district association," added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district was also left in no doubt by district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a pictorial presentation and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden and was canned for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden had changed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," pleaded the fruit and nut tree expert.
Therefore, he said, the horticultural associations have the incentive not to slacken their efforts so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, president of the Bavarian state association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline of insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower wind players of the Thurnau music association.

Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: they give both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech at the United Nations.
Due to time pressure in the struggle for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the minister will address the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesperson Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, she said, she would focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had said on Friday that Canadian and US negotiators had 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada really wanted to join the trade deal already struck between his country and the US.
The USA and Mexico had agreed on a new version of the regional free trade agreement Nafta in August.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new version have been going on for more than a year.
They are to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In case the negotiations fail, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the far-right ex-military man wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
Following his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked in the street during an election rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), mainly women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military leader.
The associations also mobilised on social networks against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-mayor of the megacity São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If neither candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a runoff on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successful from this - regardless of who he runs against.
Bolsonaro is known for his incitement against homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again he shocks with verbal lapses.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula's leftist Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers wrote another Ryder Cup fairytale on the doorstep of Paris.
In front of more than 150,000 spectators at Le Golf National, the underdog team of captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favoured defending champion USA around a toothless Tiger Woods with great shots and outstanding team spirit.
Danish rock legend dies after long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band broke up in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone's heart".
The head of government also recalled that Larsen, an opponent of the monarchy, had performed at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a paraphrase of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Schuhfabrik community centre: pure hard rock from three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - visibly enthuse the 120 or so visitors to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the audience danced to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although there were shouts of "encore", "Tiger Bonesaw" left the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that not all hard rock is the same with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesiser is used in addition to the guitar rock on "Here We Stand".
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special reputation since its formation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the interplay with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound, which feels even higher than before, as he walks through the audience.
A certain volume is naturally part of a hard rock concert of this kind: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the volume of the three-piece concert by "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is around 98 decibels.
That is about the level of a jackhammer, but still well below the output of the "Wacken Festival", which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
The audience in Ahlen, however, does not need the deafening 120 decibels at jet-propelled volume that is usual at the annual metal festival in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rockier kind have long since convinced the audience with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we are, having taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, admittedly in a figurative sense.
And, above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a glider had crashed at the airport's fairground car park.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the student pilot was alone on board - the aircraft is said to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the aircraft was already on its approach to land.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
However, an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the slip road to the 52 motorway.
There is a Park&Ride service from the car park during large events at Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love".
It is no secret that the US president is quite sympathetic to North Korea's ruler Kim despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a downright declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has declared his love for a new flame.
The tragedy: It is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-aged scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, even though he is proving to be quite a tough cookie in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough as nails, he was tough as nails, and we went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the conversations with Kim that melted his heart, he said.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics see little more than lip service behind it so far.
The US president seemed to be well aware that his affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - who is notorious for his martial threatening gestures, might not be comfortable for everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this right away during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they're in love".
How awful, how awful is that?
That is so unpresidential.
He doesn't care, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential.
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there crowding into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well-attended, full of atmosphere and sunshine: Baesweiler's city centre was decked out in a very varied way and with a good dash of Oktoberfest flair on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees used a mobile phone video to draw attention to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, thus making their rescue possible.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at the risk of their lives and circulated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website France 24 Observers, whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, I don't think we could have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
According to his own statement, he put his life in danger with the video.
One of his comrades-in-arms was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, he said, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the rescued Nigerians is not unusual, given the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to Ort primary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised an intruder.
At around 4:50 pm, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the vestibule of the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then via the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who took up the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether objects or money were stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, somewhat darker in appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please send any information to the Obernberg am Inn police station, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German man was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man was forced to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Middle Franconia after he got the car stuck off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by chance not far from a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man, who had been missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He stated that he was now looking forward to being at home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a trip in his off-road vehicle across local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister President Armin Laschet (CDU) said that he called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to Laschet, he also mentioned the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
In response, Erdogan again emphasised the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The meeting between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's Air Readiness Centre at Cologne airport.
Originally, the meeting was to have taken place at Schloss Wahn, but the owners of the castle refused to allow it because of their political convictions against Erdogan.
After the meeting, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance at the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasising the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the situation more soberly.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to make concessions.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US administration at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes from the US relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances, he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat elaborated.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, Ri emphasised that his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility.
However, the minister criticised that there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
In recent days, US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to strictly enforce the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's strongman Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.
HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The many visitors to the HoT open house were unaware that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the congregation, for which the young people wanted to thank them with the meal.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the nasty surprise on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of action, the food had spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone pitched in.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Cooks can't do any better than this," said an impressed visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, meat loaf or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put together," emphasised pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed everyone with card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board of Tafel
Frustrated by criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced an admission ban for foreigners.
Sartor told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" that he had already resigned as vice-chairman of the NRW Tafel in July.
Too many people stabbed me in the back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the NRW Tafel association, expressed understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy to the dpa.
He said Sartor had taken the sharp criticism in his stride.
"I can understand his step - there were people who spoke out who didn't really know why the Essener Tafel was doing this."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing will change", Weilerswist said.
Sartor in turn criticised colleagues from other food banks in the "Welt am Sonntag".
One should not take the approach that "without us, the people in the city will starve".
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a congress of the food banks in Berlin on Friday.
"There's too much sweet talk going on there," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who also criticised me so much back then.
SF Lorch squander 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after trailing - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
Lorch was already 2:0 ahead in their home match against TV Neuler - in the end the score was 2:3 and the disappointment of the Sportfreunde was great.
TV Heuchlingen was a completely different story: In Kirchheim, TVH quickly fell behind 0:1, but won 2-1 after 90 minutes. Meanwhile, at the top of the table, SGB won 3:0.
Gladbach squander two leads - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
The Foals squandered a lead twice in a 2-2 draw.
Schalke achieved their first win of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Schalke have conceded early goals four times in their first five league games.
Now, Domenico Tedesco's team showed the same strength that had helped them finish first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf gave the home team the lead in the eleventh minute with a header after strong preparation by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is now at the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had trailed Bayer Leverkusen 0:2 until the break, but came back in the 2nd half to win 4:2.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning glory with another double in the final phase (86th/94th) for the improved performance after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won for the first time.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart team had to struggle for a while.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in own goal which helped the visitors to equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro gave VfB their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not have a completely successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach, but neither was it a failure.
The Gladbach team with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave away a lead, ultimately playing 2-2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser at 1-1 with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was helpless against the Aargau native's low shot from 20 metres, just as he was when he conceded the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies of Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goal-scorer for the Foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record acquisition from OGC Nice scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh match.
After seven rounds Gladbach are in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter-attack, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic put his team under further pressure: The 23-year-old Serbian was shown a yellow card for pulling Daniel Didavi's jersey.
Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in goal (68th), but Gonzalo Castro put Stuttgart back on the road to victory with a quarter of an hour to go.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens will vote today on whether the name of their country should be changed to North Macedonia.
If they vote yes, the conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has been smouldering for almost three decades, could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement of Macedonia with the West.
The voters will therefore also decide on the future integration with the West.
The USA had announced that the country could quickly become a member of Nato if the referendum results were positive.
Syrian in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three female pensioners, injuring some of them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had been on the rampage in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund at around 10 pm on Friday.
When the police officers arrived, they spoke to the accused, who was attacking passers-by with clenched fists, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to punch and kick the officers.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had shortly before beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons", according to the police.
He was taken to the hospital and was continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into effect, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two got married on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we marry, then we will marry properly". He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesperson of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption rights.
Gardening day: 400 metres of hedge trimmed
The members of the Kinderhaus Civic Association and the Society for Leprosy Studies had a lot of work ahead of them.
About 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus had to be cut.
Supported by the residents, about twelve supporters went to work.
"We do this to reduce costs," explained Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens' association.
And quite a lot had accumulated.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a topiary.
Because the hedge had already been shorn once in the spring.
Breakfast, which always follows work, also has a long tradition.
"After all, we all want to keep our strength up," says Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old had a perfect run on the Olympic course on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I've had enough rides here on the course and everything went well today," said the London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist.
At the finish line, he threw away his paddle in joy and raised both arms in victory - knowing full well that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he had bib number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second place went to the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police department reported the first attempted burglary of this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
Yesterday, the Gauting police reported the first attempted burglary of this autumn.
The fact that the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße was successful was due to the alarm system.
It went off when the perpetrators tried to break in shortly before 8 pm on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without any loot.
Information to the Gauting police, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Crash at Hertha: Caught up with reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The title of unbeatable is gone: FC Bayern "won't put up with" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first interim conclusion to Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small dip in performance under new coach Niko Kovac should by no means escalate into a major autumnal low for the Munich side.
"A week ago you still had the impression we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League clash with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that this really annoys us and that's why we're stepping on the gas in the direction of Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, we haven't scored a goal of our own away from home, we've gone two games in a row without a win, and we've lost the lead in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is nowhere near as dramatic as it was during the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti's reign at the end of September 2017, the record champions must nevertheless be warned.
FC Augsburg, with their run-intensive man-to-man tactics, and the Berliners, with their playful pinpricks via the flanks, have provided two blueprints in the space of three days as to how the Bavarians, who have recently appeared overpowering, can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we won't put up with that and we will do everything to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city, blaming his first defeat as Munich coach merely on another poor handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second top flight appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who had also beaten AEK Athens 3-0 in the opening game, will begin as planned.
"Now it's got us in two games, but we will score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The right-back appeared in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work for it again because we don't create the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympiastadion.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were even already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken over the top spot again with a one-point lead.
And so, with a twinkle in his eye, Kimmich at least considered it positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the firing line: Özil affair: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with severe accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees fault, but defends the association's line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretative sovereignty in the permanent dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association's line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who had been sharply attacked by Özil himself, announced the consequences of the affair in the ZDF "Sportstudio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we must draw very precise conclusions so that something like this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win over a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
The latter had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the level of the German national team, were ostracised.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he had felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.
For someone to say: if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, that's what I've always said.
But he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team either.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed alongside Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background were to have a clear impact on society and football and say: "This topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year.
"I am doing my job and striving to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old man causes three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic lights in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal details, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, the police received a phone call about a driver who had driven off the road and hit a reflector post.
When asked about this, the man did not want the police there and then drove off.
The man from Rödental then drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his home town, where he has lived for decades, and hit a construction vehicle while turning around.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed clear signs of accident damage.
The 75-year-old looked confused and could not remember much.
The damage amounts to about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Still almost 1000 emergency personnel in action.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moorland fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland region, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a spokesperson, as the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteer helpers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it said.
An above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished on Sunday night.
Last week, the state of emergency, which had been declared a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighbouring forests and settlements due to wind and flying sparks.
On Thursday, it was announced that there was no longer any danger of the fire spreading to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 firefighters were on the scene trying to get the blaze under control.
The German Air Force continues to support the work at the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are again planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
At times, the smoke plume from the moorland fire had travelled up to a hundred kilometres across north-western Germany, as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point to receive reports of damage.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said "I do" in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for them, Kahrs had previously told the newspaper "Bild".
If we marry, then we marry properly.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesperson of the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption rights.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state name begins
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
Neighbouring Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement of Skopje with the EU and Nato for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also be giving the starting signal for their country's integration into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saved the Shoah from Oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on 30 September.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the USA in 2016, leaving behind a body of work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Their wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still - as in Germany - only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant emphasises.
It is assumed that 15 per cent of Swiss citizens have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases is a card found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In over 60 per cent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, Marita Völker-Albert, spokesperson for the Federal Centre for Health Education, is considering storing information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless they or relatives object.
Among others, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in mental arithmetic.
He beat 39 competitors in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese schoolboy, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball in the air with his head while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß already took part two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue has little use for terms like super brain, genius or child prodigy.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised for several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even arithmetic competitions in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, taking the square root of six-digit numbers.
In the eventuality arithmetic, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, the Germans also have good chances, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians often have an advantage because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods at an early age.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about early breast cancer detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her soulful and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and advocate early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and education.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams almost died herself a year ago.
There were complications during the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation was performed to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" for review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Next week, Frau Holle will shake out her beds in the West for the first time: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, Northern Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow line will drop to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 metres if the intensity is high, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow could be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), road conditions will therefore be wintry.
Farmers may start annual kink maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual curtilage maintenance on Monday.
The "green walls", which are unique in Germany, have characterised the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The up to five-metre-wide hedges of trees and scrub are "forest substitutes" and the last refuges for many animals and plants.
Knicks act as corridors connecting scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the Executive Director of the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The curtilages were created by order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name, "Knick", also dates from that time: the dense, interwoven boundaries could develop by "bending over" the branches.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the impression of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as substitute habitats by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species can live in one kilometre of hedgerow and up to 30 pairs of birds can breed there.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it degenerates into a sparse row of trees, which loses not only its biodiversity but also its windbreak effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink maintenance may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
Indonesian talks about local situation after tsunami in Sulawesi
In an interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on the ground yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport in Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying outside their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery shops and also the petrol stations are completely closed, people are sometimes stealing food and petrol.
Public services are completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the inmates are running around freely and it is difficult to search for them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information through the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people they don't know if they are alive and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but away at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the all-clear came, many thought "OK, no tsunami" - and then it did come.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a muscle fibre in his left rear thigh during the 2-1 defeat to Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club announced on Sunday.
Doctors diagnosed Donis with a torn muscle bundle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a prognosis on the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fibre tear usually heals somewhat faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - Every year, the San Sebastián Film Festival closes the round of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the doomsaying about cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong entries from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that managed to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, walkers on the Olching lake noticed a white, injured duck.
It was in the area of the water rescue station.
In order to help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, it managed to evade the emergency services again and again.
In the end, it fled into the lake.
Using a rescue boat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and force it back onto land, where it was then put into a transport crate by a fireman with a courageous grip after almost an hour.
The duck, injured in the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleissheim.
But according to initial assessments, its chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for world championship medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was on biathlete Julian Eberhard's mind for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfelden native wants to make up for the missed medal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The 31-year-old's last shot in the Olympic sprint in Pyeongchang cost him a medal that was within his grasp.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
"I deliberately gave myself time to process that," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgau native is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come to a major event in good shape again, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) suits Eberhard: "I have already taken the track to my heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition in Kontiolahti (FIN) in the past World Cup winter.
With the relay team he finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.
With a turbo-charged FBI investigation, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for the controversial judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh because of allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to resolve the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which has been accompanied by a culture clash, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist launched angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative US Supreme Court justice.
The Republican majority seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared that he would agree but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party colleagues agreed.
President Trump, who had still called the serious accusations a "scam" on Thursday, initially refrained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely narrowed the powers of the investigators.
They will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, nothing more, a government official told the "Wall Street Journal": "They're not going on a fishing expedition".
According to the "New York Times", only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile radar unit installed in a "civilian vehicle" by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October, according to the municipality.
The federal school centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist when it comes to football matches.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said Schalke 04's sports director - and breathed a sigh of relief.
In the end, the Königsblauen managed to hold on for a narrow 1:0 win over the Rheinhessen and thus secure their first victory of the season.
It could have been a different story.
After Alessandro Schöpf's 11th-minute lead had given head coach Domenico Tedesco's team a sense of security, Tedesco: "All in all, the first half was good, both in terms of play and pressing", as the game wore on, it was obviously more and more the head that played a role.
Schöpf not really a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me," Heidel said, "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to let it slip out of their hands and therefore kept pulling back.
And defended with all their might against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"It was a huge weight off everyone's mind," said Schöpf, who played no small part in the victory with his header: "I'm actually the worst header in the team.
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable in the entire arena, of course also for Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the opening phase and make fireworks out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, that's how we have to approach games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon was that Königsblau failed to create a clearer situation.
The opportunities were there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a nail-biting victory," said Tedesco: "You could feel the fear a little bit.
That's why I'm glad that we won.
He was not the only Schalker with that.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke visible in Leitzach valley for 2 km
The smoke could not be missed.
From a distance of about two kilometres, a hiker in the Leitzach valley observed a fire at about 1.30 p.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to rubbish on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appeared that he had supervised the fire for some time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing the fire.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Standing in front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild for the second time.
"I have made it my business, for many years now, to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and a joke or two, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflictual topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first-generation migrants at the other.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one is politically on the right or the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?
At the beginning, the discussion is rather restrained, but then it gets more and more lively.
And there is a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of, not on, the stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasises that he is talking about the average, not individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent book-signing session, he still had an open ear for the guests' questions and there was also intensive further discussion in the foyer over prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn ended the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought match in their own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against Mitteldeutsche BC.
The ambitious Bonn team won 86-79 (49-47) at BG Göttingen.
Alba Berlin are the first league leaders of the season after their 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
German champions Bayern Munich and former series champions Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the start of the new season.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 win at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, while Bamberg won the Franconian derby at s.Oliver Würzburg 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots of land
The demand is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the plots in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the Landsham-Süd development area on the open market.
This was announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local residents' model - has been completed.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being checked" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Pliening mayor, the goal is to have the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to present it to the municipal council.
After that, the allocation could take place.
A total of 50 plots for detached and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with probably eight residential units each.
In the meantime, the development is almost completed, and the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
One single plot and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
The municipality sells most of the plots on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings owned by the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-generating flats subsidised by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, living space for about 200 people will be created on the site of the Landsham-Süd development area.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, the construction of a new day-care centre for children will start there, according to Frick.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is planned for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo succeeds in "great sport" even on the bench
Not in the starting eleven for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues was not in the starting eleven for the third time in a row, but on the substitutes' bench, many people would have been very understanding if the almost two-metre tall Brazilian had really got his frustration off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity's sake, intervened and said; "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who harboured no resentment despite being a reserve again.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalke player last season, knows that he has not actually been sidelined by his coach - but is being given a break for good reason.
A reason called "load management".
It was not easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'll tell you that in all honesty," Tedesco recounted the moment he told Naldo he was not in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always back to the matter at hand, it's about the club," Tedesco said, explaining the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we keep everyone on board," said Tedesco, explaining the rotation that has also caught Naldo lately.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving to be an exemplary team player even on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its downward slide in August at an accelerated pace compared to the Eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best sentiment in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday regarding its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50-point mark, which indicates growth, for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industrial sector cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks (42.1 points) brought up the rear.
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but at a slower pace than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
"While the slightly softer slide could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains - in the third quarter anyway - the number one brake on growth.
A quick return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell more sharply than at any time since November 2011.
Companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially expected.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the index surveys developments in sales, employment, inventories and prices.
Tuchel's PSG side manage eighth win in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
The defending champions won 3-0 (1-0) at OGC Nice thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and were successful in their eighth league match.
The last time Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France was 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar gave PSG the lead after 22 minutes and set up the final goal in stoppage time.
Christopher Nkunku (46) made it 2-0 in the meantime.
The win also gave Paris a dress rehearsal for their crucial second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
Tuchel's team had suffered its only defeat in a competitive match so far this season, losing 3-2 at Liverpool.
