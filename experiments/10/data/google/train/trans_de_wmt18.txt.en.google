Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks. "The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, scheduled to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extra caution and caution when traveling through the state, as a A number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred across the state and are noted here," the group's statement said. A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel advisory, the NAACP said. "They have civil rights violations that happen to people. They get stopped because of the color of their skin, they get beat up or they get killed," Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star. "We're hearing complaints at a rate we've never heard before." It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States. The group cited incidents including racial abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black Tennessee man. Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime. The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's office showing that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites. "The recommendation is that people be aware and let their families, friends and associates know what could be happening in Missouri," Chapel said. "People have to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling across the state." Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the country for the number of such violations. The travel advisory is also in response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination. Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling. Travel advisories are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have deployed the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
Is nothing sacred anymore? Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues. Americans value this as much as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003. Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he delivered a symbolic Ax took him to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the President's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration. To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself. A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it. But he attacked its meaning, and particularly the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument's completion. As Miller berated Acosta, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is...a symbol of American liberty that lights up the world. The poem you're referring to, which was added later and wasn't is part of the original Statue of Liberty." Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history. It's about the contemporary resonance of the rousing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely / the wretched refuse of your rich shores." There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" on our screens has been more visible. Miller didn't engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States. This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America. Lazarus - and her friends, who worked to get her words out on the grassroots after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act. The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of liberty in a worn classic pictorial representation. Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice. And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles. The pairing of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism. And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing people have long wanted to change it back. Big shouter Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty isn't inviting anyone but rather an early neocon bringing the American flame to the bedraggled world: "Lady Liberty is leading the way. She shall carry the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world. The torch shall not light the way to the United States." Quite unusually, Limbaugh stumbled upon something here. The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perspective. The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen on the decks of ships by the weary, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys. It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking sanctuary and a chance to improve their lives. Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear. And that, of course, isn't the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge. Her torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is her only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team". A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday. Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics needs to learn something from it. "We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to keep it going until we find out," Black said. "I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done. The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done. British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did. And also with the guy on the street corner. Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant." Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will face Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the squad to be team captain. "Eilidh is quite humble. Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated. The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great. " The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m at her fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the British team. Scotland's best ever total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015. Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year. She will compete in the 1,500m and 5,000m races. Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games. Doyle remembers their first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell. The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but will also, in some cases, be involved in the medals and finals. "What's special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me is empowering made it very special to me," she added. "Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team. It just goes to show how far we've come. And they're here as established athletes, athletes looking to climb podiums. As for my speech as captain? Yes , I think it went well, I was just pointing out that we are very lucky in this situation because we have a home World Cup, so it's really important to bet on that home support and take advantage of the fact that we're back are at the Olympic Stadium. I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don't Run for Public Office If You Can't Take Voter Bashing The father of our country knew about bad press. Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers slammed him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles. He scolded the criticism, sure. But he has not silenced his critics. For in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we shall be led like sheep to the slaughter." This brings me to Maryland to see Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington. Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page. And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him over it earlier this week. The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was rife with a "So what?" backlash. . "It's just Facebook," many people said. But it's important. And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan. This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state who is amazingly popular. He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors. Hogan is not a reactionary hothead. He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles. He was also very adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents and easily debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side. Therefore, blocking people from coming to the governor's side — which is a public forum pretended to be official and employees paid in public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation. But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people wielding the whip online. The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan. And these are just real people speaking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a minister, not trolls. They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane. The minister quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith. Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md. was not hateful, but did ask about hate crimes. "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post news show. "I don't like that idea either, if a number of people comment on the same issue, then some tend to disregard them as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens." What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would likely call "advocacy." The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment. It's a lot cleaner than it used to be if they had done the same thing, dispatched staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters. But that's exactly what's happening digitally right now. Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media. President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked from his Twitter feed. One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week. The chairman of Loudoun County's Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page. And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter. That shouldn't be that difficult. In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had a similar impact to the Internet. The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers lashed out at its leadership. And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls. The people using pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers blasting Washington's decisions. Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers. But he didn't shut her up. Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are fundamental to our nation. And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club Former European No1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open. The Northern Irishman, who led to the finals next door at Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and is acting as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi. "I saw the Renaissance Club being built and we see it achieve its glory with this event," said Rafferty. "Players will see this course at its best, it's in great condition. Jerry did a great job setting this place. He's a fervent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievement here. This is a great showcase for this course." England's Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career. "It feels really special," said the Southport-based player. "I wasn't able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was canceled the year after I won it. Coming back to this part of the world is magical. It's a wonderful place to play golf. The memories from the last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year. It was a really special time and one we will always cherish." Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, returns to action on home soil. This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013. "It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the Helensburgh man. "You want to do well but you also feel that extra pressure. I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf. I'm happy with how it's gone so far." Joining the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty. Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond. Entry is free, parking is £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants. All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's land of gold When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove. In fact, she rarely uses a pot. In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - known locally as a "nota" - right in the fireplace. After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with eager, unwashed hands. Degei sits on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp. A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine. As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields. Polygamy is common here. Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here. "Nobody dares walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says. It's a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony recorded in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when just 1,026 elders were to vote by public census before occupying forces. An existing pro-independence movement against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and bars foreign journalists or legal observers. In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island. Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning drive by rental car. There is no public transport. The town of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs that have been rusted to various hues of tawny. Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners. Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee. There were other changes too. "We weren't used to wearing those clothes," Degei says, hinting at her vibrant, handwoven turban, dark shirt, and light-colored skirt. "We used to only have leaves on our bodies." Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and has some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia. But it is also Indonesia's gold country. The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized upland province with a population of 153,000. In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper. In addition, Papua has timber resources valued at an estimated US$78 billion. However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence. A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer. Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are being treated mercilessly. According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969. Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission. In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year. "We Will Lose Everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, including unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution being particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations. "It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch. The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia. The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi. Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce. Local people struggle to keep up here. "Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work. "It has cost the native Papuans — the mama-mama [the women] of Papua — their market." Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign. The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta. But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed. "Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says. In fact, Paniai hit rock bottom just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October. On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers burst through the darkness on a motorbike. The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights. One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai. The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and hit the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said. Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children. One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma. A few hours later, the nearby Government Commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day. About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice. They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - walking in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe. Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts. When the atmosphere heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers over an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them dead," according to an official TIME document, which has not been released to local media. Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the looming danger and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home. Nobody was in the mood to listen. "As I turned around, I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house. Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from among the soldiers gathered here. "It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds. Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings. "I ran to him and checked his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, told TIME in a somber mood. "I saw that he was dead... I kissed him." Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was under attack. "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015. "It's a matter of life and death." According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured. News of the killings was filtered to Jakarta the following day. For three weeks, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address historical grievances in Papua. "I want this case to be solved immediately so that it doesn't happen again in the future," he said. Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations. But the excuses started almost immediately. "Most of the violations occurred a long time ago. Some were in the 90's and early 2000's. The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed," he said. Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua. Instead, "everything will be regulated by law," he said. Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for "crimes against humanity" that left more than 1,000 dead in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident. Families of the Paniai victims met such claims with grim disbelief. "I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there hasn't been any progress," says Yohanes. "I am tired." He says years later he still lives in fear. "I'm scared," he says. "I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot." His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident. He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims. "After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says. The shootings haven't stopped. On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood. One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company, which refused to take an unconscious man to hospital. The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital. Excited villagers protested outside the company's on-site office. Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots. But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one. "We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME. "I hid in my house for two days." The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area. Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government. The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribesmen living in Papua's verdant highlands. Many have joined the Free Papuan Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to be defending Papuans' rights by instigating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers. Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya. In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretense of "securing national sovereignty". Some never show up again. Paniai is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic, forgotten place". Poverty increases dissatisfaction. What little rice is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals. Bread is just as out of reach. People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy greens. Farming is the job of the women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes. They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold at the local market. Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents). Over time, economic disparities have grown between native Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since new flight routes to Nabire Airport opened. The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and wealthier migrants. Papuans rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively. "The young people are not interested in staying in the village...because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, head of the Paniai tribal council. Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua. In addition, international media coverage restrictions remain strained. Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film. According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not materialized. "There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement. A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors. In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting. The same countries have historically supported the OPM. Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases." Local people want more foreign governments to take notice. When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting but wish to remain anonymous. Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again. "Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, the head of the tribal council. He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under constant threat from a predatory military, find themselves in poor education and health services. Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay. "They don't need money, they just want justice," he says. Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried at a compound just opposite the police and military station. They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes. "A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says, head bowed. "What else can we do?"
Fires engulf Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time A fire raged at one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-storey building. It's the second fire to sweep through what happens to be the Torch Tower in just two years. The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no direct word as to the cause of the blaze. "We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people screaming. We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident, who gave his name as George stated, Reuters. Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building. The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected. The incident may reignite questions about the safety of materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world. An investigation by management of the Torch Building following its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was from the siding, the siding for decoration or insulation. In Britain, police said they believe the insulation and cladding panel system on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed around 80 people.
More than 1 in 5 US travelers brings prohibited items on plane, survey finds A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent, who boarded the aircraft while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other bladed items. Less than 1 percent claimed they belatedly discovered they had inadvertently traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives. The survey of more than 1,000 people -- conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. -- also found younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules. Of those respondents who admitted they knowingly attempted to fly something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X. The most common items intentionally smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids. More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying bladed objects through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs onto the plane. The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally got contraband through airport security and how many did it intentionally. It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly the most. However, the company points out that TSA policies are a bit complicated and confusing. People are often unsure about which liquids they can take with them or how much of them. So it's no surprise that the largest quantity of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids. For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband. Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns for delaying Obama-era emissions reduction rules A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to implement the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants. Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental agencies. He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court. It's about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone. Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth." Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's Attorney prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations. Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly taken action to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose. Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda. Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority in attempting to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks. In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards is simply increasing EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in a timely manner. "Under previous administrations, the EPA has often missed deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others and come to an agreement to schedule the implementation," said Pruitt, who has guided the EPA to more than a dozen Mal in his previous job. "We don't believe in regulation by lawsuits and we take deadlines seriously. We also take seriously the law and the authority that gives us." Still, EPA's statement said that at some point Pruitt will use its "authority to delay and any other legally available powers" to ensure the rules are "based on sound policy and the best information available." Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules. A bill approved last month would delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years. The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep the legal pressure going. "EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smog pouring into their communities," said Schneiderman. New York in this case joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia. Ground ozone is formed when pollutants from automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight. The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups of people, and contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year. Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course. "It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity. "We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests."
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were released by the Washington Post. On Jan. 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena, Trump urged Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall. The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall. He reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that." Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border and vowing to make Mexico pay for the project. Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange. Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that a deal for the US to take on refugees migrating to Australia was "ridiculous", "lousy" and "stupid" and that insisting on the deal being brokered by the Obama administration , would make him look like an "idiot" after proposing a ban on resettling refugees in the US. Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most awkward call of the day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as Call for Justice A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a crowd of bystanders in rural Monroe, Georgia and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge. Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path. The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield. Inside, the inmates hovered in fear. "We want that n----r Roger!" the man yelled. "Get him out of the car!" Screams shattered the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat. Luckily, that horrifying scene that played out on July 22nd is just a re-enactment. But then, when a noose is thrown around "Roger's" neck, almost everyone in the audience let out very genuine sighs. Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946. No one was ever charged with the murders. "It's really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping organize the reenactment. "It's a smudge on a story, but it's a burden on our souls." Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia State Congressman and lifelong civil rights activist. For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that a wrong has never been righted. "We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said. "We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice." A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946. According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were killed in the lynching process suspected. But none have ever been charged. Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings have always been citywide well-known: politics and sex. In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black Georgia citizens to vote in the summer primary for the first time. Around the same time as the election, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed and stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman, according to the FBI. Brooks said the rumor around town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's. On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to break Malcom out of prison, according to the FBI. He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey. But as they walked away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car. "As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings," concludes an FBI report. "It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the killings, removing evidence and covering up the identities of witnesses." Brooks put it even more succinctly. "It was a suffrage massacre," he said. "They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is going to happen to you." For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has hosted the annual Moore Ford re-enactment Bridge Lynch murders. Her portrayal is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America. It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said, that's the point."We don't want to talk about lynching because then we're going to be confronted with the ugliness of it in all of us," she said. "But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't want to or don't listen to me want what I've been through." Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and the first day was packed with nearly 30 actors -- a dozen white and the rest Black arze - into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the piece. Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here. He's played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier. "I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said. "But I think it's very important to keep that story alive because we don't want to go back to those times." Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines. The play begins with Malcom yelling and harassing Hester, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy. "I said, n---er, get off my property!" Rascona returns fire. There is a break. And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts out laughing. Greene laughs the loudest. "What?!" Rascona asked. He is alarmed and confused. was i too hard "No," Greene said, still giggling. "I just don't think white people said 'n---er' back then." "Yes," one of the other black cast members quipped. "You just have to type the hard 'R.' meet." And that's where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replacing the uneasiness. Everyone is busy trying to get this right, not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people that were killed. The scene begins again. This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully. Absolutely nobody laughs. This repetition ends violently and quickly. There are screams, gunshots and then silence. A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy, "Strange Fruit." Her voice breaks at every second word. About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes. The audience is almost evenly split between black and white. A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many just coming down the street. They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the Malcom and Dorsey burial grounds. Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels ghostly. As the last notes of the song play out, Greene invites the crowd to come over and inspect the bodies. Children perch on their heads, registering the fake blood and still bodies, and whispering to each other. "You're not really dead," a little boy murmurs, as if trying to remember. After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over. The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears. Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clanmate. Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then collapses in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through. "It's okay," whispers one of the women. "We know it's not in your heart. You did it for a reason." Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner. At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about a re-enactment with a black couple they've just met. Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for the feeling the performance left behind. "It's hard to hear those horrific words and actions ... coming from people who look like you and who are doing it because they look like you," she said. "What this is really doing to me makes me believe the lynching is still going on," she added, "nowadays it's just called a police shooting." In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eats, and commemorates civil rights. He said he has already started planning next year's performance. "The re-enactment is inspiring in a way as it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a learning moment," he said. "The thing is, if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again. If you don't study your own history, if you don't know your own history, you're doomed to repeat it."
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to deal with the pressure that the company is facing. The job cuts, which CEO John Fallon announced will mostly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which already saw 4,000 job losses. Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by a further £300m ($394m) in a third cost-cutting program to revitalize a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning. The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after posting a 1 percent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say. A NATO statement said five soldiers and one interpreter were injured. According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in Qarabagh district. The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - killing more than 30 people at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday. A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday. A NATO statement said the blast happened Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device". The statement said all of the injured were in stable condition and being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital, in the first half of 2017. In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul, the Taliban said would have carried out this attack.On May 31, a massive bombardment in the center of the city killed meh r than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001. The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police forces. Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision delaying regulation by the Obama administration that requires states to curb smog-causing emissions. This comes a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move. The EPA late Wednesday announced the decision to move forward with what it calls the "2015 ozone regulations," saying it shows the agency's commitment to working with states. "We believe in engaging with and responding to our government partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement. Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to extend ozone regulations - which will measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year, to October 2018 to delay. A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal. President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump said is designed to boost economic growth. But the effort has sparked backlash from Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the public health impact of larger emissions. The EPA's website says that breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko Meet for the First Time, Discuss a Possible Showdown Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most thrilling under-147-pound boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday. They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Featherweight Champion. Following Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list. Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion? I wish you the best of luck." Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN. As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas remarked that a potential showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect scale". "I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled. "I went up for Broner [to 140lbs] but I'm not that tall. I'm short to 140. I want to get down to lightweight. And he has to move down to lightweight [135lbs] and then we fight. That demands it the fans. Let's give that to them." Lomachenko agreed. "Boxing needs this fight." Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko, with a 135-pound debut, will have to fight this year to set a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts ) who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23rd. "This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking for it," Garcia said, later opening up about fighting at the network that offers the best financial package. We are the best. No other name can garner that kind of attention. Whenever they're ready..." Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is "a tremendous fighter" and he may take part in his Saturday fight. But Lomachenko paused in the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the Riverside three-way champion look"very slow, sorry Mikey...you wanted the knockout". Garcia said the focus is showing punching power, then boxing. Both said they could have the momentum, that was building up for one's struggle." This is the struggle that must be carried out. No other fight creates so much attention and excitement. I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said. Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mikey. It's going to be a great fight."
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medically assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results. The Swedish Board of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year. They are said to make age assessments more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who were minors. To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017. Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older". In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18". The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question. According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months. "We don't see a big difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local magazine. The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age. In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "suggested that the person tested was 18 years of age or older." When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases the person had openly stated that they would be 18 that year. The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some quarters. One skeptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual. "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used. Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain. If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend if we could," he told the Metro newspaper. However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small. The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in In this case, it's about 10 percent."
The governor of West Virginia announces he is changing parties. West Virginia's Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would switch parties. Like it or not, the Democrats have walked away from me," Gov. Justice said. "Today, with much prayer and much thought, I will tell you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I will tell you, I cannot help more if I'm a Democratic governor." The rally erupted in cheers. "Tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to Republican," Justice added. "As a coach, I would say it's time to change Game to play." Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally. Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes , was elected in 2016. Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father, and is worth approximately $1.59 billion The Blican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night, saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again." "At just 15 governorates and the scrutiny of few legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection from a party that is top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," said the RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as a blatant apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport. Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping. He said he feels sorry for "all the athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched away in competitions." Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia. "I thought it was a very candid response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters. "The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has been through some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped." Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia was accepting the criteria for his reinstatement. "I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said. "We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation. The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added start in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria, as neutral actors. IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement. Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after speaking at the IAAF Council.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris The rules, aimed at preventing free spending by European football clubs, will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain. Any consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing body overseeing European play has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament. Financial fair play rules, instituted by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses. Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year. Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France. PSG can certainly cash in on Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars given the team's funding from Qatar's energetic ruling family. Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but must counter this with legitimate revenue streams that allow them to break even in their football-related business. FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007. The former French player believed clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support. In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debt to monitoring their losses. The change meant the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - was to become a tougher proposition. During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can sustain losses of 30 million euros. And despite Platini falling out of favor from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to discouraging excessive spending. "Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week. Although PSG paid Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, they can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract. Neymar has signed a five-year contract, meaning that the transfer fee for the next five years can be reported in the financial statements at €44.4m. The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City. PSG were fined €60m ($82m at the time), which was later reduced to €20m - and ordered the squad for the 2014/15 Champions League to be reduced to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited. UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that might try to outsmart their financial regulators by inflating their revenue through companies linked to a club's owners. While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not consider it legitimate income. This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority. It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out. The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more alert to heed any attempt to circumvent the rules. UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation. The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than €10m in 2015/16 with a turnover of €542.4m. The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published. PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandise and shirt sales. The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing. The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of football's best players go and tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP. "It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS in regards to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club. "It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday. "Once a country owns a club, anything is possible. It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can walk different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Nostalgia Takes a Niche in 'Wet Hot American Summer' and 'Comrade Detective' This re-run of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' glory days of the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things. As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories. But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out. "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, and not just for its absurd humor (it featured an original story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). By getting down to the heart of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of retrieving the last part of the joke. "Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and more watering-can in its parody, including a riff on '90s stalker movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. ("The hand that rocks the cradle"). At one point, a character is browsing through an Apple PowerBook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991". Many of the central stories are the same. The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity. And there's another insanely vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now backed by George HW Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black). As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise. It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's mustache from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy is now feeling like an old geezer. It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise, like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume to be his logical conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, the final scene of which will show the gang attending the film premiere of Wet Hot American Summer. Amazon's Comrade Detective, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of The Americans, the movie Atomic Blonde, and even GLOW, with its East vs. West wrestling iconography . The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas claims to be a found TV series: an eighties Romanian drama with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the Fighting the way of Marxism-Leninism. The lead roles - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with dialogue dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It's a brilliant idea. But it's not much more than an idea. There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV like Americans might watch football). And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice. But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - involving a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays as one. With six long episodes, it drags on and the comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough. Edited to a shorter length, "Comrade Detective" could do a better job of delivering its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always manned by two fat men devouring a pile of hamburgers. The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything fodder for a feast. The fictional Romanian creators weren't wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and theirs.
Bank of England to hold interest rates at 0.25% The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and moderating inflation dampened speculation of an increase. The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintained interest rates on family income amid mounting pressures. Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to hold interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members targeting a hike this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for a hike. In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn should. But she signaled that rate hikes would be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise more than expected in financial markets. Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit. She will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15bn more under that scheme - at £115bn. Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "In MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption." On interest rates, she reiterated that "some monetary tightening" would be needed to cool inflation and "a little more" magnitude than markets are expecting. Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020. However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited". The bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next compare to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May. It kept its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018. The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following the news. The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros. The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth numbers dampened rising expectations for a rate hike and Q2 GDP rose to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous three months. Growth is expected to come in at 0.3% in the third quarter, although according to the bank it will recover slightly towards the end of the year. The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and modest pay rises, as the tightening will first get worse before set to improve. She added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the collapse in incomes over the next few years, but added that wages will recover "significantly" by the end of their three-year forecast. The economy will also be boosted by rising demand for UK goods due to weak sterling, which will offset some of lower consumer spending. The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the pound to fall. The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy. Ahead of the bank's latest rate-rate ruling, calls for a rate hike had increased as inflation put pressure on hard-pressed budgets, with three policymakers calling for a hike to 0.5% in July. Inflation has eased to 2.6% over the past month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said that was expected and would pick up again in the coming months. The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound. Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers said: "With the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become more competitive as lenders are clamoring for deals and looking to end the year on a positive note. The market is looking particularly strong for those who are phasing out existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with no-fee options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people Patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle over NHS funding for the drug. NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study involving an estimated 10,000 people. He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that gave the NHS the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it. The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as an "important new intervention" by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "defining moment". Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to enroll, with more clinics to follow in October before rolling out across England in April 2018. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection. Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough medication in a person's body to prevent HIV infection. Such drugs can be taken as little as two hours before intercourse every day or so. Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, trans people, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated. Clinicians will identify eligible participants who will consent to the study, including males, females, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment. People living in England who are registered with a GP can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic. The scheme is worth £10million and NHS England signed a deal to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing. The study is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is being targeted, taken up and implemented at scale. Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV. It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest public health challenges." Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV. PrEP, when targeted to those in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to transform the UK HIV epidemic From September people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to partner negotiation, which will benefit many, many lives. We warmly welcome this announcement." Ian Green, Chief Executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be to ensure that the study is rapidly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind. Now that PrEP testing medicine is sourcing we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people living with HIV." Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "After months of delays and hesitant government implementation, the start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue. The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end transmission of this life-changing infection. This trial brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP. It is now important that this study is done across the country as soon as possible to protect individuals who are infected with HIV, and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Big Life: Mezzanine floors and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014. It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags. "Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne. "I was looking for something that was comparable to my price. I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings. I fell in love with it and made an offer that day." Since the initial viewing, the 1,000 square foot home has had a complete makeover. Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to make the most of the ample ceiling height. "I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light. That was my requirement," she says. To that end, she commissioned Notting Hill-based Erfan Azadi architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but a place to live for Joanne . The ceiling was not large enough to fit two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine to stand on. Erfan had to think creatively to solve the challenge. "The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains. "We had to arrange the rooms so that they stacked on top of each other without having to bend down. It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but laying out the steel so that it was the right height for function, at the top or bottom would have." This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two full-height rooms on top of each other—with plenty of added drama. For the mezzanine, a classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area. Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents, and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program. The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light. A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer. In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room. At the entrance, mirrored units accommodate all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses. Perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close off the kitchen when not in use. Collapsible kitchens are nothing new. The special thing about this is that it is a garage door. "A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "It's counterbalanced so when you slide the door up it slides very easily." Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16m², an extra bedroom and an improved layout. "At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space -- or how your property is valued," Erfan says. "In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and make a calculation based on floor size." Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge. "The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls. Those are important, but they don't play with your heart." It shows that good design and increased square footage can transform a home from something standard to something truly amazing. In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave this one.
Brothers battle over $500 million real estate empire Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers find themselves in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million. Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors down from his younger brother Paul. He took him to the Supreme Court to see how their property and business assets should be divided. Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a heated argument over the split erupts in the Supreme Court. Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties valued at more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood shop in 1973. It was there that the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores. It sold for $85 million in 1999. That money has been invested in real estate and the De Lutis portfolio now includes downtown offices, the developments of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping malls. By agreement with her late father, Colin—described by Paul as "the chief operator and the dominant figure" in the De Lutis family—owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third. A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million in property and Paul owns $176 million. Dividing real estate and cash has proven to be a pain point for Paul. "The partitions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best properties," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015. Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place. The brothers are also now fighting for control of the existing business - which Paul claims Colin locked him out of. Colin argues this is not true, instead accusing Paul of incompetently managing some possessions. In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute. "My Italian heritage dictates that family is the number one priority," he wrote. The cost is mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and involving leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides. Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970's. They used the security to purchase the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop. Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my senior years of high school, when Paul was just a little kid (about 10 years old)." Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons amicably. "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote. Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company. Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "have become embittered about the terms of their financial split." Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL board member and the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 bio by Eddie McGuire. Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys. Only Colin responded via text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts. "It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and have our family name through the courts," he wrote. In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands. "Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current argument," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution." On Friday, that hope seemed to be over. "Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence. Others have tried and failed. Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it. If so, he will be the first. Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information on President Trump -- including news media reports -- in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even tack. Here's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey: "When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day on the job, he laid out a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he hopes to fix: bad ones Information getting into the President's hands. Kelly told staff that information should flow about him -- whether on paper or in briefings -- because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information." Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet. President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong. "When candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from agencies that needed persuading," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February. Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure his personal media consumption includes steady praise." OK. But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous. Perhaps these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that without their intervention, Trump's tweets would have been even more explosive. We'll likely never know about the tweets Trump didn't send. If his co-workers have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have paid off. But nobody has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy. Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, the people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that might further their views of the world. Politico -- deep in the story -- reported in May on the advisers' penchant for providing the president with dubious information for strategic reasons. This was an example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher: "Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and become obsessed with finding out where they came from That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch to be of leaks" from being in the White House. Despite Johnson being permanently banned from Twitter for bullying or not offering concrete evidence or having made false allegations in the past and retracting them. Trump read the article and began, Questioning employees about Walsh." Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives." How did that work? Kelly tries to do the same three months later. Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisers still strive for influence. These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire Row' Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with some determined travelers who have negotiated a council dug ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions. The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street dubbed 'Millionaires Row'. They have brought horses, babies and an army of transports after being thrown out as recently as May, but have not been deterred by a ditch dug by the council to thwart their incursions. The tactful group found a breach in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a route. Angry residents have harried Solihull Council, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem". An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being redirected from Bentley Heath where they threw rocks at passers-by. The Council must be shamed into action as it has failed in dealing with the problem was useless. The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again. More arrived last night, probably more today." She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks. I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my council tax if council does so can't even stop." A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travelers only to be looted by another round. The numbers have increased this time and you even have a horse in Park area seen." A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized encampment in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as soon as possible. In order to collect our evidence it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101. This will help create a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case."
Italy sharpens tone on NGO migrant lifeboats Italy has warned NGOs operating lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules governing their operations. "If NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it's difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat belonging to the German aid organization Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively colluded with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration. The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio. "For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media. "We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation." The Italian authorities had been monitoring the 'Jugend Rettet' boat, the Iuventa, since October. It is suspected that its crew takes on board dinghy migrants delivered directly to them by traffickers and allows the smugglers to leave so the ships can be used again. At least one such clash allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's filing, the contents of which were released by Italian media. The crew are suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not any other motive. Most importantly, under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities. Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms. The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "substantial changes or hindrances" to their rescue operations. Among those refusing to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF). Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue efforts has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors have borne fruit. "In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister. He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries hoping to reach Europe.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for texting and calling her boyfriend encouraging suicide. Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and has been suspended for five years. Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014. Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken. My son was my best friend." Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal. She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness. Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood teary-eyed, hands clasped and eyes downcast as she was sentenced. "Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court. "She ended his life to make her own better. She took no responsibility," she said. "She has shown no remorse". But Carter's attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets." Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their "age or level of maturity or even mental illness had any significant impact on their actions". A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which said that "there's not a day that I don't go by when I'm not mourning the loss of my beloved son. I want him to be proud of me and how I'm handling everything. I'm trying , to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity," it says. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children. "Not having that one person that I've been with every day since birth is a pain that I will always carry with me for the rest of my life," she said. The case appears to set legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide. Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014. The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she encouraged him to end his life. "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . In the moments leading up to his suicide, she wrote, "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy." Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention from Roy's death and ordered that she take advantage of the case through any press. The case divided legal opinion. Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the 2007 murder of her British flatmate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago. Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face backlash A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles. The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles. Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions. Neither company described the ventures as a recall. European automobile manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations. But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma. The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem. The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called cut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but back off under normal driving conditions. Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic. Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi engine development was arrested in Germany. The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face a court in the United States. Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a German criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry centered on the United States was expanded. The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change. Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions. Eric Chaisse, expert from the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn . This affects the lifespan of lavender. There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits leafhoppers, and in very dry weather there are very many of them." And the stakes are high. Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfumes and cosmetics. Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either missing or weakened. So we have fewer essential oil parts." Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing cultivars that are more drought-resistant.
The killing of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico Staffers at the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on Sinaloa State's recent chaos of organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars. But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety. They have been told that it is important to change their routines. Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: bring their children, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, to the office or leave them at home. Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Enemies, Neutrals, Allies. They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough. There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on government or cartel payrolls, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous. There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists have joined the ranks: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states. Among the latter is its editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas. "The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence. His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his signature Panama hat. The workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporters discuss their common issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia. Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has only initiated two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists rarely bring the killers to justice. At Riodoce, they still insist on covering the violence of Sinaloa, heartbroken and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous. Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says. "It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "Until we know why, we distrust everyone." On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the offices of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan. He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was pulled over by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates to "Twelfth River". The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby. Valdez was 50 years old. He left a wife and two adult children. Rumors tend to fly loose in Culiacan. But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence. Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum. It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kingpins that are larger than many houses for the living. Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States. Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt of failing to protect his friend. He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder. First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons. This publication may have angered the Sons, with suspected gang members buying up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands. The second mistake was failing to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story. Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexico's violence against journalists. He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be around. He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 equity interests. In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without running into the drug problem," Bojorquez said. Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased. Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories no one else dared to cover. Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America. That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexico's drug history, wherever it led. He freely admitted that he was scared. "I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ awards. Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October. "You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or play the fool. I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths...why didn't you say what was going on? " The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could swear like a docker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive. They trusted his routine. He would always take his hat He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table there. Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing? His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about it how best to do their jobs and stay alive. "They don't like it when they move around with their wives, their kids, their clean shops, their clandestine runways," for drugs, employ . "These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said. The result, even at the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation. Trust your own instincts. If it smells wrong, stay away from it. The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened." The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials. The landscape is constantly changing. Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for safety training. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico. Outside, two police officers took shelter from the 104 degrees (40C) heat under the shade of a tree. They were hired by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan. Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy. It's been months since reporters went to the mountainous terrain where the drug gangs are under de facto control. For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories. There was the murder of the brother of former popular boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa. They also had a government spending exposé that focused on the governor's hometown. And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA's office. There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite haunt of drug dealers and authorities. A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of politics for most of the century. Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption. Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military ambush. Just months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the most informed source on the kidnapping. "We would have known what happened earlier," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim build. "Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." Valdez's office has been repurposed as a repository for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because staff have become what they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press. Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning to protest over another journalist. Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after Valdez was killed. A burned body was discovered and officials say it is his based on DNA testing. Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and structures in organized protests. On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case. In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth. She has since asked to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned her anger violated her objectivity. Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society. In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime. The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year. "In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said. Apparently the murders have a deterrent effect. No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas. Her body was found along with a note said to be signed by the Zetas Cartel: "Here I am for my reports." A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head. Some outlets have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the March assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach. Others are carrying on, as did Nuevo Laredo's El Manana after the assassination of their director in 2004. In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly targeted the drug cartels with a front-page editorial headlined "What do you want from us?" Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country. It's a painful decision. It's hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets, looking for danger. And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz. For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of risky decisions. Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits the drug trade terrifies him. "Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said. At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing. A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead. The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region. From the curb, they published the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone. The front page had to be changed the next day. Sirens wailed nearby - another gun battle in the area. Bojorquez glanced at the officers standing guard to see if they were on standby. If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it. Under the massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce staff followed in his footsteps. "How can you even consider closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to put her out on the street to report."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one. Now researchers have found that the first glimpses of a Canadian miner's incredible rhinoceros were so well preserved that experts have described it as the 'Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs'. It was so well preserved that they could even tell its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and they said it had something of a "troubled past". The report in Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the finest specimens of dinosaur in the world." The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago. Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers, who describe it as "truly remarkable." According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind. It was found by Shawn Funk when he was visiting on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada. He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look. The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) clod of earth. After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled. "If you blink your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display. "It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved specimens of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs." Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered in armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs. The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, also used by many modern animals. This would have allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it may have been threatened by larger dinosaurs. The 110-million-year-old creature of the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Researchers have now studied the wild animal, naming it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it. The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body. They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature's top was darker than its underside. Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of animals alive today. It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival. But most contemporary animals that employ countershading -- think deer, zebra, or armadillo -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle for survival. "Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said. Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown. Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate for its last meal. They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got caught in a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the sea floor. At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably much further inland than they are today. "This nodosaur is really remarkable because it's completely covered in preserved scaly skin, but it's also preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said. "The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous. You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you squint your eyes just a little, you could almost believe he was asleep is." The Cretaceous Period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth. Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors. These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster. The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank under the sea and became mummified in the mud after it died. The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011. According to the museum, it's the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to rump. The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg). It contained two 20-inch spikes protruding from his shoulders. Researchers believe the armored herbivore swept through western Canada until a flooded river swept it out to sea. But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail. The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of skin still cover bumpy armor plates along the length of the dinosaur. As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is 'as rare as winning the lottery. The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets. Petrified remains of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that support the animal's skull. His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards. I can count the scales on its sole'.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?" On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core. Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone. She stumbled across a post from someone in high school. "Police just killed an 18-year-old child and he's still lying on the street," it said. Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she shut down Facebook and opened up on Twitter. A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline. The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours. "That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself. But death was nothing new to her and her community. She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening. There were photos of police tape and people shouting and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!" She watched a live feed showing a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog. In another video, she said, another police officer cocked his gun and yelled, "I'm going to kill you... animals all." "It's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement. "This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and can call typical." At that moment I felt chills. I was angry and I cried." She booked a return flight and went home the next day. After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters on April 11. It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, of the strength and resilience that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets demanding answers as Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown the two share a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black condition." "You remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for where do you believe?" she recalled what she said. "We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right. I couldn't take them," Ferrell later said. "What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past. She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it. She needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization but also the different strata of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free, to free ourselves.Even though I'm fortunate enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she isn't unlike the next black woman kid. I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice by keeping her out of it." The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location across from the police department that became a camp area as activists awaited Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-charge. There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch. They prepared bags and helped pass them to protesters. A new kind of activism for Ferrell slowly began to take shape. "My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food equity and health inequalities in black communities. "I had no experience in organizing. It all came." Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors. Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what was happening. One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Are you going to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?" This skepticism was fueled by countless cases from people, often whites, in a community that thrived on their pain and resilience. As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates. His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team from "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting. "This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk," Davis said. "That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed." The goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience — to show that the movement is "not about a messianic leader, it's a community that's coming together," Folayan said — it proved to be the most open participant in the film. As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, falling in love and marrying her wife. "I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product. "But I understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." Additionally, Ferrell's story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement. Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay. "Black gay women leaders have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and so we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts. Black gay women have to bear the brunt of everything." Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being held up by black women and a lot of black women". However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film. "She was the person who shook up that energy," she said. "It's no coincidence, even though she was on the front lines because there is so much at stake living at these crossroads as a black gay woman. You can feel her energy through the screen." Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police linger. Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years for blocking a freeway at a demonstration. She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "A mess". Still, she clings to a chant, and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago. "It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love and support one another. We have nothing to lose - but our chains."
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA In the center of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, almost subtly alike - hanging from cables hanging from the ceiling. The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning. Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic leaks via the WikiLeaks website. The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance. It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computing and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he was just three days in his had office. Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has made a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also created for identity. Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been open about identifying as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft. Her image was suppressed by prison, so much so that there was only a single photo — a grainy, black-and-white selfie of Manning visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig — with which she was associated. In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had just come from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'. In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like. That's when she received an email from a newspaper magazine. "They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition. And she couldn't be visited at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait. The artist and her imprisoned muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years. They even created a Suppressed Images comic, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future where the President would commute Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to see the exhibit in person. That Obama would actually call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of fortunate coincidence. There's something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition, too, now that Donald Trump is waging a war against government whistleblowers and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid divisions he was meant to mend. continue to ignite. When asked about the odd timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason". In an artistic statement inscribed on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below it (the "i" in her family name is followed by a heart), called for an end to "the automatic fragmentation that has been based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. " On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil. Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we all are. "What I hope people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories , can also be seen. "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories." The final piece in the exhibition, kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above. It shows Manning emerging from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong, speakerphone in hand. "If they cold your speech, then they've won," they say. "So never shut up". "It came right out of a letter she wrote me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia. "I still get goosebumps talking about it." Manning has yet to see the exhibit in person - as was presciently anticipated in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra, moving like hordes rally of protesters. That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibit, right down to the height (5" 2, Manning's stature) at which their genetic haplogroups were written in pencil. "In the past I've had them on the wall, but I wanted that they feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits. "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Staffer Wanted for Manslaughter A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer wanted as suspects after a man was found dead in a luxury Chicago apartment injuries had been stabbed. Arrest warrants for murder were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court filings show. The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times. A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27. Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body. Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said. Lathem has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007. Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus. "This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said. Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University. A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and stand ready to assist US investigative authorities in any way we can." The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in. Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he urges the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities. "Police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects. Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008. The police described the scene as very gruesome. Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also happened on July 27. Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were inside the building. "We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said. The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be implemented. "At a certain stage of fulfilling the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping). The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday. The PM commented on the second part of WADA's Code Compliance Roadmap, which outlines the criteria for RUSADA's reinstatement, recently published on the organization's website. According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia. "Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented. And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported findings of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport. Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake. All measures have been implemented. But there were no government programs and we will not admit something that does not exist ." Mutko's words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission. Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted to past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. Nobody intends to repeat this one accept the report unconditionally," added Smirnov. In November 2015, RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping controls in Russia by WADA in the wake of the doping scandal. However, she has been allowed to schedule and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD). After visiting the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work. Responses were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, fraudulent. And even when she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process. "There was just never any consistency or objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed. She called outside people for help. A new breed of human resources startups is burgeoning to help companies find out how their employees are feeling. By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employee anonymity and grievance hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and go directly to the board of directors. "You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement. Errett said she gained better insight into what her employees are thinking and feeling over the three years with Glint. In addition to Snap polls and surveys by specific teams, it provides a Company Heat Map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down into why. Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture lest they become the next Uber embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment at where those who spoke were punished. For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity. The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments. Denver, Colorado start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge of interest and activity earlier this year amid the discredited Uber case. Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla. Uber recently signed up as a client. Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of your problem areas. It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behavior. And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go straight to the board of directors. "The court of public opinion has gripped the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and chief executive officer. If a company is found treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycotts, worker turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said. Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters. In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, make a formal complaint, and hope they took it seriously. It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there wasn't a good way to track employee grievances. Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in city or state offices—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be more quickly identified and addressed. "I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group. "And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." Businesses began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethics violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said. But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from getting online. "Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees for using their products. It's a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture capital investors who have backed both startups. Convercent received $10 million in February funding from companies including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing total capital to $47 million. Sparkles secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million. These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital. There's a growing body of research showing that today's workforce expects more from their jobs than they used to. In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes. Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission. "When people are happy to be at a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint. Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well. Businesses thrive when employees work hard and are engaged. When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you're finding support. Employee engagement data is important according to workplace culture experts. But the data is useless if a company's administrators don't take action. In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way. And when change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees. "If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection . "Because if you don't follow, employees will be like, 'Did you really hear me? Take care of that? And if you don't care, why should I? Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when an issue is reported through Glint, Errett said. And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was impressed by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, being able to reorganize several teams within the company and adding communication training to address the issues At Ruby Tuesday, the company continues to gain new insights about the employees and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to better employee retention in an industry known for high turnover."If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said. "And if you lose people, also lose customers. And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA Eliminates Two-Day Practices and Makes a Long Day for the Bruins It's getting close to 11 p.m. when a crowd of UCLA football players converse on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields. Some have removed their jersey tops, revealing backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp. For a good portion of the team, those idle minutes represent a lunch break. Players enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three-hour practice session for their final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning. "It's a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned Tuesday. The NCAA is eliminating two-day drills to lighten the players' burden, and it's actually lengthened its days -- at least until Friday's finals. Therefore, UCLA's first three practice sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already packed schedules. The compromise away from the two days is more than a day that saw the Bruins delay the start of camp nearly a week after last season and practice during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood. They are scheduled to hold 18 drills over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M in September. Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even as it adds another point to players' busy routes. "We put this enormous load on them for three or four days and it's very challenging," said Mora. "And they just pushed through, they keep pushing, they're great people. I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time it's going to be really great." UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which is given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already had footballs pelted clearing a safety net behind a goalpost , will not be an easy task. Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be an issue once those rooms become vacant during the season. "We will use our security," said Mora. "It's a real problem and it's not far-fetched to think that people would rent a room there and then get ready to tape an exercise there. If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal . But we have security there and we have security in parking lot 8. We'll do the best we can with what we have. I'm not too worried about that. We have a plan."
Facebook plans to step up fact-checking to fight fake news Facebook plans to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display the results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday. It's one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news. The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fact-checkers, who may display fact-checking results from the original article. Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election. The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being inundated with false stories ahead of May's presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail , to quickly eliminate hateful postings like before the elections there in September. On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany. "Beyond knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog. She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Making a Graphic Novel: A Castle in the History of England More recently, little Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s. But Scotney has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from his cozy perch in Kent's Bewl River valley and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents. "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully. "What a personal connection to hold this letter in my hand." 'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story is illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. It's not Rhodes' first book to be based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional. "I only reacted that way to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "That's his thumbprint! And letters always smell of smoke, because back then people lit a fire for the light. For someone living 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being there too. Oh, I love Archives!" For someone so wrapped up in paperwork that he's supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England, and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest I overstated my welcome a little"), this all seems like it to be too good to be true. Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian 'new' castle, perusing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat. He wandered the grounds and ruins of the old castle, speaking to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on his book's illustrations. Then, at night, he "drank whiskey and began to write". Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died. When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff were just beginning to tend to the archives, which he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the attic'. Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You'd think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought over. Boys, let things take their course!" Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. "There is a record of a riot occurring at the castle in 1380 in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes. "The Peasants' Revolt began in this area and I thought a riot was a good start. Maybe the two are connected?” Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation. Or 'The Smuggler' , which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery not made until years later when his coffin was dug up).The Darrells are Rhodes 'Favorite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite the crooks, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford. Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I picture them as a bunch of handsome lads with a knack for wooing heiresses." After his stint at the castle is over, Rhodes is on the Seeking Other Unique Writing Experiences He completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that nature has since reclaimed, but Scotney has special place for him." I was sad to leave," he says. It was like, "Oh, now I've got to deal with this damn life again."
Washington changes green card rules There will be a new US immigration plan to change green card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media. It envisages reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work permit visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas. The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the President. The bill will be discussed in both chambers of Congress. "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries." The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system. This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by American media.
The Rise of Sex Robots Is Real, and We Should Be Concerned Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier than this, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots arrives. Yes indeed. Sex robots are a big thing right now. Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years. According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously. Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape, and fingernail type. "People make fun of them, but companies are shipping a lot of them and we're going to see them a lot more," said Mr Sharkey on the release of his new report. Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that's warm to the touch - with deliberately human responses achieved through artificial intelligence. The user can also "customize" their robot according to their beliefs, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes, to the shape of its nipples, to the type or color of its fingernails. But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive. Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin. The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customize their robots to have traits they find appealing, such as shyness. And then there are the True Companion-developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality. "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc. She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people! She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in the mood!" There's a lot of troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they're replacing real human relationships - but the submissive feminine traits, the innuendos on rape, taking a step towards Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah is what worries you the most. On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men. "If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have roxxxy then?" reads the website. However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy. Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional extra Most men will Of course, they don't own sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being. But what is transpiring from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in. And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to be. There's some overlap, though, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there's a President in the White House who has boasted about sexually assaulting women. The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic imagery, the intertwined bodies and gouged eyes, but how realistic that vision appears. The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn't feel like a big leap. The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions). Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body. But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent actual women. They can't separate from their companion or just walk away. They have no mediation or backstory, nothing suggesting independence or anything to disturb the fantasy of total submission. In other words, they are obliging slaves. Or to put it in 2017 idiom: maids
Trump's great achievement? He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families. Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives. We are all supposedly making an effort to burst our filter bubbles. Less noticed has been Trump's power to bring families together. I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week. She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect. With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including Republican kin with whom she had fought over politics for decades, is suddenly and oddly on the same page. That's certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a broader context that it also entails considerable risks. The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right. When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the chilling possibility that one day we won't be repelled by his antics. There is an even more chilling long-term scenario, however, in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of sanity by his standards. I find myself gripped by an active nostalgia these days for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the lunatic - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which compared to Trump, in fact, as one very mild offenses occur. If Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee need only be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement. When my cousin was in town, we would take our kids to the Central Park Carousel, the largest of the New York Parks Department's carousels, and the best three dollars to spend in town if you don't need caffeine. The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns snarl and the animals twist to look over their shoulders in fear - supremely sinister, and the strumming music oddly conveys this. So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings grow old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream. Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not Swiss Cottage - Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub doesn't count - but a major roundabout in North London. The Central Park carousel is still an oddly magical experience, however, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can all ride it and have a great time. If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks but luckily no one asked for it. On the other hand, this week at a department store, I was forced to rate my transaction "experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe my credit card. The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to match the review with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter. Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed. The poor woman in the department store stood there grinning apologetically while I wearily had the experience of handing her my five star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain Pistorius has left prison for a second time for a hospital visit. He was hospitalized last year for treatment for cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities say he suffered after falling in his cell. Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction. He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting multiple times at her through a toilet stall door at his home in Pretoria. Pistorius claimed that he mistook his girlfriend for a late-night intruder hiding in the cabin. Prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient. The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year. Pistorius risks having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful. There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians detained for illegal camping in Greece Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by the TV. On the morning of August 1st, in Sithonia, the police arrested a group of people camping illegally, including the two Bulgarians. They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released. Greek authorities have tightened controls over free camping, and are imposing significant fines on anyone found staying in a place not meant for that purpose. Controls will continue throughout the season. The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Red Meat, Dairy, and Chocolate May Help Alleviate IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system. But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet high in meat-based proteins and dairy products could reduce symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness. While sufferers are typically advised to avoid meat and dairy products to help relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that protein's essential amino acid, tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut. The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to make sure harmful microbes hiding in food don't enter the body. Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues. When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result. Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their guts. And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells. Professor Colonna said: "We made a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet , the more of these immune cells they had". He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments when the same system is at work in humans. The postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not. She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract. The mice's intestines were DNA-sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells but absent in the mice without them. Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and didn't develop these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged. To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - minus the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice. The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells. When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid. When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half. dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts. It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease. She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut. Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night. Chelsea's £40m signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, their last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role alongside the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will. However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season. "He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho. "We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later." Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season. The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings but he insisted the club had already done a 'fantastic job' of fulfilling three of their four priority signings. "To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added. "I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they tried really hard."
British inventor microchips himself to get into home and car with a swipe A British inventor is the first in the country to be microchipped so he can open his front door, enter his office and even his car with a swipe can start. Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals looking to simplify their lives with technology through his company, BioTeq. He has met with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure was performed to medical standards. The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds. Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock. The married father-of-one has now installed technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting last month's American manufacturing is costing taxpayers, according to the military, giving TIME magazine up to $24,000. The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American construction programs. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states. The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi. The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter is responsible. "I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual, high-visibility event," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the naval deputy commander for aviation, on the eve of the event. The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn around 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening . The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty hour restrictions. The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft during the time on the ground. It was not clear from the recordings made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required. The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes. Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the regulation. "One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not," the commander wrote. "Sounds like you're closed off," replied the second-in-command. The Made in America event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act. But even official events have political overtones. At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of health care reform that was underway in the Senate and touted efforts to curb government regulations. The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon. Presidents are required to use them for travel. But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual. Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services amid his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is full of stories complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane. "The White House is excited about the Made In America show -- showcasing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said White House Assistant Press Secretary Lindsay Walters. HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to drop the US President at the White House with precise centimeter readings. When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings in the White House. The flight for the "Made in America" event counted toward the month's flight crew training needs, an official said. Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions." The White House said taxpayers didn't shoulder the burden for any of the other props unveiled at the event. A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn. HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the Presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event. However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour. Unit records list the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base at Quantico, Virginia. The White House argues that the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate. "Setting the cost to taxpayers based on reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said. "These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual appropriations." According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include labor costs, but do include fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs. At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event. "The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week," Spicer said. "And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it. And I think like most As Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military hardware that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create, and it's appropriate to highlight that." It wasn't clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he did get into the driver's seat of a fire engine. At the White House, speaking to Sikorsky officials, Trump joked with the media about his own fleet of company products. "I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."

Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday. Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run for provincial council elections. Three women are running for the Vice President role and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women. "The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday. Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women fully participate and are involved in all parts of the electoral process. Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5. The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with a shift from international combat operations to an advisory role. This year, for the first time, elections will see power peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next. Haysom said a strong role for women will enhance Afghanistan's democratic success. The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered voters out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
GMB concerns over investment at McVitie Glasgow factory A union is looking to reassure managers at biscuit maker McVitie about their long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow factory. GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of any investment at the Tollcross site. More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits, among other products. McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5million in recent years. He added that employees and union representatives "would be the first to know" if their jobs changed. In a letter to the company's store manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for production line upgrades is not being pursued". GMB Senior Organizer, Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we are unable to gain clarity from the General Site Manager as to the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members. Generations of families have worked here and the Labor force is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow, a key pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.Therefore, from a jobs, wages and wealth perspective, and in the context of Brexit, the rising cost of living and a chronic decline in production, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie". A Pladis spokeswoman said: "The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the ongoing commitment from staff and union representatives. We had a regular meeting with staff two months ago and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.We discussed with the staff that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we continually review our businesses - and this applies to all of our businesses and sites - to remain competitive. She added: "Over the last few years we have invested in excess of £5million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements. We fully recognize Tollcross' heritage as a manufacturing facility. Should our operations at the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago? The La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti Paris Saint-Germain won't back down in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189m bid to trigger his release clause, but they told Barcelona three years ago World record heist warned? The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89million last season. Upon termination, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG are offering wages in excess of £500,000 a week. Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalans board insists the club have always done their best to establish themselves since arriving from Santos in 2013 to take care of him. But was the footballing world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago? When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players. "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said. "We respect all clubs, but if they try to sign one of our players there will be consequences." Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer. PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona were able to feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
