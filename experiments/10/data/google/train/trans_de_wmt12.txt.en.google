Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level Sensitive and magnanimous, Peter Englund's new book, Beauty and Horror. Here's a tip on how to do it: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark. You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel-like narrative. And these principals will act as your GPS, your beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and bereft of your illusions. Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature. He has written an unusual book, which he not aptly describes as "a work of anti-history". It contains only a few big names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment. It's less a book about what happened, he explains, and more "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods". "Beauty and Horror" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers. Some of these people become heroes. Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane, or die. Each of these lives flares up like votive candles in a church, some coming in while others go out. Englund's book deviates from the usual history books. It also corrects the notion that World War I was just the devastating trench warfare on the western front. "Beauty and Horror" wanders over other theaters of war with an expert's eye: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa. Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insurmountable problem. This is a moving book almost from the start. The war swamps the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordite. Imagine you are a woman at home with her children and hear cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you flee? Who is coming anyway? Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all. "Missing facts," notes Englund, "have been bolstered with hunches, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumours." "Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German seaman. Their stories were mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published material. Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are intensely vivid in Englund's lost-detail collection of small moments. Many of them are about lack and making do. In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Replacement, replacement everywhere." "Substitute coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons." He tells more about substitute food in Germany. He describes "meat made from pressed rice and fried in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes soled with wood." There were, he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes." Some stories are about honor and bravery. One American, recognizing his own thirst for savagery, says of the war: "One feels that, after all, this is what men were meant for rather than sitting in an armchair with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and to pretend that such a facade signifies civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one's starched and studded shirt-front." Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and that no one will notice or care. "When you step away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think it's happening in front of an audience," he writes. Instead, it's as horrific as "a condemned man hanged in secret." Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new forms of terror. "The conflict increasingly became an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories." He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the early century's bestiary": "the eloquent and ideologically staunch mass murderer in a tailored suit who butchers while seated behind a desk." People behave in unforeseen ways, and there is frivolous behavior as well as heroism. Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract an STD from a prostitute to escape front-line duty. "The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, for soldiers bought and smeared it on their genitals in hopes of getting into the hospital," he writes. "Those who were truly distressed would rub it in their eyes, resulting in them being blind for the rest of their lives." In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unassuming, adapting perfectly to his human task. In dozens of small scenes, he captures how the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred." People are beginning to wonder why their leaders make them fight. The best books on WWI tended to be more biased, like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, than lengthy history books. Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame. His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read about in non-fiction. I don't give it away anymore. But it's as if he had snatched that page with the main characters from under our noses in his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault involving hundreds of police officers, some wearing riot helmets. The decision was made for the night from Monday to Tuesday because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at this time. The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially thought they were taking part in an exercise. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges. The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to be repeated. And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training. Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities. A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island. Officials ramped up so-called chaos training -- counterterrorism measures that include rapidly moving large numbers of police officers -- to focus on lower Manhattan. The final training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River. The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which made it an "exercise" declaration. "The few police officers who were involved, as far as I know, didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who asked to remain anonymous. "The only ones who knew that Zuccotti Park was at stake were the senior officials at the department." One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned. Officials tried to clear the park on October 14, but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans. Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city -- hundreds of mobile officers typically deployed in high-crime neighborhoods. Mr Kelly said there are many people in and out of the park throughout the day, almost like commuters, so 1am at night is a good time to go in. "It was appropriate to do this when there were the fewest number of people in the park," he said. Ambulances with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were waiting in front of the exit at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge. The lights and the pre-recorded messages blaring from the speakers seemed to intimidate many of the protesters. When public officials in their light blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply gathered up their belongings and left. Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up their belongings. Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary. Reporters were forced to leave the park. Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Commissioner of Police, said it was for their own safety. But many journalists claim they were prevented from observing police action in the park. And they said the officers were very rough. Mr Browne said television vans could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park. As police made their way west through the mess of protesters' belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, they were followed by city sanitation workers who picked up what had been left behind. Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this soon appeared on the Internet. A main core of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park. Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests. About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp tied their arms together. And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said. Civil Protection officers were called to cut them free. As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 am. According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes. Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested at the park. Most of the arrests, he said, were based on "improper conduct and resisting arrest." The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department chief, the highest uniformed officer in the department. Phil T. Pulaski, detective's division chief, was also there. Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "did not direct the operation", as Mr Browne said. A second group of officers waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they did. Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south. From these locations, police could be seen expanding their perimeter around Zuccotti Park. At one location, several officers, many with riot shields, were seen herding people outside. About 28 people were in the northern perimeter. Some of the night's most violent action took place in the south of the park. At around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters deflated the tire of a police bus. At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood. In the end, an officer and a protester were taken to the hospital.
Caregivers' union to file lawsuit against city over layoffs The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday over the layoffs over their improper influence on the schools teach poor students are unnecessary and discriminatory. The lawsuit is likely the last resort open to the union, District 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs. Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators, and other workers who were among the city's lowest-paid employees lost their jobs on Oct. 7 in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for the city's banning of access to the past year a health fund maintained by the working groups to fill the budget gap. These allegations were categorically denied by the authorities. At a city council hearing last month, school director Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June. A member of the city council fired back, explaining that nothing in the budget specified school aid workers would be fired. City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education against a lawsuit. There will be a press conference on Wednesday formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit in the Supreme Court in Manhattan. The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are Black or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who lost their jobs. Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city does not have the lawsuit and cannot comment on its individual allegations. According to a draft lawsuit obtained by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's slums to support an unequal treatment lawsuit. She claims that poor schools have lost more volunteers because they are chronically underfunded. She states that while there have been no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants have lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in of the South Bronx were released. Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to help accommodate budget cuts." P.S. District 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment. The union also complained that high school principals were misled by the language in a memo authorizing the firing of care coordinators. The memo used the word "excess" to describe the plot, although in the US "excess" commonly describes a teacher's transfer from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers managed by the central office get paid. "Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred," the draft lawsuit says.
Mission complete, Congress ready to agree on Libya It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington ready to agree on the Libyan uprising. All it took was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and an end to American interference. On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee will pass a resolution co-chaired by Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), crediting Libya for the successful rebellion and US American troops for their "courage". "This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have started to rebuild their country," Kerry said. "It is a confirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts." The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate. This summer lawmakers from both parties and the White House squabbled over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the US military's role in NATO's Libya mission. In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the restricted use of US military forces in Libya. The bill was defeated in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote. But on the same day, this bill fell through in the Senate. The chamber also overruled a decision to cut funding for US operations in Libya. This left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory, with a Congress angry enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission but not angry enough to finally pull the rug out from under him. Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by events. Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20. The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st. Now the Senate may be ready to act. The International Relations Committee's resolution "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who are conducting military operations to protect the people of Libya support, for their exceptional courage and professionalism." The resolution also reaffirms "the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible Libyan transition to democracy." Will the new measures get the full backing of the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they divide lawmakers like the June law did? The final version met with opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican. Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law. According to the Capitol, it's up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every Republican and some Democratic congressional term. The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area currently coming to a Senate or Congress vote. Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get their amendments put to the vote, though they have tried often enough. Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress, covering a wide range of issues. Some are duplicates - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly. There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending." Some of the statutes are identical, too, but they give their employers -- especially novice Republicans looking to brush up on their resumes -- the opportunity to brag that they "wrote" such a policy. The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance. In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change. Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of regulations members of Congress can introduce, while Republican Jose E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the two-term presidential limit. Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to a good education and health care. An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a recurring template, as is an amendment banning flag burning. Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them. As eager as the members are to propose changes, they are moving much faster than in previous years. In the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress, 66. The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members routinely proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library. But they weren't much more successful than today's either. The last amendment to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point blank range during a campaign rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone on the Broadway play The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow and said the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress. When she appeared on ABC News' 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, she struggled for words and needed help walking. The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and traversed her head from front to back. Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake. In her first television interview after January's assassination, which killed six and wounded 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult". When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford (41) replied, "Pretty good." The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, taped shortly before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope." The special follows Gifford's recovery since the Jan. 8 assassination. In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she can be seen in the hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead. She can only lift a finger or two when encouraged by her husband. Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements. A nod of the head. A twitch of the lips. And then, her first words: "What." After a few days, Giffords whispered another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed. Videos playing on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" sings. Interviewed by Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she doesn't remember the day of the assassination. Her husband said he was reading a newspaper article about the assassination to Giffords on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the assassination. Shooter suspect Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri jail on compulsory medical treatment while awaiting trial. "A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer. "Hard, hard, hard." During his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I got hit." "So I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated'?" Kelly said. You just got hit. And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss. On cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines rallied around him. The crowd in black tuxedos stood and applauded. "The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser. A senior military officer at the gala, watched by Chief of Staff and then-Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the troops' role differently. "They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email. I'm sure the organizers meant well. I know that. But it wasn't respect, really. It was pity. The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public. The troops are heaped with praise for their sacrifices. But the praise comes at a price, service members say. The public is increasingly behaving as if it feels sorry for the people in uniform. "We weren't victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. "But apparently the only way to get support is to frame us as unfortunate souls." The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve. They also realized that the anger meted out to returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse. As a result, talks of pity take place quietly and privately between war veterans. After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside of the military world might view their service from two different perspectives. Some would regard them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and traveled to exotic locations. Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran lurks beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior state post in Washington. During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers were subtly asking if he would be able to withstand the pressures of a demanding post in Washington soon after returning from combat. "When you talk about your ministry, you have to counter the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons. The military's lack of ease stems in part from Americans' lack of interest in the war. Battlefield performance is rarely singled out for praise by a country with little military experience and little benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way that we absolutely did in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Instead, much of the praise from politicians and the public focuses on the suffering of a member of staff. Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces mounting pressure to crack down on rape This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will face charges of failing to intervene in a rape court-martial. If that doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing. Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier. It was October 2008 and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beers. He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink. "My alarm bells went off," Lyman said. But the Texan brushed her concerns aside. I was like, "Oh no, he's 19. He's from Texas," she said. "I wish I had listened to my gut feeling." Minutes after they walked into Lyman's room, the man came up behind her, held her down and, she alleges, raped her. This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees anxiously await a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they are bringing against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court. The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread rape within the military and in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights. In February, by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney When filed, the lawsuit initially had 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 over the following months: 25 women and three men, all alleging that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers and that the military failed to investigate convict or provide appropriate justice following the alleged attacks. Burke says she is pursuing top military leadership because that's where the problem starts. "The military is hierarchical," she says. "Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership." Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits. Their strategy: instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will file many more lawsuits if necessary to keep the pressure on. The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by US Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Court filings obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy, first and foremost that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces. Under a 1950 Supreme Court law known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers. "The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," says the document. The Department of Defense has declined to comment on this story. Things have changed since the 1950s. If women are still not authorized to serve in combat, the only distinction is in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, particularly in connecting with local women in war zones. The result: 150 female soldiers died between these two wars, two-thirds of them in combat. It's time the military modernized, says Burke. And she's not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending. At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynist atmosphere. Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnosis given to rape victims in order to remove them from the service -- a common practice, according to activists like the service's Anu Bhagwati Women's Action Network, a human rights group. Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, alleging discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for people who say they have been sexually abused on the job. Nine bills were independently introduced to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, offering a number of leads. In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuse reports were reported by the Defense Department's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. But most abuses go unreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimate, that figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year. The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military went to court, half the rate in civil law. The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of traumas. In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the raid. That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a slew of police officers, doctors and commanders. She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found on her bed. Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During that hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend prior to the assault. Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted. "I still remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman. "I thought I was going to go into labor. I ran out of the courtroom screaming." "They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out I said to my commander: That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure." Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed her with a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty. In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged without receiving any support. Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed will go ahead is pure speculation, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School. Still, he notes, "I think they should move forward." What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned. I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine. The military is a decade behind because they don't have the same incentive and deterrent that liability brings. He adds: "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try." These things will only change if good people are willing to fight. If the hearing doesn't follow her path, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases. "We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made," she says. Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook Before he became the new face of far-right Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinion online. On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to being involved in a shooting spree in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public court hearing. Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of the time leading up to his attack in front of his computer chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting far-right groups on social networking sites. After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. But how do you find them? It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook. "We found that it wasn't difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe. Facebook's stash of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographics with scientific rigor -- just as marketers have been doing for years. Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but rather than linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to take a poll asking about their educational level, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future. Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave their office. "It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett. Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resentful of immigration. But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sane, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens." DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists. Think tanks, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, as seen in "likes," text messages, and status updates. With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with this site's name in the title increase by nearly 800% over the past five years. For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that through this site you can study people you wouldn't normally reach with your clipboard on the street. "In the past, if you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them." "They had to inform the party first and they would never have let them in," says Bartlett. "Facebook doesn't do all that - you go straight to them." Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems. A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problem drinking than students who remained silent about the issue. Moreno suggests that peer students, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates. "You can't solve a problem if you don't recognize it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post. "We found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise." Facebook is also constantly tapping into data from its own population. The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data only Facebook has access to - digital freedom champions have long known that the site gives its should make this vast trove of data available for others to research.) But Facebook users know the site is watching them, whether they like it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to reveal your personal information. But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about? While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything goes online. "I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of Studied students on Facebook. "As for her, it was all about her and her friends." Then there is the issue of methodology. Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is being completely honest. On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of the information in a user's profile and post is true. "What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn. So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use. "There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says. "Social research needs to look at the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline."
'Cold and Inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two rampages that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has himself in his first appearance described in a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter. "I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway," he told a courtroom of more than 500 people. "I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism." "I accept the laws, but I do not plead guilty." Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views." For the same reason, he refused permission for Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address his victims' families at the end of the hearing. Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks with four weeks off media access. He said authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks. About 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing. Some came hoping to catch a glimpse of Breivik, others wanted reassurance that he remains under lock and key. Everyone participated with the aim that everything boils down to a lock away. "I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. "It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect." Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing. He locked eyes with journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building. Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence he had any accomplices. It may please some that the July 22 attacks appeared to be the work of a single extremist rather than a group of radicals. But does that automatically ease the heartache and confusion an entire nation still feels? "I wish he looked like a monster but he doesn't," said a relative of one victim. "It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Late Steve Jobs Shown at a Theater This Week After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, citing the technological genius as a great modern inventor. But perhaps what Apple fans will find most telling in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week ahead of special screenings in major markets, is how well this creative mind understood business processes and workflows. He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who avidly tinkered with diagrams—a man who believed many business leaders suffered from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great one Idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product." In 1995, Bob Cringely created the TV series "Triumph of the Geeks" about the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour during which they had one of those rare in-depth conversations. At this point, more than 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already hard at work on his new computer company, NeXT, looking forward to widespread adoption of the Internet. While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in Fachidiot, he says the interview master copies were missing when it was delivered. It wasn't until after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage. This slightly remastered footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which hits Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday. For someone who has a reputation for abhorring lengthy interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies. And incredibly thoughtful. During the course of the interview, there are four lengthy pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of contemplation, during which Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts and striving for accuracy. There are also moments when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the fore, when he seems to react impatiently to Cringely's questions and nudges him to move more quickly on issues or subplots of greater importance. Recorded before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, the Lost Interview seems somehow eerily prescient as Jobs assesses what he thinks other companies are doing right and wrong and sets out his own vision of the future of computing. It's one thing to read posthumous tributes to Jobs' career. But seeing Jobs here as the aspiring dreamer on the verge of greatness is something very different, original and inspiring. He has a vision of how things could and should be. Shortly after he did all this, he went out and did it. A quick look at seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview: How he learned to run a business: "Throughout my years in business, I always ask, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is: "Oh, that's just the way it's done. Nobody knows why they're doing what they're doing. Nobody in the business really thinks things through. That's what I've noticed. Jobs is continuing his efforts to streamline Apple's accounts. Amazed at how costs were recorded - most often starting with "standard costs" which were calculated on mere guesswork and then adjusted with "variance" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the cost of doing business could be pinpointed down to the last detail How the Pope was teased: Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device used to sneak into the phone company and long distance calls all the more nst could lead. Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm as he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious. He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible. "We sent stuff around the world half a dozen times and if you yelled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," Jobs says with a chuckle. "We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world." Both of us, we didn't know much, but being able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think Apple would exist without it. Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank he and Wozniak almost pulled when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to speak to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could. With several members of the Catholic hierarchy summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst out laughing before the Pope himself got on the phone. How he fell in love with technology (and, unprepared, called Bill Hewlett): At age 12, while looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him. Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs landed a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer. "It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees." Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made". It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braun tube, and I fell in love with it. I would climb up HP as a teenager and be attached to this machine and write programs for it. How to improve innovation: Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products. Early in his career, when he was installing some circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble the whole computer. Working with a payment deadline of just 30 days, he had to think through both assembly and delivery of the finished equipment. Later at Apple, he recalled the problems he faced developing a computer mouse: "I remember making powerful arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300 would cost] and I got up and went out and found a manufacturer." Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly believable. On Big Companies Failing: Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their vision and lost control of their stocks. "Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?" They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful. Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's people like that] who ultimately run the company and the product that push people out of the decision-making process. The product genius that led to this monopoly is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary. That's what happened at Xerox... Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry. It could have been ten times bigger if it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s... They caught defeat from victory. On innovation as an art form: "There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... as you develop that great idea, it changes and grows." You learn a lot about its subtleties. You have to do attunements, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. You have to memorize 5000 things, these concepts, and put them all together... Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying, digging into the best stuff that humans have made, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do. Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. We are always shameless in stealing great ideas. Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. If it wasn't for computers, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law opponents as court takes case On the day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of his Judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case will be heard in court. The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to consider the petitions for consideration. One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reforms passed by Congress last year, legislation that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the US. The judges approved the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour groundbreaking debate is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced. The attorney who will stand in court and claim that the law should be overturned will likely be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the George W. Bush administration. Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles. Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade bodies, the National Federation of Independent Business, challenging the law. Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the process. The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court considered the case. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate Republican faction and a declared opponent of health care reform, was on duty, among others. The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federal Society events for years. And that doesn't violate moral rules. Indeed, judges break free from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower-level federal judges. If they were, they would arguably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers organized by law enforcement and other organizations provided that the judge is not a speaker, guest of honor, or a guest according to the program at such events." Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas' extreme closeness to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm morale and government activists. "This startling breach of morality and dissent from the code belies claims by some judges that the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a US civil rights movement. "The judges won and dined during a fundraiser with attorneys with pending cases in court." Your appearance and support for a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable. Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they too easily confuse court affairs with agenda-led groups such as the Federalist Society. And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist. Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first instance of legal challenges went to court. Her detractors urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case on bias, saying she was too engaged in defending the law to be impartial. Kagan makes no move to do so.
Boeing Lands Record $18 Trillion Order Emirates airline orders 50 two-aisle Boeing 777s with an option for 20 more aircraft. Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than $1 trillion. It's really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products. But it's big business when the company is airplane maker Boeing Co. and the combined list price for those 50 planes is a record $18 trillion. Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders. In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 planes, worth $450 trillion, over the next 20 years. Boeing announced its largest-ever commercial aircraft order by order value over the weekend: 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle jets. The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai. The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show, taking the total list price to $26 trillion. According to Boeing, Oman Air then ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort enormously on Monday. The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion. "This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market specialist. "The quality of these special customers is very high." Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries. So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which typically hurts airlines because it's one of their biggest expense items, isn't as damaging since the country benefits from higher oil prices. That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone plane orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said. "They have a natural hedge," he said. The Emirates order reaffirms Boeing's leadership in the widebody market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking supremacy with the A350. Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would delay launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. Delayed launch to gain more confidence after customers demanded higher payload and range. Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seemingly loses Michoacan election Luisa Maria Calderon claims drug dealers backed PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in gubernatorial race. President Felipe Calderon's sister has apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election. She claimed Monday drug dealers tipped the race in favor of one of her opponents. According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, has won the governorship race in the western state. "The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacan but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election. "They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... They manned polling booths, set up roadblocks... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]." The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000. But they are looking to return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort. The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. Vallejo appears to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had been leading in the pre-election polls. Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner. Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), who is currently incumbent governor, came third, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election. Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results. Vallejo, a former mayor of the Morelia capital, has denied links to drug dealers and is urging the other candidates to accept the results. Michoacan has long been ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines. It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006. The violence is still ongoing. A PAN mayor was killed during a campaign rally for Luisa Maria Calderon a week before the election and scores of candidates have pulled out of local elections out of fear. For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the Michoacan elections seem. The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this win makes us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help bail out Eurozone The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help bail out the Eurozone amid its deep debt crisis to prevent a long-term downturn that will hamper Asia's economic growth will brake. Rajat Nag, executive director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest growing economies must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements. He warned of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries "dispassionate" about the troubles in Europe, saying that Asia's financial backing of European leaders and resources could lead to a long-term collapse of the global economy helps to prevent. "We're all in the same boat." "So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. "Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune." "So if China and India can help, then by all means." In the past few months, Europe's currency union has fallen into a serious debt crisis. In the past few days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and both Italy's and Greece's prime ministers have resigned. The looming deep debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could slide into recession and prompting calls for leading emerging economies to band together to support the eurozone. Mr Nag predicted any support to Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said reciprocal deals - such as buying EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer European partners in Asia greater bargaining power. Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone as its economy is now suffering from falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital flows. "No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said. "We face great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth." "It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?" Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help wealthy Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges. Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at US-based Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell Aid to Europe to India's 1.2 trillion people, more than 800 million of whom are on $2 or less a day Life. "Eventually they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the beach for vacations. Then you have a problem," he said. Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's numerous and well-paid public sector employees with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways. Mr Nag said the crises in the euro zone will have "significant knock-on effects" across Asia. The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/is now threatened with "the risk of downgrading" due to the impending danger from Europe. He said vulnerable emerging markets need to have "contingency plans" in place to protect themselves in the event of a downturn and a significant outflow of capital from their communities.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. In doing so, he set off a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the Afghan theaters of war and the civilian assembly lines. The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears another cut of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress fails to reach a spending deal. "The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. He said a failure by Congress to get a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts and a halt to numerous new projects. "Such a large cut, done in such a thoughtless manner, would render most of our ship and building projects unfeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators. "We would also be forced to involuntarily part ways with much of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to reach the target." "These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness." The cuts would ultimately hit combat troops," Panetta said. "While wartime anti-terrorist contingents will not be directly affected by the seizure, the severe intrusion into the base budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned. "Staff hiring would be cut, leading to delays in hiring and hiring supervision that support the war." "Staff salaries would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime merchants, and legal as well as political support would be disrupted." The two senators replied to Panetta before 10 Days, asking for more details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense "The consequences of a Department of Defense seizure would herald a rapid decline for the United States as the world's leading military power." "We are vehemently g Against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter. "This is a result we cannot live with and certainly not one to be forced upon us." "The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to occur." Whether Panetta's letter and the senators' new warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or fuel calls for the Pentagon to be exempted from cuts remains to be seen. Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he has many years of budgetary experience in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon and knows he faces tough decisions. At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with shell but no core. "It is a ship without sailors." "It's a brigade with no ammunition." "It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots." "It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon. "It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to contend with potential adversaries." "She actually makes you angry." In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, seriously curtailing our global responsiveness and capability, resulting in unacceptable risk in future wartime operations ." And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are in the early planning stages. Also included in that list are the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a proposed new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee. Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step in upgrading, avoiding potential threats from China and other adversaries can be banned.
How to spot a lie A look at the current headlines shows how precarious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life. Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with allegations of sexual harassment from several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying. Penn State officials have been charged with perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys. Last week, over an open microphone, French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. Lies destroy careers and shake countries. New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself circulating denials that were quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence. Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair. And then, of course, no one who lived to see it forgets the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office. Stories of cheating at school and on college exams are common. There have been instances where teachers have provided their students with exam answers so that they can do well on their own assessments. Mentors who should be teaching the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay. How much deception do we experience? Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day. Many of these lies are considered white lies. Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. Detecting lies, or "detecting lies," is a skill that is important for everyone to learn, for both personal and professional reasons. A far cry from a parlor game such as charades, in which the goal is "Have you!" to shout, deception detection is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities conducting wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked. Lies look you in the eye. They don't always stutter, stammer, blush, or fidget. However, one should not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmask. A skilled lie-detector can break through to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, questioning, and timing. I have spent several years researching the scientific evidence in the vast and ever-expanding field of exposure. And it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when one's job responsibilities involve hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing . Good liars are very good at gauging other people, getting their interest, and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others. Thanks to research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell "self-oriented" lies more often than women, whose lies are more "other-oriented"—usually to protect others' feelings—that married People lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies"). We also know that when a person is exposed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty about lying to that person. How do you know if someone is lying? First, by observing that person's normal behavior. This is called "baselining", the starting position. It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes. Observe the posture, the laughter, the quality of the voice of your subject. They'd better know when someone usually taps their feet all the time so they don't unfairly blame them for tapping their feet during a meeting. Then look out for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behavior. Think of these clusters as alarm bells ringing, not evidence of exposure. People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet are pointing toward the door, or they are leaning toward the exit, changing their position in a significant way, or exhibiting a "post-interview relaxation," that deep, relaxing exhale and shift in posture when all the tough questions are over. Questioners often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-interview relaxation. Also pay attention to the language of your test subject. Scott Peterson's slip is famous when he used the past tense when claiming his slain wife was still alive, sparking a national search for her. Deceptive people may also use distancing language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeating a tricky question in its entirety. The most common verbal signs are subtle. Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge." This makes the response perceptual rather than factual, which often sets off alarm bells. There is no magic cure for detecting lies, but you can learn skills that will allow detection. With these skills, everyone can be less likely to fall victim to scammers, both in their personal and professional lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan revised after threat from delayed US approval Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering unions while reassuring environmentalists the company building the pipeline is trying to reschedule the project in order to get back to normal. TransCanada said Monday night it will divert the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska. The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska State House. TransCanada's Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different trajectory. This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would defer a decision on federal approval for the project pending the review of the new potential path, which includes the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, avoid. "This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News. The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision. Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department responsibility and pledged his support. The 1700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas. To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states. Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, estimating the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs. But Nebraska lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing the legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. The State Department's recent environmental impact study found that the project would have little environmental impact, but the energy industry source says the department's chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues . One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's advisor in 2008, has a conflict of interest. The other is whether a company hired to conduct the original study was an improper choice given its affiliation with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged for allegedly forcing toddler to vomit out of fear A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle threw a tantrum in the lobby of their Manhattan building, leaving their infant daughter so terrified that she threw up from fear. The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade so scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered from "personality changes, trouble sleeping" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in Manhattan Supreme Court. It was November 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to leave for a family day out. While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk walked into the lobby of her building on Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve in her arms. Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment. "Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to pick her up again," she said. LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman. "She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said. "I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'" She got angry and caught started ranting - she used the F word and the A word and got very loud... She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water from the bottle at me She said Genevieve had gone hysterical "I said to this woman: 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother. LaBelle lunged at the mother, still carrying Genevieve, and had to be restrained by her escort and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said. The baby cried so hard he vomited, she said. The LaBelle family later wrote to ask for an apology, but received no response. LaBelle's attorney and representative did not return calls seeking comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family attorney Sam Davis said he is not charging a fee and the family plans to donate any money they receive to Children's Cancer Aid. "We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said. "This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown towards a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby."
