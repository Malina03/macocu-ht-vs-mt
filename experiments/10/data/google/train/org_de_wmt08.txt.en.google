Small Saarland, good education The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities. Only in one field of education does the Saarland suffer from the same deficit as the rest of the country. "Yesterday I explained to a non-Saarlander for the 50th time that we are not French" - this is the self-ironic slogan of the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday. France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW). The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries. The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948. To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree. The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent. But Saarland also sends an above-average number of children to universities - many of them without a high school diploma. "In Saarland, people use the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW. More than one in five young people acquire their university entrance qualification at a vocational school, which puts Saarland more than seven percentage points above the national average. The options for combining professional and academic training are also comparatively well developed. In relation to the population, dual study programs are the second best in Germany. Despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years. That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects. "After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at general schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education. The government introduced nationwide comparative tests. So that the children can start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying. Only future comparative studies will show whether the performance of the students will improve in the long term. At Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent. Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states. Bayern calculate better. And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score points in this area. Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world. On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez had the clocks turned back half an hour in the South American country. Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke. According to a new law, Venezuela's official gazette will set clocks to world time minus four and a half hours. This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world. Chávez, who is hostile to the United States, justified his decision with the fact that the United States had imposed the division of time zones on the hour on the hour. In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia would be severed due to a hostage affair. The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government. "I can't do that because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil-producing country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday. With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country. The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to hold talks with Marxist rebels in Colombia over the release of hostages. Uribe "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday. Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain. A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet. He was spoken to by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the left-wing populist's constant heckling at the most recent Ibero-American summit and scolded him.
Germans face a drop in wages in 2007 Despite the strong economy, according to a forecast, German workers are threatened with a drop in real wages this year. Experts gave a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast. According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could expect less in real terms on their salary accounts than in the previous year. "This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price hikes in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper. Unemployment insurance could also place new burdens on employees. Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable given the current situation. However, the SPD politician was quoted as saying that the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again by having to ask the federal government for loans or grants. On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion for food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years. Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is Earth's infernal twin Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the poles, which also occurs on Earth in winter. For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected lightning on Venus. Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots from cloud to cloud at a height of around 56 kilometers, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature". According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning gave rise to life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life. Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees. "Venus may be Earth's devil twin, but she is a twin," Russel said. The basic question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size, has developed in such a completely different way. The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since there had been no probe dedicated to exploring this planet since the early 1990s. According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system. "They also show that our neighboring planet has more in common with Earth than initially assumed," says ESA. In addition to the well-known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that rotates much faster. The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica. The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days. However, it revolves around itself much more slowly: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days. Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions. Water accumulated on both, which remained in oceans on Earth but was lost to space on Venus. And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery. He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September meeting. Federal President Horst Koehler is worried about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama. "We shouldn't present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Koehler told Handelsblatt. At the same time, Koehler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September. "Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the differences in cultures," said Köhler. Everyone knows that Germany has to maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, emphasized the Federal President, but defended Merkel against the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy. "The chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy. China knows that too," said Köhler. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly indicated displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from within the Union. Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the "window policy" of the Union in foreign policy. After the Dalai Lama was received in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in German-Chinese relations. The Chinese leadership has not only uninvited German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL information. China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake. China opposes European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in an official capacity, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position. The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to secede Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which includes other modern-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France. Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior. Barricades burned, rioters shot the police with shotguns: After the serious youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany. "We have to make sure that social explosives don't build up and explode in violence here too. We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hanover. Not every young person can cope with the rapid changes in social reality. The federal, state and local governments are already working hard to eliminate problems, said Schäuble. This does not only apply to the integration of migrants. "From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing the first signs of success." However, it is too early to give the all-clear. At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same urban planning and sociological problems as in France. In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought serious street battles with the police in the past few nights. Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse. The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the federal government. In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects". The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France. However, there is still a need for action. Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under the age of 25 was "above average". Above all, more training places must be provided. Kolat emphasized: "We have to give the young people a perspective." However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany "social control takes place more in families" than in France. In addition, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents had built here. Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful." You have to "quickly give the young people the opportunity to participate in work and training". Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was largely quiet. Hundreds of police were on duty, a helicopter flew over the area with searchlights. The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars. Since the previous day, a contingent of around 1,000 security forces has been keeping things calm. Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs that the police would crack down as long as necessary. Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night. The riots spread to Toulouse the following night. The riots were sparked by a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday. According to the first findings of the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke The chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the content of the coalition is at an end - and that nothing more can be expected from her. In which country does this Chancellor actually live? After her dismal appearance in the general debate in the Bundestag, which was meaningless and lacking in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that she should finally rule. Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence. That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about. In the Bundestag, she clearly documented how true her accusation was. There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country. Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an aloof politician who flees into foreign policy and even there remains vague. Example of climate protection: She praises herself unreservedly for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country. In general, the self-praise - the CDU leader would have refused so much immodesty two years ago. Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is reaching people. In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of praising the world. But in Angela Wolke's empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon. Child poverty and the worries of low earners? She has a few subordinate clauses for it. It is significant how often she makes mistakes when it comes to the child allowance. Merkel needs three attempts to get a reasonably straight sentence out. She stumbles as if on unfamiliar territory when things get concrete.
Attack department In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney delivered a tough exchange of blows - and now have to fear an outsider candidate. The tension of the candidates discharges already with the first topic. Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of having made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants". He countered with serious allegations: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," replies Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed undocumented immigrants. The candidates are launching an attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents. The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are little more than keywords. "We allowed Hitler to come to power with this kind of isolationism," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the group to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq. Romney also gets the riot act from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, as torture. The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida show that the important issues of the campaign now go beyond the Iraq war and torture debates. Whenever conservative values are touted and future tax increases rejected, applause erupts in the auditorium. This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie. "I was wrong then," Romney explains contritely and apologizes to the base and television audience for the fact that in 1994 he was still an abortion advocate. Giuliani, on the other hand, falters when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs in civilian clothes for the first time One day after resigning as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president. This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan. Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday. Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital, Islamabad. Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation. On Wednesday he handed over his post as army chief to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States. Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time. With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a key demand of the opposition and the West. Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3rd. Soon after being sworn in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thereby fulfilling another demand from the West. The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf occupied with lawyers who favored him after the state of emergency was declared in early November, last week dismissed all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6. Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan. According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock return Germany's super group of the seventies makes music again: the three band members from Harmonia took up their consoles again at a concert in Berlin. A recording from their heyday "Live 1974" will be released for the revival. Even then they were much more famous abroad. The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the dinner table. Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons. Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the middle in a pristine white shirt at the age of 63. Flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of a laptop and guitar. On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is hunched over, concentrating at the console. Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat. And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music. That doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen themselves. The fact that the band Harmonia is making music again has caused quite a stir among Krautrock lovers. Although one may reveal here: targeted inquiries revealed that the name buzzed through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lastingly that this band had been sorely missed for 32 years. But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s? Especially since what was misleadingly called Krautrock was always more important in England and America than in their own country. When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, you could see questioning German pop faces in the hall. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also addressed the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked them, the astonishment knew no bounds. At concerts, Michael Rother would later sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy. The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration abroad is one thing. The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much smaller impact than they were subsequently assigned by others. Moebius and Roedelius had previously made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster. At first they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne. Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church. Rother had briefly helped out with Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time. Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland. There, in the Alter Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as communards who had fled the city. Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny. Rather in a pointed existence as an artist. Allegedly, a pennant from the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for the art were also found in the bulky waste. Harmonia captured some of it. The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following one "De Luxe". Because no matter how relaxed and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship. The gathering of brushwood was not just for self-discovery. The CD "Live 1974" that has now been released was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record crowd of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember. At that time, Rother wanted to push harmonia and practice it occasionally. An immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius. The band announced their split in 1975. Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen". Cluster was revived in the 80's and since then has been more successful than Harmonia ever was. We have Herbert Grönemeyer to thank for the Griessemer live album. Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating krautrock as the very own German contribution to living music. New! was already dug up like Roedelius' solo work. The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures. Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics festival. Julian Cope is here, the Brit, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler". There is also the Love Parade inventor Dr. Moth. Which outlines the entire range of influences of krautrock on the pop music that followed. Harmonia fills in the blank of the super group. Brian Eno's phrase floats in the hall with the strangest sounds: "The only true music, the future belongs to it." There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse room. Projections of further black-and-white photos of tangled wired devices serve to form the legend. Before that, the three veterans are busy improvising again. No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums in order to elicit outrageous tones from the instruments using self-made effect devices. Today electronic music looks like electronic music. Three technical inventors. The choir of the house doesn't change that either. Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, there will be coughing and whispering under clouds of sound and, at one point, with emphasis: "Aaaaaaaah!" sung. Krautrock was always a very English term. It was never rock. The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster). Who here "'68!" calls is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia don't let that bother them now. Even the most obvious things are thoroughly reconsidered on stage. Where does music start and when does it stop? This can get on your nerves or bring fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" two more films deal with the Balkan war. But both are not convincing. Either the concepts rely too much on action and banging, or they are too maudlin. Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either. The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has been found. We'd lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s because too many nice, inconsequential roles in feel-good movies for women and too many Buddhist-themed press conferences made you unwilling to look. Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted" (Why do film titles have to be so long and confusing these days like train driver collective agreements?). He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek portrayal: at heart, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere might have been if fate and the film industry weren't so kind: a man long past his very best, but who is himself as a ruin-like monument to its decline, it still has considerable remnants of its former charm. But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, together with the German production Mörderischer Frieden, also starting this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films. You can make short work of "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one of them promptly falls in love with her. Although it's welcome that the Serbs aren't portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the film, which is flat for TV, quickly loses itself in banging and action. It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a freeway but with war. On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an exemplary way of investigating why there has actually never been a really good Balkan war film. The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "The Fox" might have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at a different time be able. Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times, small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can't do, and both times it's a journey into madness. One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that they don't just let Simon Hunt be the down-and-out cynic with heart that he is introduced to us as at the beginning. No, the script also has to accuse him of having a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered. Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when the reporters manage within the last five minutes in fast motion what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not managed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and bring justice to the Muslim Bosnians left to revenge. This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic. The film has a deeply human concern. He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still walking around freely, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (on this point they should be in agreement for once) are not pursuing them too intensively because of secret political agreements. But the well-intentioned and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem springs to mind. It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I see the swollen veins in my forehead with compassion, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil". Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swollen heads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good. The problem is not limited to the Balkan war film genre. It was recently reported in this newspaper that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops. One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film either. It's almost always the case that when a star roams the world's trouble spots or minefields, the result is something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Limits" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time. After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List". Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", which are now considered classics, were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time. But maybe today, when every mass murder comes in real time on two screens at home, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world. And that robs screenwriters of the composure it takes to tell good stories. After all, "To Be or Not to Be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was. Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good films. Maybe you have to have novelist Lawrence Norfolk's sarcastically distant artist eye. When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "That's only because some things never change. Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust faces criticism for canceling the Olympics The mayor's move away from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism from politicians and businesspeople. Many want to keep fighting for the water games. But von Beust urges realism when assessing the chances. The general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a waiver as "not good for the business location". No other project has recently developed such great motivating forces in the city as the Olympic idea. "Without this goal, the political momentum in sport could not be maintained to the same extent." Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach "based on a changed timeline". Mayor Ole von Beust stuck to earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions, at least until 2028, were unrealistic. "Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE. He referred to the decision by the sports federation expected in early December about Munich's application for the 2018 Winter Games. "For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have been considering." Nevertheless, the dream is not over forever, said von Beust. The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust's statements. This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years. "It's too early to miss an opportunity by burying the plans at this point," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday. A waiver of the application also contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception for the general assembly of the General German University Sports Association. There von Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg. The University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city just last week. The SPD parliamentary group accused the Senate of not using valuable time to build housing in Hamburg. "The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it backed the Olympics and left out residential construction," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast. While the SPD has always called for integrated planning for the Olympics and later residential use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the "event factor". The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics triggered great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time. However, Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
Those aren't Warhol's boxes Anyone who associates the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol. Or is it? Wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are currently casting dark shadows on Warhol's catalog raisonné. Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo boxes listed there are fakes. After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes from 1968 a few months ago, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm have now come to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" that are in circulation on the international art market. The history is convoluted, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions. In 1964 in New York, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red, blue and white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder. An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes: These did not come from Warhol (for reasons of cost) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard box factory. These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits. At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, although these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet. Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes that rightly went down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm". Some of them have fetched more than $100,000 at auction. The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then gave him. In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg. At that point, Warhol had already been dead for three years. Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined the museum's six Brillo boxes as well as three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboard panels were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush. The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without a primer - moreover, it is not oil paint but acrylic paint. "These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not comes to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in its collection as copies/exhibition material." In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" made about the soap powder boxes. But since then, there has been a relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who had holed up in a Manila hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered. The leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and voter fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not be held responsible for any bloodshed. Soldiers loyal to the government had previously stormed the hotel using tear gas. The approximately two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours. Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes. He used the negotiation to suddenly break away with around 30 sympathizers. The MPs who were supposed to be guarding him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny. They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
