Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians They are less than 100 meters apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light went into operation in Gutach's village car park - within sight of the older traffic lights in the town hall. Two systems so close together: on purpose or silly prank? Gutach's mayor gave a clear answer to this question yesterday. "The traffic lights in the town hall were installed back then because they make it easier to get to school," Eckert explained yesterday. The Kluser traffic light keeps cyclists, bus passengers and Bergle residents safe. The system, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area. We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the flow of traffic from the ›Grub‹ residential area. "With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light was needed for their safety," says Eckert. This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg district office. "According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles drive through the community of Gutach on the B 33 every day, around ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic," emphasizes Arnold. Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply comes first here," says Arnold. A total of four traffic inspections were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but rejected again because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection. According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when choosing the location for the traffic light masts: "Using a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles could drive out of Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without knocking over the traffic light mast". The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the "most modern thing currently on the market," explained Arnold. The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be clearly seen by drivers, for example even when the sun is low in the sky. And it's also economical: the older lighting systems consume around 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts. There are three lights in each direction. Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors. If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation. If the road is clear, pedestrians will see green immediately, if not, it takes around 15 seconds. Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian. "Should a group or people with walking difficulties cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the road safely," explained Arnold. Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and observe the road. This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic light for pedestrians turned green, a luxury vehicle rushed through - with a bright red light.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing down the troubles of his childhood and youth. The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the penchant for brute force and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness. The Büchner prizewinner is best known as a prose author; theater texts are rare in his work. Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher has therefore put together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterglühen auf der Tonungspitze", which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz. For example, the theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "The Serf" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, Belauernd seine Familie" (2003). On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which there are hints of copulating and masturbating - the eight-strong ensemble shimmy through the text material. Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text. The 70-minute performance covers the template with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play. The actresses in particular get their turn in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations. They are grabbed hard, their heads are submerged under water, their evening robes are stapled to the wall. Squeezed into cellophane or bodices, they stride through the production on dangerously high heels, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor. However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strained way. The evening has the best moments when there is singing - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to folk songs. Only towards the end does the over-the-top performance calm down a bit, and Winkler's downright absurd humor flashes.
Königsfeld: Small team does a good job The volunteer fire brigade passed its autumn main test with flying colors despite a lack of personnel. Only eleven men took part in the exercise. Department commander Hans Kammerer chose the Feder property on Burgberger Strasse for his exercise assignment. A short circuit is said to have occurred there when sawing. Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call. After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two firefighters wearing breathing apparatus got ready to enter the building. After a short time, the first person was found and escorted outside. The second person had to be carried. This was not so easy, as there were also narrow stairs to overcome. The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure. A lot of wood and bales of straw were stored in it. There were also electric machines for woodworking. The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle. Another line was via an above ground hydrant about 100 meters away. Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed. A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building. For Hans Kammerer, the exercise was also about showing what can be done with little staff available. In an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily task force. The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President of the State Parliament, Guido Wolf, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow's workforce will come from. In the support center in the Black Forest, he investigated this important question together with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the district high school and the chairmen of the parents' council. "Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thoma School, which presented the networked school project Education Center Black Forest. Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training. Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the support center, district high school and vocational school center in the forest town. He also praised the family friendliness in the district. "It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also on the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," explained Wolf. He also stated that more and more employees took care of the care and support of their relatives. "Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of employment," said Wolf. But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said. Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies. "Because those who have already got to know the advantages of the region during their studies often remain in the regional economy with the knowledge and skills they have acquired, which contributes to strengthening the region," said the President of the State Parliament with conviction. The demand for skilled workers can only be met if sufficient training places are offered. In his opinion, the locational advantage of the district is its advantageous location in south-west Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland. On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport. "Remain persistent and make sure that local public transport gets better," he said to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the senior citizens of Dieting to coffee, cake and then a snack. In the past, the older fellow citizens were entertained in the service area. This afternoon now takes place in the St. Josef nursing home. The residents enjoyed the delicious cakes and tarts. Later there was sausage salad. Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary between the old schoolyard and Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, is to be included in the city of Bräunlingen's renovation cost plan. In the days before Kilbig, a small angle wall was installed during the first renovation work on the front schoolyard to stabilize and relieve the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade. According to Alexander Misok from Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure envisages involving the State Monuments Office in the planning and creating a renovation concept for the old wall. After that, a cost calculation should be made by experts, which should then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed. A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year. After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be completely renovated and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure. The historic, hundred-year-old wall separating the old schoolyard from Kirchstraße is in need of renovation, mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, and has a forward arch. Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not in danger of collapsing. A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been achieved by the current fortification work. The renovation of the schoolyard was originally planned for 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses made it postponed. The State Monuments Office will have an important say in the renovation of the historic school wall, which has even been used for filming. If specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the preservationists. The pupils of the Bräunlingen elementary school, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart Cem Özdemir, federal chairman of the Greens, has now also got involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg. "I think it's wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music Academy," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten". Jazz and classical belong together in the jazz location Stuttgart. Özdemir, who is considered the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the federal elections on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government. On the basis of an expert study, this promotes a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg. According to this, among other things, the jazz and pop course is to be relocated from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "super tunnel" used for drug smuggling discovered On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" used for drug smuggling. According to US customs officials, the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system. Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated. According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been put into use. "These cartels are stupid if they think they can sneak under the radar," Southern California Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a news conference outside a San Diego warehouse, where the spotted one end of the tunnel had been. Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you keep building tunnels like this and trying to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money". Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels. Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in drug-related crimes in Mexico. Constructed by experts Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year. The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there. On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border. According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance. The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide. He would have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States. Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find. The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the marijuana confiscated. All three face the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said. Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006, it said at the press conference in San Diego. But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction. Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels. This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego. They would do anything to get to the US. No details were given about those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it said. They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be a year of celebrations in Geisingen The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary of the first documented mention is getting closer and closer. When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is approaching. Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794. A document was made in churches in which both places are mentioned. On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen. As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen. Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1250th anniversary on a festival weekend from July 18th to 20th. On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle. On this festival weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener church festival. Town Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates. On June 21 together with the midsummer celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of the town music in the new festival hall. This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend in September, on September 27th and 28th. On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is published. "It should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler. And today's Geisingen is also celebrating its birthday in 2014. In 1974, today's spatial structure was completed with the incorporations. The new chronicle should then be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new festival hall in Geisingen. But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries. The fool's guild of Strohglonki begins on February 8th with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th. The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from July 4th to 7th. The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation held by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764. The document was made in Kirchen (Hausen), which was then the place of justice. Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document. Reason enough to celebrate this 1250th anniversary in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform was 40 years ago.
Council targets track systems Should the "Am Hirschen" level crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety? Yes, the municipal councils have decided. Schiltach has to pay 220,000 euros for this. Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year. In particular, safety at level crossings is to be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles regularly occur nationwide. If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, with the railways and the federal government sharing the rest. Schiltach's master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the level crossing "Am Hirschen" to the municipal council. The city is planning to build a bulge there west of the railway tracks at the level of the mouth of the tunnel there. Larger vehicles, for example those transporting long timber, could also park there in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks. Grießhaber therefore suggested constructing a required retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjoining street in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic. This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councilors questioned the necessity of widening the road: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to spend so much money because of so few vehicles?" Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" level crossing is regularly used for transporting long timber. Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is sometimes transported over this route because the vehicles, which are up to 20 meters long, cannot use the route at the Häberles Bridge because they cannot turn onto the main road there. In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued. Since it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the level crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time. The councils agreed to have it examined , which costs the planned widening of the road would cause. Regardless of this, the conversion of the level crossing was approved by a majority with the stipulation that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can open the adjoining road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 meters could be expanded. The conversion of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could result in a completely different problem, which affects access to the steeply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg”. The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, since Had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs is then still possible without further ado. The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the gradient of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on it. The city, in turn, is responsible for this as the road construction authority. The conversion could therefore result in liability disputes. Haas argued that since both the wood removal and turning work in the current state of development, the conversion of the level crossing should not be approved. At this point, the risk of the train colliding with a vehicle standing on the level crossing is also significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because the Mitte stop is right next to it, with which there is a good line of sight. Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down at this point so that there was no risk of a collision. The majority of the remodeling of this level crossing was refused approval because the city of Schiltach "would have to pay for the problem with vehicles that were riding on it", according to the councillors, since the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work had been completed. The committee considers the conversions at the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" level crossings, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railways, to be unproblematic.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions of distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years. There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the running. distant worlds. Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets near other stars. Nobody knows whether there is life on at least some of them. The choice is difficult: should one look for gravitational waves? Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos? Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life? Those responsible at the European space agency Esa are asking themselves these questions. For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that should decisively advance research. The budget for such "L missions" is around one billion euros. The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034. At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions. 30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted. Numerous committees examine the proposals and follow up with the researchers. A final decision is to be made by the scientific program committee in the next few days. Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program initiated in 2007 should find answers. What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life? The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness. A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness. And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there? In order to investigate this question, the "Cheops" space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined more closely. But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros. With larger instruments, the astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered indicators of biological activity. How does the solar system work? This question, too, should ultimately provide information about the prerequisites for the emergence of life. The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system play an important role. In our solar system, these processes can be examined as examples. With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved an M-class mission (the budget there is around half a billion euros) for this question. The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the Sun's surface and activity. Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers. They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system. For this, Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program. The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022. Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and is to study the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. What are the basic physical laws of the universe? The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there. There may also be deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be combined. How did the universe come about and what is it made of? 13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang. In addition to the matter we are familiar with, from which stars, planets and living beings like us are made, there is dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe. So far, researchers have not known which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of. With "Euclid", Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020. With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Who could win the race Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process. According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-mission. Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago. To date, they have not been proven. Elisa could make it, the scientists behind the project hope. The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space. In contrast to facilities on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos. Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which, among other things, is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to Measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is intended to detect and study Earth-like planets. Proposals for transporting samples back from Mars, for exploring the moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics have already been eliminated.
Proverbs come from the Bible A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of the year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen. Topics of the day in the parish hall were "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Idioms from the Middle Ages". After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the parish council, went into the biblical proverbs in a lecture. "Proverbs contain wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained. She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning. She used proverbs like: wooden eyes beware, scales fall from your eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence. On several occasions, the speaker asked her listeners to guess which proverb it was. The parish councilor Christel Dehner took on the idioms from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make you blue, beat something up. She explained the meaning and origin of the idioms, which she called "bridges into the past". At the end of the day, a raffle was drawn. The prizes were laid out on a table and humorously described before being presented to the winners. Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger also mingled with the visitors to the breakfast group.
Learning instead of being unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today in the Mecklenburg Lake District. Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to become specialists for hotels and restaurants. "What's new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency. The benefits are manifold: the participants would not become unemployed, the companies would get trained specialists, which are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment. The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-West Pomerania are also involved in the project.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307. Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy office manager of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen. Because numerous companies have so far reacted cautiously to hiring. According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We hardly have any skilled workers in the trades, in the health sector and in geriatric care". Depending on the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been coming in again since September. The winter season there begins in mid-December. You can find the entire background report on this in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of October 31, 2013 (page 33).
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time). While the airport management announced via the short message service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead. A security guard was also killed. The media also reported several injuries. US President Barack Obama will be kept informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney. The incident took place in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, multiple media outlets reported. A traveler told CNN that many people had panicked and sought shelter. Travelers screamed and children cried. Panic broke out among those waiting, and many hid behind chairs out of fear. A traveler told the Los Angeles Times that he heard two shots. An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. The scene was "like in a movie". Then he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported. The shots are said to have fallen near a security checkpoint. Airport building evacuated TV images showed numerous ambulances and police cars pulling up in front of a terminal. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building. Users on Twitter posted photos of a special task force and a rifle lying on the ground. As the airport management announced on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time). The access roads were closed, resulting in long tailbacks, according to CNN. Except for landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said. However, several planes could also be observed on CNN at the start. Terminal 3 is primarily served by smaller US airlines. Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Revolutionary work of church music At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert. After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the wreath of songs will enrich two church services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe. On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. during the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf. The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time it was written. The mass is performed as part of the church services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind. Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is increasingly giving way to confidence With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral care unit in Haslach (SE). There will then only be one parish council for all six parishes. In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes. Because nothing can be changed about the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible. In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is slowly but surely giving way to confidence. The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-time officials of the pastoral care team ranged from the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the parish council. Regional Dean Georg Schmitt used a presentation to explain the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the archdiocese of Freiburg. According to this, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a corporation under public law, which will take over the rights and duties of the six individual parishes up to now. There will only be one common parish council and one foundation council, in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented. At least two elected members should be represented from each parish. So-called community teams are formed locally in the six parishes. In the future, your task will be to promote church life in the village. When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parishes, there was a considerable need for discussion. The innovations provide for accumulated credits in the parishes to remain earmarked. The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole. There were great concerns, especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which will then affect all parishes. "Even in the past, investments were only made in projects that the individual parishes could manage on their own," put Haslach's parish council chairman, Bruno Prinzbach, into perspective. Barbar Ritter, chairperson of the committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes. In 2006 they set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" and had to realize that it wasn't that easy. The committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit then set about answering the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams. The elaborations will be specified in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six committees next spring. At the end, parish councilor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved with a clear majority.
Electricity is getting more expensive in Pfullendorf The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs. As the managing director of the public utility company, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four in Pfullendorf faces additional costs of 70 to 90 euros per year. The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour. This levy is reassessed every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines. They quantify the additional costs they incur as a result of the energy transition, which they can levy through a surcharge on the electricity price. Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain. The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher surcharge in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports. Now the specific figures would have to be calculated before the public utility company could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week. "We are assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, although the number would be closer to 2 cents.
Traffic light permanently red: watch out for waiting time Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green. The contact loop in the street does not react or the light signal is defective. What to do then - drive on red? If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue driving, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad". However, the waiting time must be "reasonable", which can be interpreted differently from case to case. Becker advises waiting at least five minutes before assuming that the traffic light is malfunctioning. However, anyone who continues to drive despite the red light must be aware that they are fully to blame for any accident caused by it. Becker warns that anyone who waits less than five minutes may not be waiting long enough, referring to a decision by the Hamm Higher Regional Court. In the case under discussion, a driver ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation. The traffic light was not defective, but switched to green a little later. He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation – but not the fine.
Municipal council is happy about solid budget Mayor Ralph Gerster always has a good laugh when the budget is discussed in municipal council meetings. The municipal fund in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not had any debts since 2005. In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be viewed as a complete success. This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented. As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than EUR 1 million higher than planned. The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the estimate. The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenue and the municipality's share of income tax. The capital budget was again well above the planned values. Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year. "This is essentially due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," says Rothmund. Since fewer investments than planned were made in the 2012 financial year, the allocation to reserves was also higher. Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros. Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work. "You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," praised Gerster, looking at the annual accounts. He and the local councilors were visibly pleased with the good figures. It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon cost citizens dearly. Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high assessment rates in the past. As a result, however, according to Gerster, grants from the state have often been reduced. There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensation funds. Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain assessment rates. "We have to look at the subject of multipliers, as there are investments in the coming years for which we would like grants," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history with the Cäcilia male choir is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was honored. As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colors of his male choir. Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which he has grown to love. Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee. He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst. His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and an engraved pewter plate. In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival went on as usual: with the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten Liederkranz, the Baisingen singers’ department and the local music club, the Vollmaringer invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors. The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Funny, you brothers". To honor their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied". The men's singing group Betra also sang classic choral songs such as "Hunters" by Julius Wengert, "Far, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you walk through the valley". With its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - the Liederkranz Salzstetten provided for the women's quota of the festival. The mixed choir took Antos Gus' "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk tune, while the "Impulschor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program. The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Club came up with "What's that Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to home, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion. There was a small side program for the children - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer put on a puppet show and read a few stories, which kept the children busy throughout the afternoon.
Children's dreams come true The kindergartens and day-care centers in the Zollernalb district are getting mail these days. In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote would like to support the institutions in realizing their building and beautification wishes. Does the kindergarten need a new sandpit? All kindergartens, day care centers and crèches from the entire Zollernalb district can take part in the campaign. If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply to the Black Forest Messenger. Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the kindergarten construction site campaign. A jury consisting of representatives from the Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions. What are the requirements for participation? The wish should be able to be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (campaign) day. In addition, the winner himself has to provide many hard-working construction workers. What is the action day and the helpers all about? Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb. It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers. Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC Despite the cold weather and rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost none of its importance for the city and the football club. Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Petrus didn't want to play along. So all those who came without an umbrella or couldn't hold one for some reason were left behind. The musicians who framed the ceremony felt the same way as did many a speaker. That's why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, got wet. Above all, he thanks Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the club members who got involved. Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf. The energetic pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths. Karl Rombach, member of the Landtag, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment. Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the southern Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club, also spoke welcoming speeches for the municipal sports committee. Mayor Klumpp reminded us that the recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn damaged the original lawn so much that it could not be played on. The first thoughts about solving the problem were already 15 years ago, when the idea of building a third pitch at the football club site or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered. Both were rejected again. Six years ago, thoughts arose about creating an artificial turf pitch, which was widely considered to be the ultimate solution. Concrete planning began two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube on a long-term lease, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the field and the state approved subsidies of 104,000 euros. In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros of the total costs of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp. Construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf field began on June 4th. During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used to create a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice. For this purpose, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning. Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery of MPs and the federal police. The migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its deliberations in the morning. Among other things, it should be about the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas. The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport. On the topic of traffic, which is not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD underscored its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU. A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and therefore ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group. There was a threat of alternative traffic on country roads, which are already accident black spots. In Pronold's view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step. "There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be canceled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing foehn wave on the Stuttgart open-air stage - "When will it really be summer again?" wasn't really the question on Friday evening at the Killesberg open-air stage. It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart. The best conditions for pop star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band. Click through the picture gallery to see the performance of the "singing Föhnwelle".
Driver seriously injured in accident A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening. According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath at around 9:15 p.m. When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old. The vehicles collided. The man from Aachen suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustrasse on Thursday evening around 8 p.m. Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was in the left turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstrasse and switched to the right lane. This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old from Konstanz who was driving there. The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW was also damaged. A total of around 15,000 property damage was caused, the police said. The roadway had to be closed while the accident was being recorded, it said.
Vienna Airport eliminates passenger calls Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24. There will be no more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future. A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be reduced significantly. The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere. As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by stopping announcements that affect individuals. The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, for example, are already doing without the noisy calls. By eliminating these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls are heard through the loudspeakers a day - things should be quieter at the airport in future. "Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information about changed gates or departure times is a bit lost here," said Kleemann in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof In addition to pulling the brake van with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from September 6th to 8th. The Highlander Games start at 1.30 p.m. on Saturday, September 7th. Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have a Swabian touch at the Kaltenhof. Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of throwing logs, throwing horseshoes and carrying buckets of water. The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms. "It doesn't depend on the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile. The trunk must be thrown off vertically, should roll over once and then come to a straight stop. This is rated with the most points. When it comes to horseshoe throwing, accuracy is key. A stake is thrown from eight meters away. The participants have to prove their dexterity and strength by carrying water buckets over 50 meters. Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end. Two from each "clan" or team can then take part in the individual competition. Prizes will be awarded to the winners of the team and individual competitions. Training can begin at 10 a.m. Appropriate clothing is desirable, for example the competitors can compete in a kilt. But Swabian costumes are also allowed. The jury awards a few bonus points for the "outfit". You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition. With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday. In the evenings, fans of brass band music will get their money's worth. At 7 p.m., the Bira-Bohemian brass band from Schömberg creates the great evening of entertainment. The band plays lively polkas and marches. Their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound. Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen, known as the singing innkeeper and black sausage baron, will be there. In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fools' guild. On Sunday, the Leinstetten music club will be entertaining for a morning pint, from 2 p.m. the Böffingen farmers' band will be guests, and the "oldies" will then round off the festival. The stubble acker party with DJ Ralf starts on Friday. Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the classic car and tractor meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry. Other Sunday attractions include the corn maze, craft market and sheep shearing. Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing. The organizers are the Förderverein multi-purpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives A vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products. For example, pureed tofu with vegetable cream is a quark substitute. The Vegetarian Association names more for World Vegan Day on November 1st. On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1st, the German Vegetarian Association is proposing a number of vegan alternatives: pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt can be replaced with soy yoghurt. Soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used instead of milk. Whipped vegetable cream replaces conventional whipped cream. There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs. Half a mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake. You can also use 50 grams of applesauce or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water. Instead of using egg, dough can be loosened with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water. But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can also serve this purpose. According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students at the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York. After an eight-hour flight, we headed straight for the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot. Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly attractive in the evening light. Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city never sleeps", the day ended in Times Square. Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot. Then we went via the financial center around Wall Street to the Memorial of September 11th. On the third day, the students were able to get an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373 meter high observation deck of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view. Then we went through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun. After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstrasse. According to legend, St. Hubertus was a ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège. The hunting horn group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on par force horns (natural horns tuned to E flat) to old, originally French melodies. The horns wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and packs of dogs on drag hunts musically. The solemn mass will take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 am.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe. One that invites you to linger and come back. One that wants to make the name part of the program. According to the lexicon, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before. If you visit the café of the same name on the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, you don't have to stay with a pure déjà vu feeling. After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not just mental, but tangible and experience it again and again. Because it's fun and simply beautiful. A look inside Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling. The ultra-modern, but not cold, café ambience looks like a place to relax. Here, the team, led by the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, spoils the guest with a wide variety of coffee and cocktail varieties. There are also delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes. The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café on Opschlag: They ran the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg. The sympathetic café lovers hope that the move to Kleve on the Opschlag will attract more visitors. Not least because of the university. "We don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner. Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between. Speaking of cafe lovers. The likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment. Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations yourself. Expresso fan Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker. "A baguette with it - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ. There have already been two events in the bright café. Better said one. Because the harbor festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu didn't benefit from it. But there was also the Ringelnatz evening. "Nice, successful and funny," said the two 33-year-olds. But not for everyone. Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event evenings: "You can't please everyone". And with an event, I always only address those who are also interested in the special event. That's why events will tend to be the exception for us. "We want to disrupt normal operations as little as possible." That means: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability. In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve. The street that is increasingly developing into a gastronomic mile. To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students, who are discovering the gastro mile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves. Anke Gellert-Helpenstein
A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come. In the clubhouse of the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness dedicated to music. Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right celebration to honor people. This time secretary Rolf Wagener was happy about the special award "Singer of the Year". "You not only wrote down a lot for us, but also did quite a few laps for us, for which we thank you very much," said the chairman of the choir, Erich Schlotmann. This year, the awards for participation in performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to choirmaster Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler, each with 42 participations. Artur Brückner, the grade manager, took fifth place. The board of directors gave a special thank you to the team led by the club's landlady, Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a first-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations. The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. in the clubhouse. "We always welcome new singing voices," says Schlotmann.
Even if SG Achim/Baden hasn't won for four matchdays, the upper league handball team is still in a good mood. Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that. Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter. Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again. "Because I don't even know what a win like that tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II Index finger. I coached many players myself when I was a junior. Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach. "It is also important to wait and see whether there will be reinforcements from the first team," explains the SG coach. In order to finally get back on the road to success, the Malmon team definitely needs to step up compared to past performances. Above all, in the cover work and in the switching game, there was a huge problem in the end. The exploitation of chances definitely needs to improve as well. So I hope that my players have finally cleared their minds during the short break.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again 100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof". The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene play. Screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk designed an entertaining play from the moment of arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk. Marcus Zagermann took the audience with him as speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged leaps in time from youth to approaching retirement. On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his Freihof. And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his prime role as the city's big boy. True to style, he drove up with the pair and "Black Forest Foxes" owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach. Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, his sister Philippine also welcomed him. Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well how to put himself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures. Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach peasant band played suitably selected pieces of music, rounding off the performance. Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler, who represented the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council, paid his respects to the awarding of honorary citizenship. The singers of the Epiphany then paid their respects, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how nice, my youthful memories of my own Epiphany are coming alive again". With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Stork Day children with their loud "Out, out". At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war. He found his resting place in his homeland, behind his burial chapel on the Brand near Hofstetten. "A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the play. There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hopes of the Neckar Riesen are growing The chances of remaining in the league for the relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball team have increased. Because if there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Riesen. The Hamburg Towers basketball project will not apply for a possible replacement spot. "We will not participate in the wildcard process," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012. A first relief could not be heard from Ludwigsburg. "We didn't deal with the wildcard procedure as long as it wasn't certain that Düsseldorf would not receive a license," Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper. Up until May 23, Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga. So far, the Rhinelanders have been refused the license twice. The arbitral tribunal is the final instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Eucharist comes into focus As the city's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's culture and tourism office is dedicating the last of this year's public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Holy Communion. After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, Haigerloch's time after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule, should be looked at. The crowning glory is a visit to the Church of the Holy Communion. There, the tour participants are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area. Last but not least, the church also catches a glimpse of the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter. It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model by Leonardo da Vinci. The meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum. Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum. The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also testify in Russia The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair. Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia. The Interfax agency reported this, citing unspecified circles that were familiar with the situation. Such a question could be clarified between states, it said. It is practically impossible for Snowden to leave Russia. "In that case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying. Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatened with extradition there, it said
Staying power pays off Six men's teams fought for the title at the clubs' tennis tournament. In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match. The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf received fantastic weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends. The focus of the tournament was on having fun playing tennis. There were five games per team, with everyone playing against everyone else. The game was played in doubles mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes. Anja Schlichter directs the tournament The tournament director was in the capable hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer. After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase. The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both SG Rohrweiler teams), so the last two matches had to bring the decision. At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to present the challenge cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the home stretch. Second place went to the doubles Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic. The bronze podium went to Rainer and Bernd Maier from the Asphaltriecher team. The successful conclusion of the tournament took place with late afternoon sun and coffee and cake.
On the last weekend in August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is firmly in the hands of children again. Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous hands-on activities and events. "Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release. Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age. Regional craftsmen are on hand to help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. People also work in the museum workshop. The young guests can put their manual skills to the test by building cuckoo whistles, water wheels or spinning tops. The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or walking on stilts, also promise a lot of fun. Speed and coordination are required here. For all little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. On a tour of the site, the children have to guess which stories are true or which are lies. In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes. Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site. In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be up to his practical jokes with the museum guests from 11 a.m. Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner's is cozy and fairytale-like. At 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., the storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales. In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m. Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom maker, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder at their traditional work. A varied holiday program awaits visitors to the open-air museum until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable oddball because he has decided to take part in a race in America on his 1920 motorcycle. Despite a heart defect, Burt cannot be dissuaded from his dream. With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he sails to Los Angeles. After the film there will be coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land. They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile. The company has several irons in the fire at the site. In addition to importing coal, Rhenus Midgard focuses on wind turbine logistics, among other things. The black coal shimmers in the storage area in front of the dyke. Two huge blue dumpers and reclaimers distribute or load the coal here as needed. Every time the handling equipment moves, a shrill warning noise sounds across the site. "The signals serve to ensure safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven. Unfortunately, when the wind is unfavorable, this can be heard from afar - and so there have already been some complaints from people in the north of the city. He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old. In close consultation with the authorities, technical measures are now being taken to keep the warning signals quieter. He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbors in the future. Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot planned for the location. With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the big players in Europe in this sector. Thanks to the sunbath in front of the terminal, which is 18.5 meters deep, cape-size bulk carriers have long been able to be handled here. "This year we want to break the 3 million ton mark in handling," says Schrell. In addition to the on-site Eon power station, the imported coal goes to inland power stations. If the GDF-Suez power plant were also connected to the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year would be realistic. The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could handle up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball players optimistic despite their first defeat Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich. "No one can stop us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champions Olympiacos Piraeus. We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich! In only their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases. The visitors first managed to convert a 15-point deficit into a lead with 13 minutes remaining before Piraeus turned the game around again. "We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champions, but then made careless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi. We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game. Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers for the Munich team, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations process A week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process. "After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page. There is still a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill playmates with machete Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old. The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them. Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday. Then they played football in front of their apartments in a working-class district. The body was found the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este. As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger boy, whom they took away, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy. However, when the girl described the course of events to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old. One of the reasons given by the older man was a rivalry in football. He was temporarily admitted to a juvenile psychiatric institution.
The Constance Regional Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm. The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement. According to this, in five cases he met women through internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent out on the streets against their will after a few weeks. He used to break resistance with violence and threats. He withheld the earnings of the women, some of whom had worked for him for years. By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he cut off women's contact with the outside world. Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest. There he had them monitored in part in order to control their income. The accused initially claimed in court that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion next to him. After a psychiatric expert indicated that he had serious doubts about the mental limitations and thus limited criminal responsibility, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession. The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women. As a police officer reported, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after an initial report through telephone surveillance measures. The intercepted conversations were characterized by a high level of aggression. In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom. Another witness, on whom one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, has not made a statement to this day. It is about "a completely broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this profession. The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday. "He has broken away from these circles and wants to lead a completely normal life after his imprisonment," he said.
The happiness of dreaming camels Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach. With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the "Helfende Hände" association. On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable success. The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association. He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott. As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips. During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen so that the guests at the anniversary event could get an idea of the actions mentioned. The club's desert vehicle was also on display. It is a former Federal Border Patrol vehicle. Rainer Prewo, the former Mayor of Nagold, had made the suggestion to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work for the association in an advisory capacity. In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbronn built the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis. Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott. This is particularly interesting at a time when the maternity hospital in Nagold is to be rationalized away. As a doctor, you learn a lot in Africa, says Henne, for example slowing down to prevent burnout. Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to travel as much as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to sit in on different areas. In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year. Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by talking about Mercedes vehicles from Mauritania that had been converted into mobile goat stalls and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania. He cited his work in auditing as a young MP as his personal motivation. When he realized how much money was being lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans get a budget overseen by the people. Fuchtel also emphasized that global economy also requires global philanthropy. It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than many people think. From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
In protest against the planned tax on the wealthy, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972. A conciliation meeting ends without result. In the conflict over the tax on the wealthy, the government and professional football in France have reached a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting. President François Hollande received club and association representatives on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris and also listened to their complaints. However, he refused to exempt football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014. The other side also remained firm. The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel. The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between November 29 and December 2 are therefore cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible "We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen. Around 80 participants came to the community hall to have the planned measures explained to them, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas. Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council". According to Häußler, the flood that hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009 was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future. A river basin study was commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen. "The goal is to protect as many developed plots as possible," says Häußler. The planning is based on protection against a flood that is statistically to be expected every 100 years according to the German Weather Service. Climate change is taken into account with a 15 percent surcharge. In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima". The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year flood. "There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler. In order to achieve protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the community can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent. However, Häußler pointed out that funding is only available if an overall concept is implemented. To achieve this, the municipality relies on the participation of the citizens. A complex planning and approval process must be completed. In the best-case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016. Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented to the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the tributary of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley. After the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns. Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the site. Gregor Kühn, specialist planner from the contracted engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that all the measures presented need to work together in order to achieve the desired goal overall. In addition, one is obliged to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe. Residents of the old town were dissatisfied, who repeatedly suffer from overloading of the sewer network even during normal thunderstorms. The problem is known to the administration and first measures have already been taken. However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and that these should not be mixed up. The community is obliged to design the sewer system in such a way that two to three-year rain events can be coped with. Increasing the size of the sewers would cost millions.
Seriously injured after a collision Early on Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf. The police immediately blocked the road completely, but initially could not say much about the course of the accident. However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated. What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came towards her with his Hyundai. Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so badly trapped that it took the fire department almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage. The actual cause of the accident initially remained unclear. Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals. The route remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA. Philip K. Dick was a seeker after God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial. The relationship on the outside is amazing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead. And in the same way that Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the explorer and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is well regarded in his own country. Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is sold by Zweitausendeins. Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress coupled with paranoia, security obsession and the belief in being chosen. Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual. Maybe he was crazy, drugs had wreaked havoc on his brain. He understood early on that computers are divinities. He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the creator from his creature. That's the "Blade Runner" problem. The killing. A master of science fiction. A fantastic writer. His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg. This story is especially significant now. The "Minority Report" dates from 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals. The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House. In Dick's world, which is frighteningly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police take action. "We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the agency. "We catch them before they can commit a violent crime." And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penal camp full of pseudo-criminals." You read streams of time. They assume that bad things will happen and prevent the criminal idea from becoming a reality. Dick's story acts as the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terror laws and wiretapping frenzy. Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works. But Dick's story isn't over yet. The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state. Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime. The system is going crazy. It's perfect, but it lies. It invents its own premises. Not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them. The system creates the danger it fights. Reading Philip K. Dick means, again and again, getting closer to the truth.
Testify about Merkel spy affair in Russia The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair about Chancellor Angela Merkel. Representatives of the German federal prosecutor's office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the Interfax agency reported. The Greens member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions "Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard. A special fair in the domain in Hechingen gave tips on how at least the wedding celebration should be successful. Important suppliers around a wedding were represented. A trend: the retro look is back. It starts with the wedding dresses. White is a must, preferably muted or cream. The often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed at the front, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a train. However, opinions differ, as emphasized by Stefanie Koch from theclothing mill fashion house. For men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen. The selection of the restaurant is important, it was explained. Unadorned adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special. Here the domain draws attention to its own offer in the depot. If you then want to drive up in a carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you. "Carriages are also popular for hen parties," he says. Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures. The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - that is, a series of shots in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel. Many other details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain. Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style. Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care. Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful Once again, the athletes from the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament. Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points and secured fifth place in the beginner class, and with 15-month-old Marley he placed twelfth with 87 points. Susi Höpp and her Woody in Class 1 faced the critical gaze of the judge.
Unknowns injure girl by shot from car Unknowns injured a twelve-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt when shots were fired from a car. The perpetrators had probably fired an airgun at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening. This was announced by the police in Burg. The girl was slightly injured on the left calf. Paramedics took the girl to the hospital. The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped. Witnesses saw two people in the car. The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop. A pane broke. Then they drove away. The criminal police determined, it said on Friday.
To date, the Kempten police station can look back on a quiet Halloween night. The officials were only called twice to the egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades. Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no property damage should have occurred. Furthermore, some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably set off in the city area, but there was no property damage here either. A resident on Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel covers were stolen. However, by the time the police arrived, the man had found all of his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with prospects for the future Waltraud Ries actually lives like a dream. Your house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic. The city is only a few minutes away by public transport. "I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame. I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and I for some time. But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart. The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains. Also: since a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap. She recently published a book on the subject of 'Living happily in old age - which type of housing is best for me?'. 'Our apartment is the best example of what's not possible in old age,' she begins to tell. When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery. Now in his mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it. But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'. Most put it off while they can. It's always the others who grow old', she says with a smile. Only when the suffering is really great do you think about it. 'By then it can already be too late,' says Ries. In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age. 'But which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains. There is no solution for old age. Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become ill. And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language you get lonely even in the dolce vita,' the author of the specialist book points out to people who want to emigrate. Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often quoted shared flat for pensioners. As we age, everyone has their quirks and quirks. 'A flat share like that wouldn't be for me,' she says with a wink. Especially not like in a shared student apartment with a shared bathroom and kitchen. 'When you get old you just need a place to retreat to,' says Ries. However, the author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior living community can still function. But that would have to be different than in the classic student flat share. And sometimes you just want peace and quiet', she believes. At least in the state capital, she is not the only one with this opinion. 'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible,' is the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizens' service for older people in the state capital. Your office advises people on all aspects of 'getting older'. This is why older people in particular would often put up with inconveniences and limitations just to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest. Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free. Ries recommends everyone who is involved in converting their house or apartment to make them age-appropriate first of all and not to hire the first craftsman who comes along. Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversions. Even in a rented apartment, one or the other can be implemented, and if it's just the raised toilet seat, the interior designer explains. But it is not always possible to redesign an existing apartment to make it age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, no matter how beautifully located it is. Waltraud Ries had to experience this. Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path to the apartment door, which is also paved with stairs, would be the much greater obstacle. She will keep looking until she finds the ideal property for herself and her husband. She dreads the move more than the spider on her front door.
US plans to continue prosecuting Snowden The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence official Edward Snowden. He continues to be accused of having passed on secret information without permission. Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the United States, said US State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington. Even Snowden's recent statements would not change that. The German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him with punishment. Psaki emphasized that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Secret service investigator Edward Snowden is in principle ready for talks with German authorities. First, however, he wants his situation clarified. The former NSA employee wanted by the USA made this clear in an unaddressed letter that the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General. According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording: To those responsible I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance. My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I am a former contract and direct employment technical expert with the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). In the course of my employment in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government that have prompted me to act out of a moral duty. As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have faced serious and ongoing incitement that has forced me to leave my family and home. I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law. I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere. Citizens around the world, as well as high officials - including the United States - have viewed the revelations about a system of overarching, unaccountable surveillance as a service to the public. These espionage revelations prompted many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at previously covert abuses of public trust. The benefit to society from the knowledge gained is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted were visibly reduced. Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my administration continues to treat dissent as breach of trust and seeks to criminalize and criminalize political expression. However, speaking the truth is not a crime. I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will change this harmful stance. I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible investigation of the facts related to the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and lawful manner participate. I look forward to speaking with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all. Edward Snowden witnessed by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer "The building is in good hands," says Michael Maier, Mayor of Winterlingen. The municipality sold the former kindergarten on Gartenstrasse to a private individual. The municipal council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part. The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price. "The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier. The budget was €100,000. It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten. The mayor is fine that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk. "This effort is gone now," says Maier happily.
Open-air concert in midsummer temperatures The Hammereisenbach music club gives an open-air concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer. When conductor Bianca Willmann lifted the baton at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still showed 25 degrees. About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians. Chairwoman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music. In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully overcome the first musician's hiccup.
What happens to my e-mail on the way? E-mail actually means electronic letter. When designing the internet service e-mail, was the secrecy of letters technically implemented in a similar way to conventional mail? When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible. For this reason, the basic technical protocols have not been designed to create a stable foundation for correspondence that is safe to listen to. Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter. If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the two computers connected directly? In the first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to her service provider's e-mail server. For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google. This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses. On the route, the mail can run through a number of other servers on the Internet. Bennie can then call the content to his provider. Are conventional e-mails read along on their way through the web? Most e-mails are read several times by software robots en route. The sender's provider usually checks whether the e-mail contains malware as an attachment. A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems. In addition, the providers check whether it is annoying and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder. Do the robots have another task? With systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual advertising. If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming vacation trip, Google can show corresponding links to vacation offers. Do unknown people also read the e-mails? The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low. Theoretically, however, this is possible. In companies, administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail. Law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails. There are also possible illegal spying actions. Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read? With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted to prevent it from being read. With great technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify who communicated with whom. How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany? According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google only play a minor role in mailboxes that are mainly used privately. While Yahoo Mail's shares had recently fallen, Google's GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother buried in the woods and receives a pension When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg came up with a plan. He buried the dead woman in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance. According to police investigations, a 67-year-old from Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest in order to be able to continue to collect his pension and care allowance. First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he pocketed the money for more than a year and a half. Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday. Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt. The man was already suspected in May: At that time it was noticed that the mother, who was in need of care, no longer needed any medication. The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain. Because the officers found this strange, they continued to investigate. It came out that the two had lived in the same apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently taken care of them. The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother. An autopsy found no evidence of a felony, police said.
After six match days, TSV Morsum is still without a point in the handball association league. Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers' team is facing a derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first win last weekend. With this game the season starts anew for us. "I hope that we can finally clear our heads," Ehlers is cautiously optimistic. With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal. Like us, Daverden also relies on speed play. So we have to keep our error rate low. First and foremost, however, it is important to improve the coverage, which has recently left anything but a secure impression. Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn. The game was, of course, a house number. But that doesn't mean we're the favourites, because anything can happen in a derby. Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series. Jan-Malte Jodat will be absent. On the other hand, youngster Joost Windssss, who plays doubles for Bundesliga youth team HC Bremen, is making his season debut. Anyone who is not hot in a game like this should stay at home.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers recover a charred body The fire brigade had to move out in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening. A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night. The rescue workers recover a charred body from the house. Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts. A police spokesman in Bayreuth said it was still unclear whether it was a resident. There was a fire on the first floor of the house late Thursday evening. When firefighters arrived, flames were already shooting out of a window. The emergency services went into the apartment and found the body in a room. This and another room burned out completely. The entire ground floor was damaged. All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said. The building is no longer habitable. The exact cause of the fire was not immediately clear.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession. The reason for this is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 according to the current situation. The profession is very attractive for young people today and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service. It is attractive to be able to determine your own work and daily routine. With Burfien, the regional church has commissioned a full-time pastor for the first time to inspire young people to study theology. Fewer and fewer young people are currently deciding to study theology after graduating from high school. Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud". The job is characterized by great freedom and diversity. I am the master of my appointment calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me. Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors. They earned as much as teachers and could make a good living from it. Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a secure employer. That suits the young people of today, who are not only interested in a career, but in meaningful work. According to the state church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring every year. At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology studies begin their vicariate. In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz Mountains, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to fill vacancies in the future. Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology. The study of theology offers a broad education. You can even become President with it.
Before the district derby against Schalke, BVB supporters who had traveled with them with flares caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena. Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences. Before Friday's Bundesliga game against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - initially. It was unusual, almost spooky acoustics that the viewer was offered until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park. It was mainly the guest fans who could be heard singing. The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself as exceptionally quiet: no singing, no battle cries. The podium of the capo, who otherwise coordinates the cheering, remained vacant. And at the very front of the stands, a large flag with the inscription "Stadium ban section" was waving lonely. Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to step onto the field did there be brief cheering. When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but by no means everywhere. Nothing moved in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand. The fact that stadium announcer Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the past few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebratory mood. The capo did not climb onto his podium until five minutes before kick-off - and the tension that had been almost tangible until then erupted in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, asked about the mood in the stands in the stadium. As always, it was the south stand's turn - and finally, as usual, this was the loudest place in the stadium. And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came from the south stand at the start, everything was back to normal. The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days. Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters who had traveled with them fired flares into the stands and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. The game started late because of the chaotic scenes. BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the top Dortmund ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives. "There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt. As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreographing the home game against VfB Stuttgart. "I banned that," he explained. We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy when it comes to pyrotechnics. In addition, the Ultras were shown various options for punishment - they now have until Tuesday to decide on one. Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week. "It will be drastic," assured Watzke. It will be interesting to see how the reactions in the south stand turn out.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help Secret service investigator Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to solve the NSA spy affair, which is becoming more and more explosive. According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, member of the Greens in the Bundestag, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former secret service employee would testify to a German public prosecutor or to an investigative committee. Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location. The general economic data is right and the financing options are excellent. This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung. The German real estate markets are benefiting from the country's economic strength and the country's good general economic conditions compared to other European countries. This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa at Jones Lang LaSalle, at the 9th Immobilientag of the Börsen-Zeitung. According to Ulbrich, a look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is. In the first three quarters of this year, it gained 31% compared to the same period last year. In Great Britain the plus was only 6%, in France 19%. "Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich. The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are planning to go their separate ways. However, in an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other. Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn. Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his split from his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr. In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope." Kerr and he still love each other, the 36-year-old emphasized. "We will support and love each other as parents to Flynn." Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to encyclopedias, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but differs from it in very significant ways. Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a hearty Edam cheese, these delicacies are not on the vegan menu. Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to not eating meat and fish, vegans refrain from consuming all animal products - honey is also denied. One might ask what remains, but on closer inspection the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a remarkable wealth of ideas. "Spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which stocks a variety of special products for vegans. Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop on Domgasse. The native New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he can find (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian". Then, around the turn of the century, I took the next step and became a vegan. "The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather. He realized that other everyday things could also be done without animal products. First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic. "I don't want animals to have to die for me," says Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior. Instead of mourning for burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm grew. "It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, being vegan isn't a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, it's an enrichment." Proctor attributes the assumption that changing one's diet reduces one's choice of dining options more to the power of habit. And it is precisely these conditions that make many attempts, no matter how well intentioned, fail. "The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many people give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor draws up a comparison. And objects: "Certain tastes cannot be pinned down to animals". It's often the spices or the way it's prepared that creates the taste. "But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan. For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue. He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, which should also taste hearty at times. Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate. "It should taste good, but that's not just limited to animal food," says Proctor. He did not suffer any damage to his health, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption. For me, the change had a positive aspect. I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content. There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan. "My blood counts are great, I get checked often," reveals Proctor. Many critics of veganism warn in particular about the lack of vitamin B12. "Because animals are fed on feed rather than grazing, it's questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer is high in vitamin B12," says Proctor. Vegans also have the option of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets. "My B12 levels are fine," he explains. Proctor doesn't have to go far to get food. After all, staple foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products. I can find everything I need on site. Every now and then I buy something special. "A lot of people overlook the fact that only the ready-made products are expensive, but that's how it is with 'ordinary' ready-made products as we know." In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed. "There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and a few little tweaks can produce good, if not better, results," says Proctor. Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws with his vegan cheesecake. The vegan gives family celebrations a new flavor. It's dynamic, when you cook together it has a new meaning. "The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor. Of course, he was also met with skepticism. Don't you like my food anymore? "Am I supposed to feel bad now for drinking milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with tact. "I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to live in an enclave. And when you look at it more closely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan-alien as you might think - and vegans aren't as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed. Fast food is also allowed. There are fries everywhere! "Many kebab shops offer falafel or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor. In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit. The restaurants are slowly adapting to this. "When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can spot a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it". "If there's enough demand, they might be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes. Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei. Proctor would like other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on their menu. Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone. Anyone can eat them, so they're the opposite of exclusive. "Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," notes Proctor. "If you want to avoid food scares, veganism is a surefire way to make most of it impossible in the first place," says Proctor. Buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first. Especially when you learn to understand that peanuts can also contain animal additives as coloring agents, following the ethics seems to quickly give you courage in the face of so many hurdles and traps. That's not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products. "Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble," Proctor knows. Veganism, it's an important moral pointer, the hits consciousness, it may not quite break habits, but at least it can teach consumers to question their habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in suspense. Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time. In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems. The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued trading unhindered. The latest incident continues a series of minor and major glitches at the stock exchange operator. Only on Tuesday were the Nasdaq indices not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport. In August of this year there were two breakdowns in just one week. First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent masses of erroneous buy orders to the options markets due to technical problems. As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and cancel them. Two days later, half of all stock trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer glitch on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Facebook's IPO last year also caused a stir. The SEC later found that the Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, and fined the company a record $10 million.
Konstanz: Cyclist drives 63-year-olds According to the police, the accident happened when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a women's bike illegally on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of the market place. When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped from a bar onto the sidewalk, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to the police. In the ensuing collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, fell to the ground and suffered a laceration of around 15 centimeters on his head. An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
Painted the construction site fence on the Bechtle property A group from the "Schweizer Wiese" citizens' initiative has beautified the construction site fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb. She also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release. The planned covering of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the area is in danger of slipping. Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, discussed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI. A banner with the message "We are in favor" was put up before the BI action. However, that didn't bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their campaign. Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins". She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project fail one day. In conversations with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the city's project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimensions of the project presented as BI. But they are beginning to give up because the city is still delaying these answers, the BI says. As has been heard, the mayor's public statements are also having an effect. May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal baths if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the referendum. Some appear to be downright frightened because of this, while others see it as a "blatant attempt at blackmail" on the population, the BI press release continues. The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Rangnick scolding referees: Mane not the king of swallows As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was just as disappointed with the referees. "There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of kings of swallows," he defended the two offensive whirlwinds at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday. The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was a yellow card for Mane in the 3-0 win against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was doomed by an alleged act - which of course wasn't, as the TV pictures showed. "A blatant wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described the referee as "completely overwhelmed" Harkam. Harkam also "played his part" in the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game. He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation". Schmidt himself claims he had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter. I don't know why. "Because I'm the one who was insulted," emphasized the 46-year-old. In view of the successful run, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise. "There are only two words for that: Really good," he stated. There isn't much to complain about. The way the team plays is particularly impressive. It should go on like this. There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer period. There are no great reasons to change anything. "Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors The inhabitants of a small Norwegian town have brought light into their gloomy valley with giant mirrors. Due to the low level of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring. With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday. "Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2. Some valley dwellers pulled out sun loungers, others put on sunglasses to be on the safe side. Until now, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter. Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed using mirrors to direct the rays down into the valley. This basic idea had existed in the village since 1913. After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million crowns (around 615,000 euros). A similar construction has been bringing winter sunshine to the Italian alpine town of Viganella for a number of years.
Post rarely empties on Sundays "Many citizens will not have noticed that the red dots for Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes in the city center and in the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow Post AG containers, you will quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and public holidays no longer takes place", the FDP announced. A request from the FDP confirmed this. On Sundays and public holidays, the only emptying is in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Strasse 36 and Jakob-Müller-Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld. The response to the FDP's request does not answer whether Hofheim and Rosengarten are still emptied on Sundays. The social and youth policy spokesman for the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to follow up on this. Sunday collection is an important postal service, especially for scheduled mail. "Despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, this company is radically and unreasonably thinning out". Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal parliamentary group and city association, supports his fellow parliamentarians: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being secretly changed or even canceled." The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens. "At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck in unison. The same applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens must be able to walk to a mailbox that is emptied on Sundays. Rohrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the post office about this matter. Mayor Erich Maier replied that Post had not communicated with Lampertheim. As far as he knows, there is also a Sunday collection in Hofheim. Your party spoke out in favor of privatization. "Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees are set to rise sharply Parking in Frankfurt could soon become noticeably more expensive. This morning, the city magistrate is discussing a proposal from Traffic Director Stefan Majer (Greens). Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent. However, the prices should not be raised for this, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes. The City Council still has to make a decision in December. The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea". The parking space directly in front of the shop is "an advantage for smaller specialist dealers that should not be underestimated". The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue". Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Rapid action overwhelms the hosts The men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to play against TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen with a small squad. The Älbler were with an experienced team on the other side of the net. However, it soon became apparent that, also due to their age, they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt team. With the hard and placed serves, the Gönningen found it extremely difficult. They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played cleanly through the middle of the net by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not there to defend against the block. Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects. In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat laxly and listlessly to make it 3-0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22). On November 2nd, there will be a much more powerful opponent in the form of TV Baiersbronn, who clearly prevailed in Nagold. TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz. In the B class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn. They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match. Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and point gifts, especially when receiving the ball; Even with the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the view for possible point gains. In this match, which was very balanced in terms of performance, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team showed great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment from both teams.
Care day at the small Englishman's hut A group of committed participants met at the small Englishman's hut in Ibach for what is now the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project in the upper Hotzenwald. Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be cut out that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser. According to Kaiser, many hikers describe this area as the highlight of the gorge trail, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views. He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the care day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between people and nature. It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature. At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect can also be taken into account. Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Regional Council explained this ecological aspect after the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the campaign every success. According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the goal of preserving the old Allmendweidfeld field, which has meanwhile become very overgrown, with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures. Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot cross barriers in the form of forest areas. You need these free links for conservation. Tribukait said she didn't want to miss the opportunity to take a stand for the planned biosphere reserve. The current measure not only fits seamlessly into this planning. A biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future. After these various explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups. The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the forest tractor was available if necessary. A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar. The goal was a clear view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens' policies, as well as its own public utilities can be described as an attractive city, has so far No second mayoral candidate announced yet. The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen. The application deadline is Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Falkenberger discotheque provides two great evenings The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.

Worker fell from a ladder: seriously injured When replacing a defective outside sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and was seriously injured. The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside of an inn. As he climbed onto the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped and the man fell to the concrete floor. He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by the "Christophorus 6" rescue helicopter.
Rapist in South Africa: two life sentences Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday. This was reported by the broadcaster SABC. The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries. Johannes Kana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week. The act sparked national outrage. The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town. Doctors fought for the victim's survival for 14 hours, but in vain. The sight of the youth was so horrific that the orderlies and nurses needed psychological support. Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime. He also confessed to hitting and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death. The police had initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because there was insufficient evidence against them. The public prosecutor's office also emphasized during the proceedings that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack. Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are around 64,000 reports of sexual violence every year. That is almost ten times as many as in Germany, which, with 82 million people, has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million). Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV show "Galileo". The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbo fattening is not a good prerequisite. So can ham that you can get in any supermarket be a quality product? Uli, the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the "Adler" company in Bonndorf works. "Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham. He only gets inside the factory wearing a hair protector and a smock. Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can pick up the microphone. Jumbo sighted for refreshment at a fast food restaurant in Waldshut "I work in huge quantities here," marvel the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product. 16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves. Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important when it comes to quality. Most pigs are slaughtered at six months. TV with class? Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role. The darker the meat, the higher the pH value. "I'm curious what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco," said Jumbo cynically. Here the level of private television is presented in its purest form. But still worth watching. The viewer sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still manual work. Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found boneless on the shelf. The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt. Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine". The trick: fir branches in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham. 20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black. "Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test meal. "It's really delicious," is the conclusion of the TV star. Everyone involved can live with that.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes tempt The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors are presented by the district association performance show this weekend in the community center. The evaluations were already made on Thursday. Once again, the local association W514 is organizing this large exhibition. Breeders from the clubs in the Soest district show their best animals here, as do young Wicked hobby keepers their rabbits. On Thursday, six judges assessed the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals. Visitors to the show are well informed, since the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages. Mayor Hermann Arndt will officially open the exhibition at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday. The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony. Guests are also invited to a raffle with handsome prizes and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum The next ecumenical discussion forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Palace will deal with the topic "To hell with hell - theological reflections on how to deal with the last things today". The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner. The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Lake Constance Cultural Office. In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to pursue the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death. If people in past centuries had known too much about this and had relied on those images of heaven and hell "that shape our ideas to this day", contemporary prophetic teaching about hopes for completion is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness. "The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by the criticism of religion," says the speaker. She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks". Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death". This is linked to the question of that longing "that dreams of everything being good in the end". Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg from 1982 to 1989. She received her PhD in 1997. theol., also in Freiburg. The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität. Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their faith during confirmation. 101 15- and 16-year-old young people from the Am Kleinen Heuberg pastoral care unit were confirmed in two services. The group Laudato-Si accompanied the service in the morning and the youth choir The Spirit in the afternoon. By receiving the sacrament of confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit. In the past few months, the confirmands had prepared for the big feast day under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners. In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: second mountain bike race enthuses participants 214 cyclists came to Illmensee in glorious weather to complete the circuit over the chain of hills around the lake. This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee. Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, were numerous amateur cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere. Two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German Championships. As expected, these two were able to pull away from the field. As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance. Pascal Treubel was again able to place second. For the women, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium. Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leoniedriver from Owingen took second and third place. One encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community. The entire range of athletes was represented, and not just in terms of performance. The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest starters. In the main race this year even more absolute top athletes were at the start. Four drivers were able to break away from the regional top drivers. Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing Team. Together with a team colleague, Pangerl has twice been world champion in twelve-hour driving. This year he became European Champion in this special discipline. Also present was Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon. After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude difference, the finish line in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle came in a blink of an eye. Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line. Just a second behind, the experienced Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings. At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall. In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race. Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart. Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Excellent mastery of the fight The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is tailor-made for Horst Janson. Janson himself is an old hand in his profession, the art of acting. No one can fool the old man Santiago when it comes to fishing. The two just complement each other perfectly. You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the old man's neck that the fisher boy Manolo is talking about. When Santiago sits hunched over his chair, tired from life, it's real with Janson. In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a character role through and through, which Janson masters excellently. Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower. Janson is largely the sole actor on stage. He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologues are never boring. His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is all water bottles lit up in blue after all. Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village. In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings about the Cuban way of life with her songs and her wonderful voice. The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans A sewage canal from Roman times has been preserved below Cologne over a length of around 120 metres. If you visit Cologne, you cannot avoid the cathedral. The two towers rise around 157 meters into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe. But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral. Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld. The meeting point for his guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Center right next to the cathedral. The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze. In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, so only what was left of the old city wall was left that wasn't too big. Most users of the multi-storey car park therefore hurry past the Roman remains and just park their cars. But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in parking deck D2. You can see ruins about five meters high made of palm-sized stones. "These are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze. Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft. This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed. The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, and this is where the participants descend again into the depths. Here we experience the official residence of what was once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA. A visitor wants to know what CCAA means. "The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in plain German means something like "City under Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult". And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine. From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of around 120 meters. "You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests. Schulze still has a surprise. After fetching the key from the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, accessible shaft. "We are now in the mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains. The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater that was essential for the ritual ablutions. To this day, different water levels can be read at the lower end of the mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, due to the changing levels of the Rhine. The mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone in the town hall square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly. However, it will still be a few years before it is completed.
Leg almost chopped off: relaunch of rocker process A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years. A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily harm and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun in the Frankfurt (Oder) district court. He is accompanied by strict security measures. The defendants were initially silent. They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the Bandidos at the time. The public prosecutor accuses them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices. All victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg. The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group. One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin. Apparently, there was a chase with several cars. According to the indictment, it was about turf wars and a demonstration of power. The two accused were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012. A court spokesman said at the time it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud. The perpetrators wore masks and were not recognized. The Federal Court of Justice reversed the verdict after the public prosecutor's office appealed and referred it back to the district court for a new hearing. One of the defendants is currently in prison for another crime. At the start, the main focus was on reconstructing what happened on the night of the crime. The commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited as a witness. The focus was on cell phone conversations between the accused and other people that the police had listened to. What is difficult is that rockers almost always adhere to a law that is iron for them in court - and do not testify. This also applies to the victims. In the first trial, only one of the victims unpacked. When asked, public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said that new evidence had emerged since the last trial. Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The throwaway society doesn't think The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point we have to go home. Only: Hunger is noticeable in the bellies of the people in the front passenger and back seats. Sure, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this! What could be more chilled than driving to the nearest drive-in to treat yourself to a little something? I admit that I like to be there when it comes to getting fast food late at night or early in the morning. A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then off to bed and home! But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become apparent. Because what's missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?! Discarded paper bags lie on the roadside and in parking lots, especially at weekends. "Why?" I ask myself. Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next garbage can? It's not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape. Bags have also covered traffic facilities such as crash barriers, causing accidents. But the said "throwaway society" doesn't think about something like that, they probably don't even know what this word actually means. If you are often out and about in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothes, bottles and other rubbish pile up there. A few more bags wouldn't make any difference - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on other people's leftovers. I can already see the day coming when the cities and communities will get bored with clearing away - and the fast food chains will have to charge a deposit for their bags.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base A US government official who wished to remain anonymous told American news channel CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air force base in Syria's Latakia the day before. The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN. Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled in the night from Wednesday to Thursday and blamed the Israelis for it. Israeli TV Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Neva anti-aircraft missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 says have a range of 35 kilometers and warheads up to 70 kilograms can transport. Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack. However, the Reuters news agency quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack but was not certain. In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports." The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously tried, sometimes successfully, to supply Hezbollah with surface-to-air missiles. The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" that would be followed by a military response.
A stubborn ankle injury threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in FSV Mainz 05's Bundesliga away game at FC Augsburg. Mainz is struggling to get Nicolai Müller to play. Tomorrow he will try to train with the team. So far he could only do that individually. "We will decide on his assignment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel. The 40-year-old is hoping to have his top scorer with six goals with him. Because the Mainz team already have to do without the injured top performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
