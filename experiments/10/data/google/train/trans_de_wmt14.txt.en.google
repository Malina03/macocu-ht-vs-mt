A black box in the car? US road planners are looking for a source of cash to repair the deteriorating highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits on every car's dashboard. The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning bureaus to overhaul the outdated system of funding US roads. The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances. Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are arguing that the government should be able to use the small boxes to record miles driven - and possibly where driven - and then use the information to calculate tax returns. The Tea Party is horrified. The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has raised a number of privacy concerns. But while Congress can't agree on a course of action, several states aren't waiting any longer. They are currently studying how they can move to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years. Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring. This is really a must for our country. "It's not something that we will possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California motorists in the state by 2025. The way we pay these taxes will change. The technology is there. The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke. But in America people don't fill up as much as they used to. Cars use less petrol. The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) has not increased in 20 years. When fuel prices are high, politicians don't dare raise the tax by even one cent. "The gas tax just isn't sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation law expert at the University of Minnesota. His state recently fitted 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system. "It represents the most sensible long-term alternative," he said. Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee. Unsurprisingly, the idea has caught on with urban liberals, as the tax could be used to influence driving behavior to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions, for example. California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to meet the state's ambitious statutory climate change goals. But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative. The independent marketers at the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers pay based on the distance they have traveled. "This isn't a black hole tax," explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason. People pay directly for what they get. The movement is also backed by two former US Secretary of Transportation, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move toward mileage-based billing. The US Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars. But a majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers who represent people who often have to travel long distances to get to work or into town on a daily basis. Several states and major cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own. The most dedicated is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment. These drivers will soon be paying the mileage fee to the state instead of the fuel tax. Nevada has already completed a pilot project. New York City is also considering one. Illinois is testing it with trucks on a limited basis. And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how to introduce the change. The concept is not a universal hit. In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices, drivers were wary of the government tracking their every move. "Big Brother concerns and things like that were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. People didn't want it. As the test began, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices." There was no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals. Nevada is among a number of states that are now looking to affordable technology that would allow the state to track mileage, but not exactly when and where. With that, according to Khan, the public would also be more reassured. The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup in California called True Mileage. The company didn't originally start out to help states tax drivers. Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for auto insurance that requires drivers to pay based on miles driven. However, the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem. "People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations aren't recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage. Big mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs. There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this. In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a variety of choices. You can opt for a device with or without GPS. Or they choose not to use any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents in the state. Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by adding more features to the devices rather than fewer. In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that will also pay for parking, pay for mileage-only insurance, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles to help drivers avoid traffic jams. "Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," according to a city planning document. Some transportation planners, however, are wondering if all the talk about paying per mile is just a huge red herring. Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes. An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid or other fuel-efficient vehicles so that they too pay their fair share. "There's no need for surgery when an aspirin will do," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's head of legislation and public affairs. When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany over US surveillance Edward Snowden, the US Secret Service's whistleblower, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, provide no responses about their activities. German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss testimony in Germany. In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: "Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political expression with the threat of punishment , where no defense is possible.” But telling the truth is not a crime. In the letter, Snowden writes that he believes the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop the charges against him. The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property. German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, then we will find ways to make that possible." US-German relations have been strained by claims that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Thomas Oppermann, the MP who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee, said the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness if possible "without endangering him and completely wrecking relations with the US". Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed. He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia. Ströbele explained that if Snowden leaves the country, according to former NSA employee Snowden's lawyer, he cannot return to Russia. If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs assurances that he is "safe" there, the MP said. Snowden says in his letter that he faces a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that has driven him from his homeland. However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression". Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians - including in the United States - have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of extensive surveillance a public service. In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines Charges for Carry-on Bags Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who wish to stow carry-on bags on their flight. Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, though Wednesday's announcement said passengers could keep the whole can. The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead bin, small bags under the seat are still free. Frontier said it charges $25 if the fee is prepaid and $100 for travelers who pay at the gate. Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at encouraging travelers to arrange payment upfront. "We don't want to calculate that amount," she explained. Airlines began charging first and second checked bags in 2008. Passengers trying to avoid these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their carry-on luggage, with the result that the overhead bins are often overcrowded. Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board. O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money. It is about Frontier's most loyal customers, who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat. Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay. This means that a passenger at the Frontier gate may be allowed one bag for free, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable bag. O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are changing so that passengers are aware of the fee before they get to the gate. Frontier's new carry-on fee will not come into effect until the summer, and there is no exact date yet. Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to resort to them. They argue that luggage transport costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it. Many on Wall Street are taking the new bag fees as a sign that airlines are making enough money to pay for air travel after years of losses. So far, however, most have avoided hand luggage fees. Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge carry-on bags three years ago, followed later by Allegiant Air, another low-cost airline. The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the surcharge. He estimated in a December 2011 report that the carry-on fee brings in $50 million annually for Spirit. Sorensen, who previously held an executive position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew Spirit and was curious what to expect at the gate when passengers were confronted with the company's unusual carry-on fee. "The boarding process was among the smoothest I've experienced in my aviation career," he said. I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical arguments at the gate. "The plane was full," he explained, "and boarding was smooth sailing." Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 they charge for coffee, tea, soda or juice. The company said passengers who bought soda or juice could keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free. Water is still free. US Airways briefly tried charging for soft drinks in 2008, but backed out seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit. Frontier's move to charge carry-on bags if passengers don't buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at driving customers to its website. Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold. This gives all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency. Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though. In September, the company began awarding half the frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency. On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route. A 1,000-mile Frontier flight booked with a third-party provider will therefore only earn customers 250 miles. Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively through direct purchase on the Frontier website. Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money. Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday. Republic has tried to get a handle on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
NSA says website crash is due to 'internal error', not hackers The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error shut down its public website for several hours, not hackers, as claimed online. "NSA.gov was down for several hours last night due to an internal error during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement. The problem will be fixed this evening. The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true. In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and some users still haven't. Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised. Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said. At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have taken down the NSA website with a DDoS attack. In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes. The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network. The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has now found itself in the limelight and has faced harsh criticism at home and abroad following revelations over the past few months about its extensive surveillance program - a result of classified NSA data stolen and released by disaffected former NSA operative Edward Snowden. The growing controversy surrounding the agency fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier slumps profits after falling deliveries and orders Canadian aircraft and trainmaker Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent drop in net profit after being pressured by slower third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries and contract problems at its train division. Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft, or provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use next September, according to its ambitious schedule. The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has only been followed by three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will go as planned. The results fell short of forecasts and caused the Toronto Stock Exchange to fall more than 8 percent. Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to sector perform from outperform on Thursday, citing the stock has limited upside potential over the next quarter to two. "Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter. We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft's testing program progresses. However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program. Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus. The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and first flew in September after months of delays. But so far firm orders for the CSeries are modest at 177 as potential buyers await the results of flight tests and see if the company's claims of the new jet airliner's fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential are accurate. There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies. CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 firm orders by the time the jet enters commercial service. Management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule. "The test aircraft was grounded no longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's downtime. Every manufacturer plans differently. We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did. This happens throughout the flight program. The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly thereafter, the company said. Still, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to put a CSeries aircraft into service. Bombardier said it is reviewing the Plan for Entry into Service (EIS) and will update it over the coming months. "The slow progress of the flight tests - although they appear to be in line with Bombardier's internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen. For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents. Sales dipped slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year. Net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83. Aerospace backlog was $32.9 billion at September 30, flat from December 31. "Aerospace results were within our guidance, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin. Aerospace sales fell 13 percent to $2 billion. Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, announced that sales in this division rose by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion. Transportation backlog was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31. Transportation margins were impacted by execution issues on some large contracts. According to company management, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter. In Thursday afternoon trading, Bombardier's shares fell 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the board. Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addict lawyer who warned drug lord of police investigation faces jail Basharat Ditta, 42, leaked information to underworld giant Neil Scarborough The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court A well-known man Defense attorney who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison. Basharat Ditta, 42, provided crime lord Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction. Hailed by criminalists as "top notch", the lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case. Officials observed Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the barrister's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues. The investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards. Over a period of eight months, between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates. All four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire. They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches. Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would become public. Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court today after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced. He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier interview. The lawyer was convicted after police investigations into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011. Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and place the 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the attorney's garbage can. Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium for dinner. The attorney returned home, retrieved the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two. It was revealed in court that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards. Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claiming their discussion was covered by "attorney-client privilege". During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and attempted to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken. When questioned by the police, he stated that he had an office at both his home and work address and that clients called him at home for legal matters. It was revealed in court that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and shared what investigators knew about them. Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone not to break the law." Ditta faces charges of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney for becoming overly involved with certain clients. The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying drugs to his lawyer. Some of what he said was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the attorney for those people. But this went well beyond the bounds of a normal attorney-client relationship. He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities. Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute. He was too close to certain clients, notably Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised. Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I wanted to give information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately." But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee said Halstead, of Lancashire Police, said: "Mr Ditta made the transition from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals." His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives leading members of organized crime who hired him to collect valuable information about police investigations. Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and inspire trust and confidence in the public. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession. Lancashire's Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta which also resulted in a conviction on three counts of cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, underscoring our determination to bring criminals to justice. This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law. We'll find you and bring you to justice. Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Thirty-five other drug traffickers were sentenced to total terms of 153 years for drug offenses. On his website, Ditta posted a Q&A section about himself, stating that his dream job is to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his ultimate dinner guest is Mohammed Ali, and that inequality is the motivation behind his Work.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law "We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: What is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" read the newspaper, which considers the draft law unconstitutional . "The law is draconian and very punitive and we oppose it," said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites. He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy. "I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said. According to The Star newspaper, the government's new law is "effectively putting a stranglehold on the media". In contrast, The Standard writes that democracy and free speech in Kenya have "taken a serious blow" and called the draft "draconian". The law's passage is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September. The Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities by releasing security camera footage of officers dispatched to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury mall. Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a senior media figure for questioning, although the subpoena was withdrawn after media outcry. Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to 1 million, with the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being barred from official press accreditation. The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a fine is not paid. According to the Daily Nation, "a single fine can bankrupt most radio stations." The newspaper also believes these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere." By silencing the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity. "Nobody will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life. "Left to their own devices, politicians will bankrupt the country and take us back to the hunter-gatherer days," he commented. Kenyan lawmakers have drawn public anger in the past. In May they voted to reverse cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their hefty, tax-free salaries of about ATS 532,000 per month – among the highest in the world.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Goals The United Nations is now beginning work on a set of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction announced 12 years ago. Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro that evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015. They were included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests". "I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal, sustainable development goals," he said. “These goals will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework. I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Goals.”
Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential figures Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founder and first President, to sing calls for peace in a rare public demonstration. "We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company. Fearing for the country's future, she swapped her business attire for a T-shirt that read "We Demand Security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday. For the last two weeks there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo on an almost daily basis, in what are considered among the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago. Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government. It became an opposition party after the 1992 peace treaty. Analysts say the country is unlikely to slip back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals alike. The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast offshore gas deposits and coal deposits in the Northwest could see investments in excess of $50 billion over the next few years from the likes of Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and Bringing Anadarko into the country from the USA. The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions. Renamo claims the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17. Attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times. The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers. President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability. He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining strength to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government". Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war. But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord. He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement. "Our vision is to resume negotiations and do it in earnest," Mazanga said. Previous talks between the parties have done little to settle tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year. "We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a senior lecturer at the Open University and a Mozambique expert. None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions. Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott November's municipal elections. Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year. Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to secure concessions and financial favors from the government. Renamo's electoral record has dwindled since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to do better in the elections. Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy. "He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said. It's unclear what Renamo's capabilities are, but they have launched disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south route. Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo but is home to Beira, the port used by mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal. In June, Rio suspended use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line. Mazanga was reticent when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat. Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said. The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people were already concerned about corruption, slow development progress and a recent wave of kidnappings. "People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains. Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just want stability. "No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
According to one author, children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life". The stories of Thor show that "brutal strength stands no chance against clever tricks" and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream. However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works. "I think it's wonderful that in America, myth and folklore are already part of education," he said. I've been proposing this as a plan for twenty years. He added that children "turn off completely" with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic" because entertaining stories convey the messages "subliminally." Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "One can have certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background if possible." Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to instill hope. Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy endings, but there is an inherent sense of good and bad. This must be subliminal, revealed through the story and not explained. That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as an emcee at the Palace Theater on Broadway worked on telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation. Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival. Initiated and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres. "Most of these headliners started out with Carolines and then went from strength to strength until they were too well known to perform in a club," Hirsch said. We conceived this festival so that we can continue to work with them. This year's event features performances from Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy fundraiser for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform. The world of comedy has grown with the festival. A number of the comedians taking part in this year's festival have gained notoriety through more unconventional channels, such as showings on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike. Nick Kroll rose to fame with a cable TV sitcom (the tongue-in-cheek fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central. Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. Both Kroll and Slate and other distinctively voiced young comedians (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the tongue-in-cheek, racially-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy. One of the biggest visitor magnets at the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David. Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian but has grown into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian. From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land. The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan. "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said. He told me that when he's here he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks to himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I'll live here.
Oil prices fall further to $96 a barrel Oil prices fell further on Friday after concerns over high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing. The benchmark crude for December deliveries was down 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange late this morning in Europe. The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, meaning the price fell 5.8 percent in October. The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks. The US Department of Energy said Wednesday US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week. Over the course of five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels. But on Friday there were signs of stronger demand with two reports of picking up activity in Chinese manufacturing. This points to a continued recovery in China's economy, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after hitting a two-decade low in the previous quarter. Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday blocked an order by a judge calling for changes to the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk program to and released the judge from the case. The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be stayed pending a decision on the city's appeal. The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution by the way it implemented the program for stopping and questioning people. The city appealed its assessment and the corrective actions it ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring agency to assist police in changing their policy and related training program. The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension requested on Tuesday. The appeals report stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges, which stipulates that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was justified in part by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court's criticisms. The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by improperly targeting black and Hispanic men with the stop-and-frisk program. It appointed an outside agency to oversee the implementation of major changes, including policy, training and oversight reforms, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most inspections were conducted. In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people released after a police stop. A hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014. The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates. Stops of this type have existed in various forms for decades, but during the non-party Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure, the number of stops recorded rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic men. In 2004, four men, all from minorities, filed a lawsuit that grew into a class action lawsuit. Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as impact how other police departments implement the rule. Opponents say the changes will dampen police morale but not crime; it would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost over the past decade. The judge noted that she is not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but is only reforming the way the NYPD enforces the controls.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "handsome special adviser" Hannah Pawlby. The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and followed her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court learned. "According to prosecutors, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside people's homes hoping to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction ' Edis explained. He said NotW uses three techniques to investigatively research stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation. The editor is personally involved in the third method. Obviously he knows about the second one, the surveillance, it can't be any other way. How about the first? Does he know about the phone hacking? He denies it, but we say, "And did he know about it." Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW's features editors, when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Waste it not your time, she's dating Charles.” A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was recovered from Mulcaire's home in August 2006. Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects." While the investigation was being conducted, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained. Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Pawlby's movements. On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail stating, "I have a story we're coming up with tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about." Edis explained that Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as others important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett. The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married. Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006. Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
NSA revelations fuel corporate paranoia over government surveillance On a balmy day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital. On orders from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), Germany's domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank. According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US should not use foreign espionage avenues “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or profits But since whistleblower-turned-employee Edward Snowden began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate bosses have been unsure whether to take the director at his word. Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have sent corporate paranoia over government surveillance to a new high. The final straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for a decade. If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate executives are certainly potential targets as well. Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent. I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit. "Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany. German companies believe the US now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consultancy firm EY. In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence that the US had passed trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies. Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US. Companies are skeptical about this. It was suggested in the Bundestag that we should set up a German Google. I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again... "It doesn't work that way," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP. If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago. Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture. Everything except the IT industry. Still, the reach and sophistication of US espionage agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations has shocked companies that previously saw the greatest espionage risk in China. A major shift is taking place in cloud computing as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk. According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, about 10 percent of non-US members dropped plans to use a US provider after the revelations about US data mining activities using Prism. Jim Snabe, executive vice president of SAP, says, "We're seeing a new question from customers that wasn't there a year ago - it's where is my data stored and can you guarantee it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?" Many German business leaders believe the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore protect them at all costs. It is no surprise that industrial espionage is taking place. It has always been like this. "It was an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF. The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, as do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies. Corporate leadership usually doesn't brag about the countermeasures they've taken because it gives attackers an advantage. In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick with you to a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least. Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at automaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect cell phones before board meetings so they cannot be used as listening devices. The German BVT advises executives to use basic prepaid cell phones when traveling abroad because smartphones can potentially be compromised. The prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards. However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance. In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche. "Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, the personnel and the financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," warns the BVT in a report. The USA warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries. According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel as the second countries after China to use hacking to obtain economic data. A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to industrial espionage, "the French are the worst." Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's interior intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted as saying in an interview this month: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Parents of Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe murder Thursday. Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, USA, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the stands in the school gym. Lowndes County Sheriff's Investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts that. "They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's attorney, told FoxNews.com. They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded. "They think it's totally illogical, against the laws of physics as well as against common sense," Crump said. Rather, they believe the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death. "Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he comments. US Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death because a number of important issues remained unresolved. What was the cause of death? Was his death due to a crime? Moore said so at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. I follow the facts, whichever way they lead. My goal is to find out the truth. "I believe there is sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said. Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation." However, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, Moore said. "There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said. Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will have the FBI conduct the investigation. A representative from the county sheriff's office was not immediately available to comment on our request Thursday. A southern Georgia court on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed. The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage held clues as to how he died.
CDC Releases School Allergy Guidelines On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for managing children's food allergies in schools. These are the first such guidelines the US government has issued, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing. One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy. The prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC. The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies and how to manage children who have allergic reactions. It is also recommended that schools stock epinephrine - the EpiPen brand auto-injector is the most commonly used - to counteract a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction. State legislatures recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine. Also included in the report is a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction. Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like there's a hair on it," or "My tongue tingles."
Parents of Intersex Children Can Choose Gender Undetermined Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia. Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female. Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare the gender of such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate. The aim of the law is to relieve pressure on parents to avoid making hasty decisions about newborn sex assignment surgeries and to combat discrimination against intersex people. An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC: "I am neither male nor female." I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mangled and scarred. It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born neither a boy nor a girl each year. They belong to the intersex group, a group who fall under the diagnosis of "Sexual Differentiation Disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitalia. Wallis Simpson may have been intersex. Understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that if determination is not possible, one should use the best available information on gender assignment and not wait for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding - if at all - to have an operation. The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing". Intersex children present an ethical dilemma. "Some people have life-threatening medical conditions that require surgery, but most children don't," he said. One can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait and see how the identity develops. The scientific data on how a child develops their gender identity in the first place is not very accurate. Nobody knows why it happens. It's like the secret of why people are gay. A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not based on gender but on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them. These traits were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts, and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones. The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace and the extent of harassment, violence and bias-related crime. Gender mismatched boys now have a special camp. In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third gender" on official documents. In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court allowed lifelong retention of an "unspecified" gender status. In addition to M and W, German ID cards will in future have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior. In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news item on France 24. In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition demanding that "gender theory" be removed from school textbooks. US website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, citing: "When the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of Civilization.” The mother of a newborn Maryland told Baby Zone that she would prefer babies to be assigned a gender at birth. "Being a parent is stressful enough on its own, especially when you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parenting website. Children need stability and security. Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes. Just ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt. But now the ethics of surgery are being questioned, now that we know the complexities of gender identity and that doctors can be wrong because they don't know how the child will feel growing up with the gender they have assigned. "In the middle of the 20th century it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher. When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon. The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable. He coined the term "gender identity," arguing that social and environmental cues—how parents raise a child—interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether a person considers themselves male or female. But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial. He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl. "Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, but it wasn't," said Drescher. When the boy was about 15, he reverted to male gender and married a woman. At 38, however, he committed suicide. According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model. But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, survivors of these sex surgeries came out "not happy with the outcome." Take Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia. Doctors weren't sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he'd never be able to have a "satisfactory life" as a man. So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl. At the age of 12 he started receiving female hormones. "I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions. At the age of 18 he was due to have a vaginal plastic surgery. But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records. What he found was shocking. I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me that. Bruce was born with DSD which left his body unable to produce enough testosterone to develop genitals. After learning the truth, he reverted to male identity, receiving testosterone injections and having his breasts removed. The operation left him infertile. Today he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to ensure that intersex people are seen as normal. But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law may "encourage labeling and stigmatization." "Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an 'undetermined'," she explained. We fear this favors intervention. We think it would be better to assign male or female gender and then wait. But we don't yet know how the law will play out, so we can only speculate. Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender". "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained. The German law is about assignment at birth. This is not a fight to force young children into at this point. When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies. But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says German law "empowers" both parents and children. Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called Complete Androgen Resistance. Because of the testosterone receptor defect in target cells, Katie developed female characteristics. She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries. Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in child psychiatry. Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother. "The law gives parents leeway so they don't have to rush into making decisions," Baratz said. It buys them time to take various tests and sort things out, giving them time before writing "male" or "female." That way everything is fine - you raise the child and love him. You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of being a parent. And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone. "It includes the kids in the decision-making process and takes away the fear that parents have because they don't think they're doing the right thing," she said. Ultimately, the child decides which gender suits them better, and that's wonderful. This enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Report: Obama campaign mulls replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to the New York Times. The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012. The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to determine whether Obama's dwindling re-election hope would be better off if he ousted Biden let According to Jonathan Martin, the Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly chronicles the efforts of senior campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it is having on the poll numbers that swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President. The potential move was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office. Only a half-dozen of the president's closest aides -- including Daley, former Obama campaign director Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew about the proposed move. Double Down alleges that Daley spearheaded efforts to swap out Biden despite their "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move after data showed Clinton's candidacy "did the odds Obama's would not improve significantly." In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton. "I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and this was one of them," Daley told the magazine. You have to remember that the president had terrible poll numbers at the time, so we were like, "For God's sake, what are we doing?" While Daley called the investigations "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during considerable effort had been expended during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes. "Campaigns don't spend as much money on surveys and focus groups unless you're really thinking about something," explained Martin on AC360. However, it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange. Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential move. Although Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" Obama could have known about it. Martin added that "Double Down" does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the policy probings reached Obama's desk. Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election. "Possibly," Martin replied.
Fancy some glow-in-the-dark ice cream? A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish. Charlie Francis harnessed the fluorescent properties of sea creatures and turned them into a glowing treat. He got the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to synthesize the glowing protein. The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow. Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in your mouth and glows - so the more you lick it, the lighter it gets. Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "The product is amazing, but it's still very early in production, so you can get two grams of it for 200 pounds." The protein used in the ice cream co-reacts of the tongue at a neutral pH. As the mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice cream glows. We've been testing it for the last few months and we thought it would be ideal to launch on Halloween because it has this wonderful glow effect. It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, as the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold. Each bullet costs me about £140. But it tastes delicious. Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf. But his latest creation should be even more ambitious. He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream." That is inherently impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we'll find a way to make it work. The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially created by Chinese scientists
Halloween 2013: in numbers When I was little, there was something magical about Halloween. My sister and I got to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood. Today I've become more of a Halloween muffle. I have not agreed to give out candy from my home for the last two years and I probably won't do it this year either. But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween. The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be exact — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Association of Retailers (NRF). One thing I look forward to every Halloween is trending values. The costumes will account for about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to NRF. This year, slinky inanimate objects are all the rage. Women no longer have to dress up in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots. As far as men go, I'm expecting plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm betting the daft punk spacemen will be making the Instagram feeds this year. According to Google, the most searched costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Witches. I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition. Last year we dressed up our dogs and to my surprise we were not alone. In fact, Americans are spending $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to NRF. That's a lot of "hot dogs." When it comes to sweets, we're not squeamish. Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company. That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, sweets and gummy bears. So good news for the 41 million people trick-or-treating, according to the US Department of Commerce. In fact, we will be buying and, let's face it, eating over 100 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween. The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers. That's about nine billion kernels of corn. It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet. Nothing says Halloween like haunted houses. They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls (which is in a real jail, by the way), Howl-O-Scream, and The House of Shock. There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that gross $500 million, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you peeing your pants in the act and then posting your friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of it, and then the guy you fancy leaves you with a comment like "nice facial expression". But let's finally get to the pumpkins. Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o'-lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree—something we've done since we were little. Luckily, the baby in a pumpkin trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it. This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau. The jack-o'-lantern slowly rotting in the front yard is thought to have originated in Illinois, where 500 million pounds of pumpkins were harvested this year. If you want to score big, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 2,000-pound pumpkin.

Firefighters called to the rescue of a puppy stuck 15 meters off the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry Cocker spaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident Three days later she was spotted in her predicament by a walker in the quarry Firefighters roped up rock face and saved the dog from certain death The fire brigade managed to bring a little dog to safety that was stuck on a 15 meter high ledge in a rock face. Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived on her own for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday. Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and say thank you to firefighters from the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the minor traffic accident. Around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, a walker walking his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 50-foot (15-meter) ledge in the quarry. Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the scene and rappeled to the rescue of Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog crate. Technical rescue team specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position. She was in the middle of the cliff - 15 meters from the top and the bottom. She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen rigid. But now she's fine. She then ate some dog biscuits. That was quite an unusual mission. The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible. Peter Lau, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was extremely lucky." There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse. Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, who found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration. Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary." I couldn't believe she was actually up there. It was wonderful to hold her in my arms again. The vet explained that if the exhaustion got too much and she collapsed, she would probably have fallen. The firefighters did a great job. It was really brave what they did. We're just so grateful and every one of them has been absolutely amazing. Scott Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid it was going to fall but it stayed up." The firefighters were great. I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18. Speaking to Australian radio this week, the pop star said she worked as a backing vocalist on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard." Perry explained that she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that "he hit on me when I was 18". She added, "It's been a long time and he's been very nice to me." In a statement on Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies that he has ever made advances to Katy Perry." The rep added, "Maybe she mistook him for someone else." Perry was one of the singers who guest-starred on the Rolling Stones tour this year. Her new album "Prism" went straight to number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice Another day, another independence scare story. This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership. This provides the cue for tales of passport control at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall. Indeed, the Strathclyde bill did point to the potential economic benefits of being able to travel more freely across the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this didn't make the headlines. Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them. As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be just a small concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots. So actually no story. And one that has aged so much that it resembles a fossil: I first heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago. An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this age-old story. Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to European tunes? Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now? This is the real European news: the grand post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled. With the euro crisis, the European project officially died. All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to jettison the euro as a common currency are gaining ground. Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded just this year – garnered almost five million votes in September's general election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag. There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe. However, the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point. Because of the tough austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket that sticking to the common currency is forcing national economies into, many people believe the European project has gone too far. The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece. Instead, the Eurosystem has locked its members on exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way. Without the possibility of a local currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany. The only option is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin. Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem. As a result of Brussels-enacted "green" energy directives - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States. That's a crippling cost disadvantage, as we saw at Grangemouth. All the wage locks in the world do nothing to protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas. As a result, a revolt is brewing, particularly in France, once the EU's cheerleader. After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington. But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, with the ailing French economy struggling. The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a crucial by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place. The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote – a timely warning to Britain's Labor Party that it cannot assume a split on the right would automatically mean benefits to the left. What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among working-class white French? She wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament. If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – which is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time. This is my point: in the not too distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will converge towards the abolition of the euro. The EU will not go away, but it will become more like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored. Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick with the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies. I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in hopes of ingratiating itself with the US. However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain. Where is Scotland in all this? We can choose to be a region of (ultimately) Little England. Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what to put where. I suspect Scotland could fare quite well in a looser Europe as long as we keep our own currency. Cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of Nations. Otherwise, we should consider doing the same as Norway and keeping our economic independence. The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 by rejecting proposed (and implemented) cuts by Labor Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition were responsible for. It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows. Physical changes don't immediately mean puberty There's no evidence hormones or other chemicals are to blame Experts believe the obesity epidemic is a trigger of early puberty The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues. Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing breasts and pubic hair by the age of seven or eight? At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Fla., pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm. "I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- it's not usually a sign that puberty is approaching fast," Kaplowitz explained. Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, show up earlier in girls. However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (onset of the first menstrual period) over the past 40 years. In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970. "Once the breasts begin to develop, it's still at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also an author of the Buchs "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem". Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses. There is some debate as to what actually marks the onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight. In most cases, the process slows or stagnates—something a pediatrician can closely monitor. If it is progressing more quickly, testing by an endocrinologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts. There are treatments to delay early menstruation and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to stunted growth and short stature in adults. The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity. Psychosocial aspects are also important. Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he concedes, "Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavior problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers." The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don't want theirs very much young daughters who have periods. "They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they're handling the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said. "It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter started her period when she was ten. Even though there were early signs and we'd talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared. She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her group of friends. There are many well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty. But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal. Boys reach puberty earlier than girls. Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic. He helped conduct a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine linking body fat to puberty. Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors at play. In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers. There are different explanations for this. Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes. Another conundrum: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls. Other physicians at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue. The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers. "We have to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child. "That can mean having to have a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz advised. If you remain calm, the child usually responds well. Girls who bloom early need reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes sooner than expected.
Jumbo makers clash over seat width in the face of large orders A dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of economy class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month's Dubai Airshow. The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the ones airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space holds the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. Airbus this week called for an industry standard mandating a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but US arch-rival Boeing says that should be up to airlines to decide. The row comes as planemakers are vying to sell even larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine planes and expect record orders at the November 17-21 event. How the rear of the aircraft is designed - particularly whether there are nine or ten seat rows - is critical to the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is expected to deliver. Boeing claims its modernized "777X" will seat 406 people with economy-class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row. Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, with nine per row. Aircraft giants often lash out at technical details by advertising in the trade press. Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to win the race with over 100 orders. The company recently unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing funders an image of three people squashed together in a restaurant and captioned it: "Would you accept that?" "Boeing beats long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops," says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy. With changing diets, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats haven't changed radically. Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 gained 10 percent in weight, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. The waist measurement of the average 21st century American male is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics. Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened "jet set" was smaller. According to Airbus, research has been carried out that shows that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent. Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat dimensions and says manufacturers don't have discretion to decide how airlines balance air fares and facilities. The company also says that research shows that the in-flight experience depends on more than seat width. "It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful," says Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver. They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable. They know their business better than anyone. For passengers, it's all about elbow room, but for manufacturers, it's increasingly becoming an issue that can impact sales. Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a profound impact on the US or European export balance. As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets. Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine designs than the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER. Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats in the 777. The increased cost per unit is still less than currently used ten seat per row machines. "Boeing is therefore cramming more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus. On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicate many passengers are opting for the narrower layout, which could mean cheaper fares. "Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is, from an economic standpoint, the Airbus offering is driven by the 777 threat," said Mary Kirby, cabin interiors expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network. Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but rather a catalog of suppliers for airlines to choose from. The world-travelling jet salesmen even carry tape measures to check the facilities at the competition. Even if they tout comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional flights. Airbus offers an A350 with ten rows of seats, but says it has not yet sold one. Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more cabin adaptability, offering wide aisle seats for some jets. Without the backing of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle, but could detract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the fun out of smoking Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the fun out of smoking. A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life. More trials are needed before testing in humans, which may take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early results are good. "We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market, but have found their nicotine addiction to be stronger than these approaches," said Cornell. The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies. The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies. The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high. In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity. Unvaccinated mice, on the other hand, took a "time-out," the researchers explained, a sign the nicotine had reached their brains. The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies. Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical. But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories. As Professor Crystal has said, if a future human vaccine is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction. More likely, though, smokers would use it to quit. "They know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they won't enjoy it anymore, and that will help them break the habit," he explains. British scientists said the results were interesting but warned more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid Former New South Wales Labor Minister Joe Tripodi is under investigation by the State Corruption Service. The former NSW minister denies changing the maritime leasing rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held hidden interests in three properties on state-controlled land. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various Ministers of State to agree to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender after they expired in August 2005 to be extended. An investigation is now underway into allegations that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified on Thursday. In years of talks beginning in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases. The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms. In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which brought in $2.5 million a year for the Obeids, were renewed without a public tender. Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally advocated public tenders. But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who Tripodi confirmed had been pushing for a reform of the government's tenancy rules. A telephone transcript provided to ICAC showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ports Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority. "Was the subject discussed in those phone calls the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripod. "No," replied Tripodi. I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't. Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, official sources say Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News. The officer did not explain what the target was but said it was at least one. According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles. Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile shipments in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subject to 'authenticity test' The government is considering an 'authenticity test' for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures. If the test were introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to come to Australia. A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned government comments on foreign workers, saying they could be considered offensive by Australia's neighbours. "Loud statements like 'foreigners should queue' and 'Australians hire first' are a very uncomfortable throwback to a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market," she told the Australia India Institute today. Historically, that meant white workers should be protected — and if some in the region hear echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised. The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once envisaged by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen. Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to hold talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes while the others are still under consideration. If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked as to “whether the application is authentic in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after a history of companies that initially wanted to support a small number of workers eventually hiring hundreds. Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died, believed to be of a heart attack, after arriving in Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week. The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday. Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland. HS2 Ltd work proposes to have high speed links between Scotland and the north of England as early as 2026 when Phase 1 begins. Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together". Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the UK Government on the plan. Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands. Once Phase 2 is complete there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds. In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail link between London and the north of England to £42.6 billion from £32.7 billion. The UK Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and journey time improvements for Northern England and Scotland. These include the potential for a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London. Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network, bringing the UK and its cities closer together." We are moving forward with HS2 because of the huge benefits it brings. Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network. But it's also about the connection between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2. Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland." Speaking on behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "make a clear commitment" to Scotland's inclusion on the HS2 network. Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power makes a case for fast rail links across the UK." to explore a high-speed rail link in Scotland that would bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning. I look forward to examining the inquiry report with UK ministers next year and together deciding on the next steps.
Rules on electronic devices on airplanes remain in force in Australia for the time being Australian airline passengers are still required to turn off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is allowing U.S. airlines to change their policy so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided they are in "flight mode." Passengers are already allowed to do so for most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books on take-off and landing. Australian airlines are monitoring the decision, which is taking a lot of work for US airlines to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules. Air traffic control authority CASA also said it would look into the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases in Australia still apply. "CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on aircraft," it said. The issue is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew. Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, saying it is open to change but would need to be initiated by lawmakers. "We would welcome a review by CASA of electronic device approvals as we believe this would improve the customer experience now that we offer in-flight (wireless entertainment)," a spokesman said. Qantas said it would stick to the current rules for the time being. "Our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans at this time to change that," the company said. FAA regulations apply to US airlines. However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it. The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet. They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile device interference and amend manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and customer briefing. "After an airline confirms its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said. In rare instances of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing. The group also recommended stowing heavier equipment securely under the seat or in the overhead compartments during takeoff and landing.
Pawnshops boom in Singapore as crisis hits middle class At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga trades a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to help pay for her daughters' school fees. "My husband and I just bought a house, all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga. Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (approx. 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains. In fact, demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia -- where household debt is mounting -- that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawn shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange this week. Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get money — S$1,300 in Janani Amirthalinga's case — it's almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan. Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an APR of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent charged by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall. However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no credit checks or proof of income are required, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks. That's why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and mounting household and consumer debt. After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and easy credit thanks to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up the difference in a faltering economy. This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's identified growing household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness. According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in relation to gross domestic product in Asia. Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008. Economists are also worried about high consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week. On Thursday, data showed ongoing weakness in exports and a slacking in consumer demand. "The bottom line is that as costs rise, people in the middle to low bracket (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank. Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have fueled the trend toward pledging personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash. In Singapore, about 70 percent of pawned items at the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold. People say to themselves, "Gold prices are looking good, let's pawn grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month." The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia - where the company has four stores - but also outside of Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, managing director by ValueMax. The company is funding it with 60 percent of the $66 million it raised in the Singapore IPO this week. While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that not only do pawnshops offer cheaper rates than other lenders, but they don't directly add to the debt. "Customers are lending on items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables doesn't increase household debt," she explains. The pawnbroking business is increasingly being socially accepted as short-term, secured financing. Also, not all people who use pawn shops are in financial difficulties. Rich Singaporeans also come to ValueMax stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, receiving up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash. Customers come to us from every social class. "These include wealthy people borrowing short-term for a business or investment, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah. Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
A$325 million bailout for Tasmanian health care The Australian government is insisting on the tough conditions attached to the A$325 million bailout for Tasmanian health care to ensure the state government cannot squander the money. German Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek has said the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by the island nation's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic constraints. Funding for a four-year period was decided after Government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie. "The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today. The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency relief for election services. A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract treatments, are expected to clear the backlog. There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, residency training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals. "These investments are in line with ideas that affected clinicians have told me are the best way to improve Tasmania's healthcare system," said Tanya Plibersek. The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian government. The state must maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent. A three-member commission is established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible. As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if "it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable path." urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May. "I'm confident that the federal aid will go a long way in getting the state's public health system off the worry list," Wilkie said. According to the state government, these electoral performances will largely offset recent cuts. But the opposition's federal health spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "band-aid". "We are in the position we are today because the Labor state government has drained $430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV. It can't be that a state government rips nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends that's good news. Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also heavier fare than necessary. Set in 1760s France, the action tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to a convent by her family. When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of one supremely sadistic matron and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another. The film never strays into lust or sensationalism - and therein lies its problem. The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tormenting penitent shirt for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability, a monitoring group says Syria has destroyed key facilities producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said Thursday, while heavy clashes erupted near one of the sites in the north of the country , where suspected toxic substances are stored. Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announcement came a day ahead of the November 1 deadline set by the Hague-based Damascus organization to destroy or render "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities. including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition. The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline aimed at eliminating all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014. The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons. However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies. There are believed to be around 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin. The announcement came at a time when fighting was raging Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say has a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday 120,296 people had died. Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children. On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias. Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners. On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000. This number has not yet been updated. The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country. Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups. The observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday but gave no details. The fighting underscores the danger chemical weapons inspectors face as their mission to rid Syria of its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war. According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now confident that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all key production and blending/filling facilities identified by Syria." Therefore, "no further inspection activities are planned at this time .” Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections, visiting 21 out of 23 sites specified by Damascus. Visits to two facilities were not possible due to safety concerns, inspectors said. On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program items there had been moved to other named facilities, which were being inspected," according to the Syrian statement. It was not immediately clear if the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit. Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month. "I salute the bravery and courage you all have shown in accomplishing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, director-general of the monitoring organization in a commentary released by the OPCW. For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, a splinter group of Shiite Islam. Regarding further developments, monitoring group head Rami Abdurrahman said there was a powerful explosion at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal Latakia province on Wednesday. The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
Anger at verdict for Bali bombers Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried, as they believe Umar Patek has been summoned should be shot. Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted persons, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bomb attack. With a suspended sentence, he could be released after 15 years. The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta's popular tourist area that left 202 dead, including 88 Australians, and injured many others. He was also found guilty on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a spate of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000. Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence, although they could have asked for the death penalty for the man, nicknamed the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker. The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago. Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death. I really think he should follow in the other guys' footsteps. "He should be put in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP. Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again. The Sari Club was leveled when, just after 11pm on October 12, 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked in front of the nightclub. Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack full of explosives. He went into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while on life support. Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago. Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else. To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live. Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds isn't much. Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial. He eluded capture for nearly a decade but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden nearly four months later. During the hearing, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in a bid to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda. "He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said. Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the suffering he has caused other people. The verdict came ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by commemorations in Bali and Australia. "There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said. Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but not make cell phone calls) Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but cannot use cell phones, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday. However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately. How quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference. Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage policies to reflect the new regulations. The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes. Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue. "Depending on the status of the plan, we may authorize expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement. Currently, passengers are required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed. You can only start them again when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light. Upon entering the landing approach, passengers must turn them off and not restart them until the aircraft has landed. Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said. Most new commercial aircraft and other aviators that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria. Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes. "If the new regulation is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit," commented Glading. To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this topic. However, Internet connections below three kilometers for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data remain prohibited, the authority explained. Passengers are asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode. So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was publicly forced off an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the gate. And heavier equipment such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin. Cell phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has regulatory authority over telephone calls, not the FAA. FAA May Lift Ban on Certain Electronic Devices During Takeoff and Landing Last month, National Transportation Safety Board safety expert Mark Rosenker, national transportation safety expert, told CBS News cellphones are still considered a risk. "Cellphones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation devices, but because we at the FCC know that airborne transmissions can also interfere with cell towers," Rosenker said. An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices. In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to relax restrictions on its use. Critics, such as Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban. The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as device usage has become ubiquitous. Some studies report that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device. The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of passenger-carried FM radios interfering with navigational and communications equipment, which was the latest technology at the time. New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference. Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers when flying at altitude for a number of years. The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference. The vast majority of passenger planes should be eligible for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said. Today's electronic devices generally emit far less radio frequency emissions than previous generations. E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you turn the page. But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger. Amazon.com is among the proponents of easing restrictions on passenger device use. In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and did a test flight to identify problems, but couldn't find any. FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices. Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed the interference from the devices was real, although the risk was minimal. Other committee members said there were only anecdotal reports from pilots suggesting the devices were interfering with aircraft systems, and most of them were very old. However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to instruct passengers to turn off instruments during instrument landings in poor visibility. A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for today's highly tech-savvy travelers. "We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a comfortable passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. TravelAssociation.
Bird rescued from North Sea oil rig by air rescue service released again A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service and found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild. The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was cared for by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their sanctuary in Alloa. Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was held up by the strong winds over the North Sea." Apparently the exhausted bird took refuge on the oil rig. He added: "He couldn't fly any further, so we were contacted for help." When released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain? Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing business around the table and defining what those who make Britain prosperous and jobs want to change in our relationship with the EU. To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think of the UK, the economy and the EU. YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, roughly representing UK business sizes, sectors and regions. The results of the survey will surprise many. We found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while those in the EU are stagnating. They want governments to favor new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than dwell on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions. Asked for their views on specific regulatory issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster. There was general dissatisfaction with the single market as businesses said the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone - even 40 per cent of big companies agreed with those traditionally most pro-European. Finally, and perhaps this says most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority would like the UK to steer a course towards deal change and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics. This insight, shared by companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "change that makes sense" that will put the reins of action back in the UK. A lot is at stake - changing the deal and giving Britain better terms would see 16 per cent change their minds in favor of staying in a referendum. The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British business is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain's terms of EU membership. It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from a renegotiation. A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the Eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union. The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, the results of our survey show, which means an increased focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental shift in Brussels' approach to regulation.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom's board of directors. "Today's event is a milestone: construction work has started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday. The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent. South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe. A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas destined for Europe is stored, puts conventional routes at risk, officials say. Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever". Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes live in 2015. According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries on the planned route should start by the end of the year. The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices on airplanes -- although cell phone calls remain banned. Warplanes attack a depot of Russian missiles in the port city of Latakia, officials said. This appears to be a continuation of the Israeli campaign to prevent arms proliferation in the Middle East. Federal appeals court blocks judge's ruling that NYPD's controversial tactic discriminates against minorities. Nearly 100 African immigrants trying to enter Algeria die of thirst after two trucks break down in the middle of the Sahara. Experts say the violent crime that killed 14 adults and seven children was nothing but pure coincidence and not a sign of growing violence in America. Instead of being unsettled by the US government's default, investors have focused on what probably matters more: the Federal Reserve. The Californian plans to contest what may be the first such subpoena, arguing that the internet-connected glasses make navigation easier. Police say they have video of Mayor Rob Ford smoking a crack pipe. Even close allies keep secrets from each other - and will try everything to find out what is being held back. The Vatican wants to know how Catholic parishes around the world are handling sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and gay couples.
Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA staff accused of sex offenses allegations against Jonathan Lord Two New South Wales (NSW) YMCA staff have been charged with child sex offenses before allegations were made against nanny Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011 the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse has learned. However, in the opening statement before the commission, the YMCA said it had "never dealt with an incident of child sexual abuse within the organization." Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education teacher was convicted in 1991 of abusing children in his care. Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but was not aware of the second. He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external reviews of the YMCA that have recognized the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety". Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was notified that it received the second-lowest rating out of a possible four in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August of that year. Hare, who started at the YMCA when he was 21, admitted management failed "from me down" in hiring Lord and failed to ensure employees were aware of their obligations to allow violations of child safety guidelines Report. Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two-year stint with the YMCA. He was sentenced to at least six years in prison. But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural issue that prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety violations. Staff said they observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling one he loved it and letting children play with his cell phone . Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the children's service director, Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time was very unapproachable". The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors. Instead, he said, it was their friendship with Lord that affected their judgment, which is why they didn't report him. Hare said he had communicated his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson the organization needed to take from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed with him. Hare said the decision to urge staff to sign non-disclosure agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA children's services executive director Liam Whitley. He said this was to avoid contamination of the evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly implemented. The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, Griffith University professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission. He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, screening, onboarding, training and supervising staff. The hearing was adjourned until December 20th.
Tony Blair has said he would jump at the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits a comeback is unlikely. In an interview tonight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old shared his views on various domestic issues. Since resigning in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, confining his comments mostly to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Middle East Quartet of Peacemakers. When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but that's unlikely to happen, so..."
When the horse show experts flocked to Cardiff to crown the Horse of the Year, they knew the competition was going to be tough. But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland. The pre-kindergarten tot, who only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted easily through the three rounds to take first prize - beating 30 adult opponents. The inseparable couple, both of the same height, were praised for their demeanor, demeanor and style at the annual competition, held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff. Appearing against both men and women in stylish bowler hats, he had his flat cap on at a cheeky angle and was leading two-year-old Toffee around the ring. Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to handle the pony, which was well beyond his years. And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and personality. Fenton received Toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and has practiced with the Shetland Pony every day since. His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee make a great team." They had to compete against the entire field and walked away with the gold trophy and rosette. It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won. Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him. The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years. Howells said, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone was cheering and clapping for him." He walked the length of the arena on sand and despite looking tiny he did a fantastic job. Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he takes care of. The way he started it won't be long before he's in the Horse of the Year Show and I'm sure he'll do well. A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony." Together they make a great team. The judges rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they performed and presented in the demonstration ring. They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and handler - and that's where Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring. I'm sure Fenton's cute attire played her part, it really suited the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after call for reform A Chinese newspaper which had a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said. The Guangzhou-based New Express ran a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou. But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to fabricate reports about a state-owned company. Now the New Express is undergoing a "comprehensive rectification", the regulatory authority explained. The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Bureau of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television. Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013. "The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement. She said the decision was made to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter's license." In addition, they "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant people in the New Express be identified and the New Express leadership team immediately reviewed." Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion. After he was arrested, the newspaper ran two front-page calls for his release and backed his journalistic work. But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he was paid to publish false reports. "In this case I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public," he told state news broadcaster CCTV. I did it primarily because I wanted money and fame. I realized that I did wrong. Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly verify the reports. Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television. Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
US-Mexico Railroad Drug Tunnel Discovered One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered. US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they had ever found. The tunnel, which zigzags the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA. There are countless nondescript warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks. The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, authorities said. When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized, according to court records. Three men who authorities said were working as drivers were charged with possession and attempted sale of marijuana and cocaine. They face prison terms of between ten years and life if convicted. In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels. The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006. Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after October's marijuana harvest in central Mexico, posing a challenge for drug cartels on how to get their product to users quickly. In 2010, authorities found a 2,100-foot long passage of rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition notice to Assange British police today issued an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum. Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Australian a "order to turn himself in" to appear at a police station, adding that he could face arrest if he failed to do so. Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex-related charges after his options under UK law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month. Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum. A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "served a summons to a 40-year-old man to present himself to a police station at a time we chose." He continues to violate the terms of his bail release. The embassy did not comment on the service of the police request. Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the investigative website WikiLeaks.
Driver fined £1,000 for speeding at 130mph with hot drink between his legs A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 130mph with a hot drink between his legs . Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27th. After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs. In Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention. He received seven points and a six-month driving ban. Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and a £100 victim's surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners to tackle London's speculative bubble The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure but is awaiting the final decision from Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes valued over £2m costs and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company rather than as individuals. Already, stamp duty receipts from the Borough of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which totaled £708m in the 2012/13 tax year, exceed receipts for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber Region together. Cook said: "Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of associated anti-evasion legislation, it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are undertaxed, notwithstanding the impact of the outdated council tax system." Make investors more reluctant to buy property in London or discourage owners from selling,” he added. Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in London's affluent South West Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% in the last year. Central London prices showed steady annual growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by an emerging 'domestic' market comprising the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5 %) experienced an upward trend, according to research by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on how a dog's tail wag is related to its mood. Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's perspective), while nervous dogs wagged their tails to the left. But now scientists say other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences. Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions." Here we tried to look at this in other species. He also noted that in dogs, like in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left side movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions. To learn more about how dogs react to their fellow dogs wagging their tails sideways, the researchers monitored the animals while they watched videos of other dogs. They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed their behavior. We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves one way and the other Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate other distracting aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.” When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the wagging dog's perspective), they remained completely relaxed. However, when the tail tilt was predominantly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate increased and they looked restless. According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs don't intentionally communicate with each other through these movements. Rather, he believes that the dogs learned from experience which movements to worry about and when not to. He said, "If you have multiple encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction is more likely to be associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you respond based on those experiences." The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their pet's emotions. John Bradshaw, a canine behavior expert and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to look at whether left and right are important for dogs. Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they're looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when they're looking at a contented dog. Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: "Dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when its 'tail' wags to the left than to the right, rather than fidgeting - exactly the opposite of what it was in the Italian study." According to his The differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs. A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained. "While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw. But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness Rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a Glasgow gig after their lead singer fell ill with laryngitis. The Sheffield band were due to play the Hydro on Friday. However, due to lead singer Alex Turner's illness, the concert has now had to be postponed. The band's announcement comes after they had to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday. In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to cancel tonight's show at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and following medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also forced to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1st April. 'Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis which is why he is unfortunately unable to perform.' The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20th, while the Hydro in Glasgow has been rescheduled to November 21st. All tickets remain valid for these shows. We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience this has caused. Please contact customer service at the point of sale where you purchased your ticket if you need further assistance.
Pope Francis will appoint the first cardinals in February Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday. Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor. There are currently 201 cardinals. However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer vote in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 "eligible cardinals". In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistory. "Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be scheduled," Lombardi said. Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote will likely have fallen by February. He explained that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals eligible to vote back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes. Next year's consistory is significant because it is the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said. At the moment there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy. "It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said. Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, yet they have only a tiny number of cardinals. The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of Francis's Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church. In the past, the pope decided everything alone. "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said. He explained that it was "very possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice. But we haven't been in this position before - it's all brand new. Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be appointed cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he is appointing".
GM Recalls New U.S. Pickup Trucks for Seatback Repair General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix an issue with the manual seatback, a release said by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday. Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for reclining the front seat back. Because of this, they do not meet federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints. "If the vehicle is rear-ended, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury," read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website. The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th. Deliveries of the GM trucks began in June and represent the leading US automaker's most important model launch since its bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009. GM notified vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October. NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which hurt auto sales in October. Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said Friday. In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks. GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperate cry from an Obama voter I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change was possible He says Obama made a commendable effort that was thwarted by Republican blockade tactics The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, which Drone Strikes Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have been Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard Medical School. I am currently reading a terribly sad book. It's a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope during my dreary sophomore year in med school. It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs on the 2008 presidential election. When I finish my patient notes and go to bed at night, the book takes me back to a time when politics cost millions inspired and could take your breath away. The election was a landslide victory and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic significance of the hour. My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find. A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was poised for change. When Obama took office back in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%. And then I close the book. Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, like being jerked out of a dream. Those optimistic times are hard to remember - they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities. In the years since I first voted, something has indeed changed. But it's just not something I could have imagined. I recognize the great and multifaceted things Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military pullout from Iraq, ending the army's enforced homosexual silence and killing Osama bin Laden. I agree that partisan deadlock tactics have overturned too many aspirations designed to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few. But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts at explanations. I've reached a point of political despair. The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why they allow foreign heads of state to be wiretapped or drones to kill innocent children overseas. It fails to explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished. It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was assassinated without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election. It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House's efforts to silence the media were "the most aggressive...since the Nixon administration." And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed. I don't know if that's what I should have expected. Should I have understood when I was 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it? Obviously, MP is not a predictable course, with an opposition party and fortuitous events like the Newtown massacre dominating the public debate. But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely self-elected. And that bothers me the most. I re-elected Obama in 2012 not because I was excited about his candidacy. Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, seemingly unable to determine his direction and positions. I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing about for so long. But with Obama's approval ratings slipping below 45% this week, this book has made going back to 2008 all the harder. It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air. This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. In a meeting with campaign officials after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause. "I want us to find our magic again," he said. We must remember who we are. It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more. The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit. The mining tycoon, who is in a court battle over paying $6 million in carbon taxes, made the allegation as he tried to brush off questions about whether he was in a conflict. The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate important to deciding whether to cut or scrap carbon and mining taxes. But Palmer maintained that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the legislation. "He has a huge conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets paid leave," Palmer said. Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by a margin of 53 votes after the recount. Palmer called for an overhaul of the vote counting process to make it faster. Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget. Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting? "We need a better system," he said. Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, put the data into a computer, dial immediately, and then at 6:30 p.m. have the result? Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots. Do you use them because then you can erase the results if you don't like them? Voting with pencils these days is amazing. The Electoral Commission has been examining options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand. Palmer, 59, said his policy includes an international airport serving the Sunshine Coast and that he takes his new role "very seriously". Public office is about serving the public. "We seek no reward other than that of history, that of being able to serve this community at a critical time," he said.
RBS suspends two forex traders The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is a further indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations on the currency market is picking up speed. Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they are cooperating with authorities in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day. The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation that the Libor interbank scandal has sparked. The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities. "Our investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago. Last month, people close to the situation alleged that RBS passed on the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a previous trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been furloughed from his current position as European head of spot forex trading at JPMorgan. Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was furloughed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly head currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week. None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing. Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said. UBS said this week it has taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged FX market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks. At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers colluded in transactions in the currency market. HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said. Banks are combing through years of instant messages and emails looking for instances of wrongdoing. News of these investigations has roiled traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but has come under pressure this year as low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators . Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying the vast and highly liquid forex market is nearly impossible to manipulate, but leading traders believe that is not necessarily true. A leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of banks' own internal platforms mean that "even with very small ticket prices you can influence the market". The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse said it had fired a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year. The bank promptly informed the responsible authorities and is cooperating with them. "We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law It's a major victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today ruled that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional. By a five-to-four vote, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — which requires US citizens to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty through 2014 — is constitutional under the state's taxing authority. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against. The court also upheld the remaining portions of the 2,700-page statute and also held that the health care code's requirement that states either expand Medicaid eligibility requirements or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally restrictive. Legal action against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business. The law was firmly opposed by all of the leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits Thursday against handset makers, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel's bankruptcy auction became. Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, is suing Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in US District Court in Texas. Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony. Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases. The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, hitting the heart of Google's search engine business. Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available. Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running Google's Android operating system, which faces fierce competition from Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products. In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for the Nortel patents. Google has increased its bid several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion. After being outbid by Rockstar on Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents. "Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in suit at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents," the lawsuit states. Rockstar is seeking hefty damages from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement was intentional, the allegation says.
Egypt inaugurates first freely elected President Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to spell the end of political strife in Egypt. Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier. With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago. He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges at the court, which sits on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple. "We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television. "Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has represented Islam since its inception 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization, was sharply targeted by the respective government. Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time. Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the Mubarak-era presidential pageantry, traffic was only momentarily halted to allow the motorcade to cross the usually busy street that the city center contains connects the southern suburbs. Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare wheel," his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself as a candidate not only for the Islamists, but for all those who supported the efforts of the 2011 insurgency against the authoritarian Mubarak wanted to bring target. "Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office. Mursi later went to Cairo University where he was to give his inaugural speech. He was formally greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to at attention. Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present. Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's main auditorium, chanting "The army and the people are one hand." Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s. Morsi on Friday took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended last year's authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers the military council had inherited from the ousted leader. But by taking the official oath in court rather than in parliament, as is usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue. Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet? Flight Center seems to be bucking the trend. The company has raised its full-year earnings outlook and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK. The travel company now expects adjusted full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous guidance. If current targets are met, that would mean growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record earnings of $290.4 million in 2011-12. According to managing director Graham Turner, Flight Center posted an 8% profit for the first half and had a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australia and the UK private business. "Year to date, our ten countries are profitable and some are on track to record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said. These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors. In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market. Flight Center's leisure business in the UK fared similarly well, while business customers also spent less here. The US business rebounded from a seasonally weaker first half, leading to a full-year profit expected for the third straight year. Flight Center shares rose 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools will be encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar English literature courses will require students to cover at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards. “Unseen texts” are also included in the exam to encourage broader reading. The combined course of English literature and language is abolished. From 2015, students are required to take a stand-alone GCSE for Language, with strong incentives to choose English Literature as a separate qualification. The Department of Education is due to release tomorrow the new syllabuses for English and Maths - the first subjects to be radically overhauled. Other core courses will be changed next year. In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework. In a speech over the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous". Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries. In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours. While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time to maths in the curriculum, coalition sources say the comprehensive maths test - combined with a greater weighting of the subject in rankings - is likely to encourage schools to allocate more hours. There is more emphasis in the curriculum on 'real life problems', including financial mathematics.

Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients The West African country doesn't have many doctors, only one for every 5,000 people Vote here or on your mobile device for Dr . Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013. You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for CNN Hero of the Year. The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work. For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father repeatedly pass out and travel to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him. Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon. At first he just broke his arm, but then inflammation developed and spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life. "There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle. We would have gotten him out of Cameroon if we had had the money. Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals for the treatment they had to offer. "It's not easy," comments Bwelle. You can leave home at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be first and not be first. There are a lot of patients. Some people even die because they have to wait. The situation has changed little since Bwelle's father died in 2002. In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. This compares to one doctor for every 413 people in the United States. But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit. Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditure is private. "The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle. And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life. Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it. dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the last year. He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé. He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care. Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people. Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and, with the medical equipment tied to the roof, drive across unpaved terrain to the villages that need help. Things don't always go smoothly. More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud. But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer. In these villages, free medical care is a real cause for celebration, and Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is happy to join in the happy celebration. The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients. "We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle. They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot. Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a range of areas. Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases. Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school but many poor families simply cannot afford. In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia. The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one. The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is powered by the group's generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning. It's a busy schedule, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated. "They drum all night so we can stay up and get on with our work," says Bwelle. On Sunday, the team drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done. The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- have performed 700 free surgeries in the last year and know their work makes a huge difference to the people they help. One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received now allows him to return to work. "It changes the future of my family," said the man. In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé. With this second job he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations. "I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, a sophomore in medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Bwelle's group. He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to go on these campaigns. For US and European medical and nursing students like O'Malley who support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home. "We can be present at surgeries where we help to swab blood or provide instruments for Dr. Hold the Bwave,” explains O'Malley. That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student. The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them. But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of accommodation, transport and guidance. "He's a hero without a doubt," says O'Malley. He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds. The almost constant work is not a burden for Bwelle. Helping others lead happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy. "I'm so happy doing this work," says Bwelle. And I think of my father. I hope he sees what I'm doing. I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain. Visit the ASCOVIME website and learn how you can help.
Obama backtracks on health policy Faced with criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health plan, you can keep it." President in recent days that he has deceived the American public. Obama qualified his original promise yesterday. "The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston. In response to the widespread media coverage of the layoffs, Obama urged Americans who received such notices to look to the open market for new insurance. Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less than projected. "They come a better deal," he said. The government said it was unsurprising that the 5 percent of the population who have their own insurance had to look for another plan because their contract didn't meet new standards under the Affordable Care Act. "I want to say straight to these Americans, they deserve better," Sebelius said at a testimony before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington. Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October. "I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said. I am determined to regain your trust. This comment by an irate Sebelius to an aide sitting behind her at yesterday's House of Representatives hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri. The issue was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare. After more than three hours of hearings, Long repeatedly pestered Sebelius to ask why the Affordable Care Act "architect" didn't voluntarily give up federally-sponsored insurance in favor of purchasing a plan from HealthCare.gov that they now sell to millions of Americans wool.
John Kerry, in unprecedented admission, says US espionage has "reasonably gone too far" John Kerry hinted at a softening of US defensiveness about its surveillance programs in an unexpected admission, saying the espionage is in certain cases "gone unreasonably too far". The Secretary of State also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for going on "autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about NSA espionage activities became public. The leaked information has drawn the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies. Speaking via video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the President and I, as well as others in Government, have learned of some things that have happened on quasi-autopilot simply because of the ability to which still goes back to WWII and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 9/11.” He then became the first senior member of the US administration to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also emphasized it that no rights had been abused. He said, "In some cases, this has gone unreasonably far." Determined to clarify, the President is conducting a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that abuse is taking place. I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process. However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations. He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.” There is a radical extremism in the world that is hellbent on killing people in the to blow up and attack governments. So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens? We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we knew in advance of such plans. Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on counterterrorism efforts, according to the chair of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs declared on Thursday. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration with surveillance by the National Security Agency. "It is very important to U.S. national security interests that Europeans stay on board in our collective effort to counter terrorism," said Murphy, a first-time Senate Democrat and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations and European Relations Subcommittee Affairs, in an interview in Washington. I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together on counterterrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs. Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone records in Europe have strained ties with some US allies, although the intelligence chief said this week the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States. Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders. The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides. Amid all the hubbub, Murphy said his agency is preparing for the congressional trip to be held this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses. The names of the other MPs taking part are to be published in the coming days. He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out. While Murphy stressed the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said there would be some "serious words." He said European governments need to be honest with their people about the kind of spyware they have been using for years. "While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones spying," Murphy said. Meanwhile, John Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to grapple with resentments over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and US surveillance activities.
Australian appeals jail sentence in Thailand A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was raped by a taxi driver has appealed the sentence and has been placed on bail released. Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the early hours of Sunday June 10 , while two other men held her. Later, however, video camera footage showed that she had made it safely to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend. Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story. She was in police custody at the scene until the court hearing. Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women's prison. She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rubgy league player who has contacted the Foreign Office in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter. Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia. "We're obviously very concerned, but we hope she'll be home as soon as possible," Tunks said. Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on bail of 50,000 baht. According to Australian reports, she is meanwhile vacationing in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand. The court said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had warned the appeal could result in a higher sentence of up to two years in adult prison. However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could be trying to improve its tarnished tourism image and that an acquittal could result.
