Jennifer Aniston: I'm always pigeonholed Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful. The Hollywood star has now made this unmistakably clear in an interview. "I'm always pigeonholed or given labels that have little to do with me and reality." "I myself don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful." "Honestly, I don't give a shit about these things." Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan". According to the magazine, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose bun and Mexican food. The question of wanting children makes her mad: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star. In her new film, Mother's Day, Aniston stars as a single mother of two sons. The film will be on our screens from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid His experience on horseback is manageable. At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach. It was a first for the 58-year-old. CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer After a few minutes, the horses remembered when they had finished work, they galloped home to the feeding troughs. A kilometer at this pace, I was scared. "It wasn't a good experience," says Langer. And that was the end of his riding career. On Saturday, Germany's all-time best golfer - 101 tournament wins - was back close to horses. He and his family were shown around the ALRV facility, and he didn't even mount a horse to take photos. Langer was in Aachen for the first time and therefore also at the CHIO. The reason was quite convincing. The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the golden sports pyramid as part of a small gala. The likeable athlete is not short of awards. Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year... Even the British Queen has ennobled him. Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid. In Aachen he met the first prizewinner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday. "This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it's not only given for sporting success, but also for social commitment." Langer has been promoting young talent for decades. And so he immediately passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros. Along with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday. The winners include track and field athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsledder Meinhard Nehmer, judoka Frank Wieneke, and show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich. Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday. After the official part, the illustrious company wandered into the Show Jumping Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was taking place. Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
A comparison of Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want. However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue. Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical difference. The one about the role of the state. Trump wants to keep it small when in doubt and warns of how the state can damage the economy - with taxes and regulations. Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says. He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims. He will massively reduce regulations, and he is campaigning for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies. Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has to open up opportunities for the disadvantaged and needs money for this. That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says. Interestingly, both are very close when it comes to infrastructure. It must be invested in, say Trump and Clinton almost word for word. The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War. State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans. Internal party discussions could therefore still come to Trump. The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer. Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and ramp up coal production in the US again. Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement. Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us." But not only in terms of infrastructure - the two competitors are also not too far apart when it comes to international trade agreements. Neither want to sign the TPP, the transpacific trade agreement. At the same time, neither of them want to isolate the United States from international trade - they just want to better protect American jobs. They should then also be better paid, demands Clinton, for example. The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. She wants to raise it to $15 an hour. It's not entirely clear what Trump wants to do on this issue: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says it shouldn't be changed. But the major discussion in the coming months is more likely to focus on the tax policies of the two camps. On one side is Trump, who wants to unburden the economy and citizens in order to boost growth. His critics accuse him of only widening the budget deficit. On the other side is Clinton, who wants to demand at least that the rich pay more taxes, and her critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experienced sexual violence" For women who flee alone, sexual violence is almost part of everyday life. When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized. A house offers shelter. Four women are sitting in a large kitchen. Each has a baby with them that is no more than one year old. One put her little son in her arms. He looks curiously into the room with wide eyes. His mother stares at the tabletop. Until she realizes she's being watched. She smiles briefly and kisses the little one. The scene looks normal. Until you speak to Katrin Bahr. She is the division manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women fleeing, among other things. The four women in the kitchen are refugees. They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women who have fled alone and their children in Bavaria. In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid. It was recently officially opened. 60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children. There are no men - not even as visitors. The exception is a security guard in front of the door. "It's no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence while fleeing," says Bahr. "Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as beacons of hope," she says. Other reasons for fleeing predominate among women: "Many sneak away secretly because they don't see any other way out." In their homeland they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution. That drives her on. This continues on the run. "It's not uncommon for traffickers to ask for a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water," says Bahr. And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families. Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is wrong, says Bahr. Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often viewed as inferior and, in the worst case, abused. As a result, she estimates that around 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized. "Some of the children certainly didn't come about voluntarily." Many women are so used to not saying anything. "Or they don't dare to speak openly about what they've experienced because they're too ashamed." Since they often do not know what to do, Bahr demands that more accommodation be provided just for them. In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees. When asked if they knew of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no. In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation. Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesman. In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or separate houses in some communal accommodations only for single women and their children. The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women. The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be accommodated separately from men. According to a study published for the committee, "It is very important that men and women are housed separately." "If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be - ongoing - violence against women". The washrooms in particular should be separate and easily accessible for women, according to the study. How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the rush to the house in Munich. "Since word got around that we exist, we've had a long waiting list," says Bahr. You could easily open a second house.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured him. As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings. Instead, the drunk offender cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes. When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice. The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body. The police were able to arrest the perpetrator. While destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothes, the 50-year-old called his mother. She then alerted his sister. Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down. But she couldn't persuade him to leave the apartment. So she left the house with her partner. They met the man's ex-partner on the street. When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments? The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more responsible in the future. How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years? At the next council meeting, the SPD proposes an "Action Concept for Housing". But arguments are programmed. First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments? So far there is no regulation. SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban land, you have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." However, the cheap apartments can also be built in existing buildings. However, according to Bratmann, the big point of contention in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?" "We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but if possible 20 percent, of the apartments on such areas as social housing." A new city housing subsidy program, which will cost millions and has yet to be funded, aims to provide incentives. The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the factions." The CDU would like to make as few regulations as possible for investors. The left still wants tough conditions for investors. Irrespective of this, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is about to worsen. If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building administration. More staff is needed. It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers. But the program is not complete yet: the approximately 1,260 new apartments should be built anyway. But how do you make up for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, the funding for which will expire in the next few years? By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments. In order to prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, the city should now buy up expiring bonds. In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into price maintenance. That is possible in Weststadt. The problem could be solved in one fell swoop. Because in Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year. Around 1,800 apartments could be brought back into the price maintenance for cheap apartments. But the owners, the housing associations, don't want that. Because if the number of social housing in Weststadt increases drastically again, you will move away from the goal of so-called mixing. A concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist. The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion. Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board." They have concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses. But that doesn't mean that a compromise can't be found after all.
Supercup: Barca worried about Sevilla Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards winning the first title of the new football season. The Catalans play away against Sevilla in the Spanish Super Cup duel, with the second leg taking place three days later at the Camp Nou. In the showdown with the inferior cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion, the double winner has to do without Neymar, among others, who is contesting the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil. Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing. The German suffered a sprained ligament in his knee during training, which means that Barca's A-question has been settled in favor of Claudio Bravo, at least for the time being. The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been vying for No. 1 status at Barcelona for two years. Coach Luis Enrique has so far not made a clear decision in this regard and let Bravo go first in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions. Before the first competitive game of the new season, the Spanish champions have doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 4-0 by Liverpool in a friendly on Saturday. Even in the 3-2 test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. didn't really know how to convince. Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2:3 defeat against Real Madrid after extra time in the European Supercup and is aiming for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana". Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a league of his own with table tennis gold Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion. The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "holder" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday. The world number one won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Championships, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympics. Bronze went to Japan's Jun Mizutani. As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final and fought off the title amongst themselves. So it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the individual title in the sign of the five rings. The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS Lower Austria legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea. Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices on the plate, with no coaches with them between sets and during timeouts. They had withdrawn to the stands and let their protégés loose on each other in a fair competition. "The matches up to here I have played for my country." "I'll play for myself in the final," Zhang said logically. After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag. The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided. Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set. After that, he set the pace on the plate, leaving Zhang with a total of 13 points. Due to Ma's superiority, the exciting match that was expected did not develop. Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking rallies to be seen. Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1. The Belarusian suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment and had to "ultimately" be content with sheet metal. Incidentally, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) finished fourth at the Olympics at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits "huge problems" in the election campaign The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns that traditionally conservative states will also lose their majority. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah. A rare moment when the normally cocky and confident multi-millionaire voiced something of a concern, correspondents reported. Having knocked out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the White House race. "We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia. Blame false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding. Republican strongholds wobble Utah is usually a safe bet for Republicans. According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were tied. Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is usual for Republican candidates in the state. Arizona and Georgia are also considered endangered. In an interview with CNBC, when asked how he intends to stop Clinton's advance again, Trump replied: "Just like I've done before." And pushed afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will have a very, very nice, long vacation". He doesn't do anything other than "tell the truth". If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said. Then I return to a very good way of life. According to press reports, Trump's party threatened to cut funding to support his election campaign if he was unable to present better poll numbers. Instead, they want to give the Republican candidates for Congress more support.
Olympia: Brazen cheating on doping test The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case. Kenya's track and field athletes face trouble after the second doping scandal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. After an attempted cheating at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home. The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case. A Kenyan official said former sprinter-turned-coach John Anzrah provided a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of 800-meter sprinter Ferguson Rotich. This was reported to the team management of Kenya by the doping controllers. The world association IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to conduct its own investigation, said an IAAF spokesman. "Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," said an IAAF statement. "He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and posed as Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi. He held the accreditation of the athlete listed for out-of-competition testing by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Ferguson Rotich finished fourth at the 800m World Championships in Beijing in 2015. Four days earlier, the head of the Kenyan athletics delegation, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio games. He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money. According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport. Kenya has been under close scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses. When the IOC announced the more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular would be targeted. Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system. The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics. As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping policies are compliant with WADA rules. Kenya is considered a great runner nation. The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing. In a series of television reports by ARD, accusations were repeatedly made that doping substances are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is said to be a significant mentality of sports fraud. IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics. It was possible to prove that this sport was doped across the board and systematically. Russia's track and field athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival is presenting the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet. With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli. A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece. The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Maria. In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses. We always say that she is very Latin American. There are many Latin ingredients in its tempo and melody. It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra. I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood! In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria. She nostalgically recalls her love affair with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances. The role of Maria has always fascinated me. Firstly, because she is musically extraordinary! And then there is Maria's personality. She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright". So she's smart, of course naive, and very passionate. "She's very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli. Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist." It is such an honor for us to work with her. She is an incredibly generous person. And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" Conducting is a necessity for him. You can see it in his every move, in his looks, it's his life! It's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him. We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that's very important at all! For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism." Today we have the refugees, back then the Puerto Ricans went to New York and the New Yorkers didn't want them. They're the same themes, and they're just as meaningful today as they were then. 59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
Turkey: Kurdish community anticipates mass exodus "Anyone who doesn't conform and praises Erdogan is sitting on a packed suitcase," says Ercan Karakoyun, the chairman of the Dialog und Welt Foundation, which is close to Gülen. The Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term. In the medium term, it could even be "several hundred thousand," believes the chairman of the association, Ali Toprak. Because of the harsh actions taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany. "In the short term I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term several hundred thousand people from Turkey seeking protection in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," said the association's chairman, Ali Toprak, to the "Welt" on Friday. Because the government already carried out punitive actions in Kurdish strongholds months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey. After the failed coup, there would be secular and oppositional ethnic Turks. Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey. "It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak. The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities. Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave the country. "They are the last large minority in Turkey; the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters". A "witch hunt" against critics of Erdogan is also taking place in Germany. For the first time in the past few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany. The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad. More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition. The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics. "Anyone who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on a packed suitcase, including the Kemalists and secularists, by the way," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Dialogue and Education Foundation, which is close to Gülen, told Die Welt. As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the putsch, the Turks made up the largest group of people entitled to asylum in Germany who were recognized because of political persecution. As of June 30, there were 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as entitled to asylum (39,625). This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects. According to the Basic Law, only those who are individually persecuted for political reasons, i.e. by the state, are entitled to asylum.
Mecklenburg-West Pomerania: "Go where it hurts" Strange Mecklenburg-West Pomerania: The locals don't hear anything about the summer election campaign - and vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood. In 2021, the state elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year. Because it doesn't get any stupider than before: summer vacation, heat and the state election campaign - that bites. The locals who are supposed to be persuaded by the campaigners are on vacation. The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals and are therefore not allowed to vote for the state parliament. There are also practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who put up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and then count the votes are difficult to find. Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last day of vacation, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to endure another election campaign that narrowly misses the people. The hot phase, if you can even call it that, has just begun. And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office. The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls. It will be exciting to see how strong the newcomer AfD performs and what is left in the end that is suitable for a coalition. Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is conducting an almost inconspicuous election campaign apart from his large posters. He travels through the country, hands out roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did. Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossoming of the AfD. Your refugee policy, your "we can do it" have accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office now. The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already seen what it's like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time. She twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's federal constituency is in the northeast. But the target group wasn't right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than people from Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania. "The majority were probably from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently complained to NDR. But it doesn't hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel. Otherwise, the north-east CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons. That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role". The Union has also noticed that its base in the country is crumbling, that it has to make a lot of effort to reconnect with the people. You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exist. However, the advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his comrades-in-arms is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used". Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to campaign particularly hard. In surveys, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind their partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19). In the 2011 election, the SPD clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22). The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make it into the state parliament. They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday emergency and are largely moving their election campaign to the Internet. "Online election campaign" is what state chairwoman Claudia Müller calls it. Otherwise, green election campaigners go in search of local voters among the vacationers. Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently cruising through the Mecklenburg lakes in a houseboat and thinks it's beautiful too. Her impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".
B27 renovation: restaurants suffer from closure There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated. There is praise from everyone for those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5:30 in the morning and does not end until around 8:00 p.m. "They made everything pretty snappy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station. This is a super team. There is also no delay. The construction site was relocated to the south halfway through at the beginning of the week, and everything should be finished by the end of October. The courtesy of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to setting up temporary driveways. Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation in the town has eased. Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 again from Ofterdingen. The alternative traffic through the town seems to be decreasing. "There were some serious complaints," says Florian King, the deputy head of the main office responsible for the traffic management of the renovation. The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many people looked for shortcuts and trusted their GPS rather than the signs. Which led to some trucks getting lost in residential areas. Since the speed limits were not observed either, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen. "There were significant overruns," says King, who himself made himself aware of the situation on site. There were already two to three flashes per minute. The fastest was traveling at 77 km/h in the 30 km/h zone. Since the construction site has moved on, things have calmed down. For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg. Business people don't like to be looked at. But anyone you ask will tell you that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a drop in sales. However, some are more affected and some are less affected. Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, will hardly have any consequences from the restructuring. Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "slight decline at most" at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that "there is of course a lack of walk-in customers". The bars along the street have been hit the hardest. J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words. That is already life-threatening. Not only him, but all restaurants were "hit hard". The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing. We have to be happy about every euro of sales. He puts the drop in sales at "well over 50 percent". The road rehabilitation had "thrown back his business by two years". He had to lay off half of his employees. If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been laid off, politicians would have reacted differently. Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation by pointing out that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 result in sanitation, carry. Göhner knows of other districts where something like this was handled more generously. Despite all the complaints, Göhner is certain that his restaurant will continue to exist. After all, the family business has been based here since 1715, he refers to the long history. He can understand that other regular guests stop by less often because of the complicated traffic management. If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else. Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return once the renovation work is complete. Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history. Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being tweaked in the name of fighting terrorism. After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package. But what does a toleration status have to do with terrorism? And what does the coalition partner say about all this? Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciler. All of his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, said the interior minister when presenting his new security package. You don't overwhelm anyone. Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties. I take part in that too. As interior minister, however, he wanted results and an "attainable consensus" within the coalition. After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière allowed a little time to elapse before presenting his conclusions for security in the republic. But they are now all the more extensive. Some things are already known, announced, targeted: It is not new that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication. Not even the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law. The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities also comes as no surprise. In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD has so far been unable to make: He wants to make it a punishable offense to solicit sympathy for terrorist groups and strip jihadists with dual citizenship of their German passports. "These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man. Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway. De Maizière also presented a few new ideas. Some of them are tough: He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more options for detaining people before deportation. Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and open their social media accounts for a security check. When it comes to toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants some people to be even worse off than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity. Some of this is politically and legally sensitive. Some things still seem immature and leave questions unanswered. And with some points - the unequal treatment of tolerated persons, for example - the question arises: What does that actually have to do with security and terror? Yes, says de Maizière, it's important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror. But it cannot be denied that the attackers in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees. In addition, many people were concerned about security given the high number of refugees. And things that deeply concerned people couldn't be ignored, even during election campaigns. Internal security has moved enormously into focus. First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice. Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach. The uncertainty is great. And yes, there are elections coming up. The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the subject of internal security. The past few days have seen a lot of tension between the two parties. First a nasty argument about the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of ideas on security policy by some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burqa ban and a move away from dual citizenship. Here, too, de Maizière strives for conciliatory tones. He doesn't think much of turning away from the one-two. We have pacified the discussion in Germany. Reopening it doesn't make sense. And he has constitutional concerns about a burqa ban. It remains to be seen whether his own package is constitutional in every respect and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner. There's a lot in there that could cause controversy. But the SPD is also currently trying to distinguish itself on the subject of internal security. Party leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals a willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still getting through unscathed. Despite the diesel scandal, delivery figures are increasing worldwide. But things are not going smoothly in all markets. In the recall campaign, there is a fuss about a term. Volkswagen is starting the second half of the year more cautiously with deliveries. Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest carmaker has been able to show a plus in the year to date thanks to its many brands and some well-performing markets. But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus weighed on overall sales again, as the Dax-listed company announced. The VW brand sold 449,100 cars worldwide in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year. In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year. In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth. Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July primarily to two fewer sales days in Europe. In addition, there was a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions". In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also had a negative impact, a spokeswoman explained. In the USA, where the emissions scandal escalated first, there is still a minus. The Chinese market is a major support for VW. All in all, the house brand of Lower Saxony, which was mainly affected, is still coming through the diesel scandal unscathed: after the first seven months, deliveries were only down 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles. Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to show a further increase in sales from January to July. Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide. Volkswagen had manipulated emissions tests with software. In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars to the workshops for conversion. In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars would not have any negative effects. After the vehicles have been converted, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance. After the conversion, the car manufacturer issues a "guarantee-equivalent" certificate to the customer, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as company circles said on Friday. Reason are legal subtleties. The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models. This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport. The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting took place. "VW has to fully meet the requirements of my investigation committee and the KBA." "Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry. VW has taken on the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type approval will remain unchanged. However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was said in business circles. With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with engine damage six months after the conversion - and could attribute this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it. In the interest of the customer, it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal leading to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as it was said. That's why VW doesn't use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany. Bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or overnight accounts". The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and sees no sign of it: normal savers "do not have to fear paying penalty interest on their savings". If banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 percent penalty interest. Raiffeisenbank Gmund will be demanding this fee back from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in current or call money accounts from September. "The first 100,000 euros are free." "The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul. He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use. "They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the head of the bank. "I can't lay down 4,000 euros for every million." He is now passing on the costs according to the polluter-pays principle. Simply leaving the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisen bank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank's board of directors. Most customers would understand and switched to other forms of investment. Only a few migrated to other banks. The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives explained: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks". Carrying them alone is "not permanently possible from a business point of view". Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers. The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros or more. Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, the competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong for that". A banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is a little more lavishly equipped". "That can become a problem for a small bank" if it guards money for free. Founded in 1911, the Gmund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee. Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region. The cooperative association of Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that calculate reimbursement of expenses for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst. The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, declared at the end of June: "The threshold for going negative towards private customers is very, very high". The competition is tough and there is a risk that investors will migrate to the competition. Customers in Germany will not put up with this across the board.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be defeated. "I'll keep my eye on the World Cup, stay confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro. He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the Sugar Loaf. "To be honest, it's hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin. He had to calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle. At the World Time Trial Championships in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title. "I'll take a close look at everything that we've changed lately." "This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday's 54.5 km.
Olympia: tennis pro Siegemund misses the semi-finals Laura Siegemund's triumphal march ended in the quarter-finals in Rio: the world number 32. from Metzingen clearly missed the semifinals of the Olympic tennis tournament with a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No. 34). Siegemund, plagued by back problems, was only able to serve through once and looked powerless compared to previous rounds. On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2), who was still hoping for a medal, had the chance to advance to the semi-finals. The Australian Open winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10). Tommy Haas was the last German tennis pro to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000. The last time there were two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games was in 1992. A German duo has never been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this. The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby. Microsoft did not say on Thursday how much money would flow into the acquisition. Beam only launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users. You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself. For example, they can give players missions and face enemies, as well as provide equipment. Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports. Facebook should help on the way to becoming a global media event. The advertising industry is already listening. The employees of the start-up, which was previously based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as announced by Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi. Nothing should change for customers as a result of the takeover. According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console. The market of live streaming of video game activity is currently growing rapidly. Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars. YouTube Gaming is owned by Google parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer Germany's speeders have to get used to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash units are being tested that are designed to catch speed offenders particularly effectively. The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from the Vitronic company in Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident black spots where it would be too dangerous for the police to carry out mobile measurements. For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges that are to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure required to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera. However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive. The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted in encrypted form via a modem. Laser measurement technology can also be used to record all vehicles across multiple lanes at the same time. Variable speed limits and bans on entry based on time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored. According to the manufacturer, when raised, the trailer can be moved with any car with a trailer hitch. So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered when measuring so that the wheels disappear into the armored and, by the way, bulletproof outer shell. In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the speed camera from vandalism. According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also being used. Foreign authorities are also flashing the new technology: France recently ordered 100 more, after an order of 150 last year.
31 years of exemplary care for clarity The managing director of the water association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring. The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria". A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers. That's what it said some time ago in the original language in a contribution by Bavarian Radio. A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia honored the association. The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria". Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for the association for 31 years, 28 of which as managing director. He has now retired at the age of 65. The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, pumps around 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants. Member communities are the communities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach. There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities. The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the special-purpose association in 1988. "His tasks were very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance work to office and organizational work, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairperson. As outstanding events she named the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the Partial replacement of water pipes. There was no standstill and innovations were constantly being introduced because water means life and drinking water is the most important food. In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years. He put a lot of heart and soul into his water association and he really lived the water association as if it were his own company. A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was able to present the Veitenstein Group's successful concept for nitrate reduction in front of the Lower Franconia water forum. For this he received a lot of recognition and praise. For his part, Rupert Göller praised water attendant Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years. He's the best water attendant and he was a loyal squire. Together we were an unbeatable team. From his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the special-purpose association as the highlights. However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation was the burst pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on January 3rd. Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water. The supply from Neubrunn could also only be maintained because the elevated tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt. The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it." "Medicine has made great strides," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera". When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she was going to die. Tiago, who is now eight, has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists. "To give an example: if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko. But he is the happiest person on earth. Tiago stems from Netrebko's association with bass-baritone Erwin Schrott. She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship offense in Bargteheide - man shoots at partner A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district), fatally injuring her. "The man called us himself and said he had shot his partner," said a police spokeswoman. The perpetrator is on the run and a public search is being conducted for him. Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car. The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and bald. The police have since released a photo of him. It's a few years old though. The man is now bald. The man should not be addressed directly. Police said he could still be carrying the gun. Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110. The police speak of a "relationship crime". The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981. The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the course of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; but she confirmed that a person had been killed. "It's a homicide." "We're not saying more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck. According to eyewitnesses, a special task force (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - a ray of hope for the German steel industry The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in the millions. Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidy are off the table. The exemption from the renewable energy levy for the existing plants for the so-called self-production of electricity in the German steel industry will remain, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition). "I'm really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay. According to the German industry association, the steel industry is threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year. Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. An EEG surcharge of 20 percent only applies when the generators in the steelworks are replaced. But even this is not collected in the steel industry. IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on generating its own electricity. This largely establishes the status quo of the previous regulation. Gabriel's successful efforts are of particular importance for the steel industry. "This is a first step with regard to our 'Steel is Future' campaign." "More must follow." "Climate and employment targets must also be weighed up when it comes to the reform of emissions trading," explained IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and considerable price pressure. The situation worsened last year when the world's largest producer, China, threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of flagging domestic demand. European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping. In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat. On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel are having an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened. It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is. The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday. Recently, prices have tended to stagnate again. The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions. Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual plants. Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015. In July, German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders. With 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, as the steel trade association announced on Friday. After a brief increase in May, the volume manufactured has now fallen for the second month in a row. Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's level. Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects output to increase in the coming months.
Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, during her teacher training course she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizens’ Choir. "Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. After a rehearsal she feels balanced, happy and generally more alive, she says. At the same time, she is doing something good for her health and spirit. Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors' League. Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler. By being together regularly, seniors can make and maintain social contacts. Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people. Ursel Kipp has also had this experience in her choir: "Communicating and organizing, being able to rely on others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together". Singing can be exhausting in a good way, says Hackler. This is because seniors train deep and controlled breathing. If you regularly challenge your lungs, you won't get out of breath so quickly in everyday life. Singing is also an ideal hobby when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age. Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations. In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in our free time, she explains. Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people brings back many memories, often linked to positive feelings from their youth. Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia can remember events that happened a long time ago. Singing also demands a special performance from the head, explains Lenz. Concentrating on your own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge. Older people in particular who live alone practice not only concentrating on themselves. Another positive aspect is the recognition one gets from singing in a choir, says Hackler. An enthusiastic audience is great praise. Singing in a choir also increases self-esteem. Showing yourself: If I practice something for a long time, I get better and surpass myself - this experience strengthens. So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing. If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises. You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who can hear when a note goes wrong? When looking for the right offer, senior citizens have various options, says Hackler. If someone you know sings in a senior citizens' choir, you can simply join them. Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area. If you would like to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly. Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet. If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research. If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler. Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than tomcats to the cries of young animals. Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of kitten calls on adult animals. To their surprise, the meowing didn't leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved in the same way. Female cats can tell a kitten's level of excitement by the meowing of the little ones. They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who think they are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have discovered. Male cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always in the same way. "Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and more excited young animals are either not perceptible for the males or are not important," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH. She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology". In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten's cries differed with the urgency of their need for help. A total of nine adult tomcats and eight females from the animal facility of the MHH were observed. On the one hand, they were played calls from little ones, which were taken out of the whelping box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings. On the other hand, they were confronted with the screams of more aroused kittens, which were also picked up. The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample. "All the females, even those who had no offspring of their own, reacted differently to the screams," said Konerding. They turned more quickly to the speaker when it played calls from the much more aroused kittens. This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity. "It was a surprise that the males reacted at all," said the biologist. In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans. Here, too, some studies have shown that women react more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reports the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for the Supercup with "Gala" Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey. An arrest warrant has been issued for former football star Hakan Sükür in Turkey. He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group. For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey. Before the duel between the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is the order of the day. When the state of emergency was declared after the attempted coup in July, the government asserted that the everyday lives of ordinary people should not be affected. But that does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the attempted coup. It doesn't stop at football either. The public prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against former star footballer Hakan Sükür. Accordingly, Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group. Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames for the coup attempt. Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, it actually has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks. Erdogan declared the nightly "democracy vigils" in public places across the country to be over on Wednesday. Like the whole country, sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan. Traditionally, fans of the Besiktas workers' club in particular are not among the president's friends. But what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic historical experiences is their strict rejection of military coups. Even the fans agree on that - regardless of whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas. In the case of the "Gala" cup winner, Lukas Podolski will be particularly important again. The man from Cologne proved his sporting value last season: the 31-year-old ended his first season as his club's top scorer with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions. In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 winner. The newspaper "Fanatik" applauded him: "He was the best on the pitch." He ended the season in excellent fashion and secured the trophy for his side. Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champions found a happy ending. After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" were also eliminated early in the Europa League. In the Süper Lig it was only enough for sixth place. The season wasn't good. The trophy was the only way to win anything. "We did it and that's the most important thing," said Podolski. The year went better for champion Besiktas. Mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 goals this season as the Süper Lig top scorer. That's also the reason why fans keep hoping for the return of the 31-year-old. Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florence and only on loan to Besiktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return after his EM vacation due to the political situation in the country. "If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say so," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" club manager Fikret Orman. To do this, however, the striker would have to be willing to forego around a third of his annual salary, which is estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: these athletes still have a chance of winning a medal at the Rio Olympics 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and 2006). Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanova is not allowed to start in Rio. Other convicted track and field offenders can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio. The topic of doping continues to make the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio. The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had sued for her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 meters breaststroke). A bizarre scene presented itself: with a fake smile, she strutted into the hall and provoked with her appearance. When it was clear that she would not win gold, the audience erupted in a storm of applause. But there are numerous other athletes who, despite a history of doping, are taking part in the Olympic Games in Rio. Here is an overview: Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics. He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010). Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world number one in the 100m in 9.80 seconds and is considered Usain Bolt's greatest challenger. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month ban in 2010 after it was proven that she was taking the painkiller oxycodone. The 29-year-old defended herself that she had severe toothache after an operation. Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 world champion and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine. Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was banned for six months. The four longest throws this year can be attributed to the great gold favorite. LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400m tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months. A means of penis enlargement was responsible, asserted Merritt. This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world so far over 200 and 400 m. Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any other athlete has had so many medals subsequently revoked. Tikhon lost his 2005 world title nine years later after he was found to be doping testosterone. The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the European Championship title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse. The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also revoked, was returned to him due to a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS. With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings. Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favorite only tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio. Evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found in the 29-year-old world champion, the ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13th.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll on Friday morning. She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again. She planned her trip home for the beginning of September. It is still unclear whether Austrian citizens will also be affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon. The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll. In Hua Hin, around 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening. According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians. Two explosive devices went off again on Friday morning, killing another person according to the authorities. A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning. According to the police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers. Another bomb then went off in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, killing a city worker. According to the authorities, the explosive device blew up in a flower bed in front of the coast police station. Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several injuries. It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin. "The bombings bear the same signature," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters on Friday morning. "We assume that it is a coordinated attack." It is too early to comment on possible motives - but they are probably the actions of Muslim rebels. The Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the south of the country. The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism. "This is just local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta. In the past few days, the authorities had received intelligence information about impending attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and location. It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks. Police instructed officers across the country to increase security around key government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts. There are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand, but they are usually not aimed at tourists. In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years. After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities. High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area. After clashes between security forces and the Muslim population, non-essential travel to these provinces is discouraged. Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country. The attacks on Thursday and Friday came days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta. This gives the military great influence in the coming years. Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombings were an attempt to sow chaos as the country moves towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism. The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with bringing stability and order back to the kingdom. However, even the military has not been able to get a grip on the Muslim rebel uprising that has been smoldering in the far south of the country for years. More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict. Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists. It was the deadliest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. After several state offices, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution also placed the group under surveillance. "In the 'Identitarian Movement' we see indications of efforts against the free democratic basic order," said the head of the constitutional protection, Hans-Georg Maassen, of the German Press Agency in Berlin. Immigrants of the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way. That's why we're now watching the movement. The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012. She opposes "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through foreign infiltration". The protection of the constitution in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities". Maassen said his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices. "Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' try to pick up their target group where it is," said the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. In general, extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language, often with pop music. That's what Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists. This is not a fussy advertisement for one's own cause. The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally. Young people are particularly susceptible to this. This is dangerous. Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the "Identitarians" and AfD politicians. Maassen said he had no knowledge of this. For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point. It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction through certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist. The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party. This is not recognizable. In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maassen said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context. But in recent years we have found that right-wing terrorist structures can exist. There was the 'Old School Society' group or the Freitaler group. It is quite possible that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups will form that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives. A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable. The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks. Maassen expressed concern that many of the attacks were carried out by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene. That's the worrying thing. Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene. "Many people have committed crimes who previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or Left Party, who then became radicalized through right-wing extremist propaganda."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit The Olympians or world records don't always make the headlines at the Olympic Games. This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. In the aquatics center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times. He just disappeared - no matter how wide the section was selected. Habte then became a viral internet hit on social networks. In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind and finished 59th out of 59 starters. But it was his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media. Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games? The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming federation. This is distributed to promote swimming in underrepresented countries. Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different. Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race. The first nicknames quickly made the rounds. Some media referred to him as "Robel the Whale". In reference to a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod". His time, he only clocked a minute and almost five seconds in the 100 meter freestyle, didn't matter. Comparisons to "Eric the Eel" were also drawn. Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The Equatorial Guinean swimmer's performance was memorable when he competed alone in a 100-meter freestyle heat. Moussambani was frenetically cheered on at the time. The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz has been robbed. According to the police, the 67-year-old woman from Geretsried left her shop around 5:30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor. When she returned the next morning at around 8:15 a.m., around 250 euros had disappeared from the register. Traces of the perpetrator could not be found. There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat so narrowly Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida. If the election to the US President doesn't work out, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea. Then he goes on vacation. If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he wouldn't really care: "Ultimately, it will either work out or I'll have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC. If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump said. He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia. Recently, more and more resistance has formed within his party.
Post enters the trade in electric vans An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action. Other companies are obviously interested in the vehicle. Swiss Post also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle. The group intends to start trading in the van shortly. Swiss Post also wants to offer its electric vans on the free car market from next year. "We want to start selling to third parties," said a Post spokesman on Friday. For months, the company has been examining whether it should also sell the StreetScooter it developed itself, which is used to deliver letters and small packages, to other companies. Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen. According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group intends to start mass production of the vehicles shortly. In the Post's own production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift. Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and that it was aiming for a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term. "We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July. I can imagine that we will convert the entire fleet. The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures The consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann. The resignations came suddenly, but not entirely surprisingly. The difficult situation of the market research company GfK gave an idea that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become more insecure the longer the successes he has promised fail to materialize. Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world's number five in the industry is about to make a new start in terms of personnel. GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year. The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is leaving the Supervisory Board effective September 12. The company announced that the previous board member, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will assume leadership of the board of directors as of September 1st. He is to officially assume the function of "board spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found. The company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy as the reason for the resignations. A company spokesman declined to give details on Friday. It is currently still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future. In investor circles it was said on Friday that the disappointment among shareholders about the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago was great. Mr. Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011. "But the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible even after 5 years," it said. In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder becomes restless at some point. "If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said. After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was not able to stop its loss-making in the second quarter of 2016 either. At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the previous year. In relation to the first half of the year, sales shrank by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million. The company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation weighed on profits in the second quarter. The goodwill amortization of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience division gave the group a bottom line loss of 148.2 million euros. In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - bus slips in a ditch in Krummhörn: Eight injured In an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district). Two of the occupants suffered serious injuries, police said. According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, some of which was driving on the opposite lane. The bus came off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, as reported by a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police. "Due to the location of the bus, people could not get off the bus on their own," she said. The fire brigade freed the occupants. Six ambulances and an ambulance came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2. The uninjured travelers were brought back to the Pewsum district of Krummhörn by a bus. There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company. The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of waste water for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant will be EUR 3.44 instead of the previous EUR 2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros). At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures become necessary. After a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter. As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach district office, it was found that there were insufficient funds for these sewage systems. The Kasendorf store is legally obliged to operate the systems to cover costs. From October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their wallets. The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent. As head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems in the market town was necessary. In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverage from the previous calculation period must also be compensated. Schmidt justified the serious fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very small amount of sewage, which is between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year. For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact. In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining. Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three systems incurred extensive renovation and repair costs, not least because of their age. The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old. Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant had to be replaced due to damage. In the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option installed in order to be able to continue to comply with water law requirements in the future . Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses, there were the updated support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period." The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012. Steinhäuser made it clear that, given the small amount of waste water produced in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "make a big impact". At the same time, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared major maintenance costs for the sewage systems over the past 20 years. According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the plants mentioned will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are loss-making facilities.
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar. He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria. He risked everything to save the lives of others. Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime. Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the Bild newspaper, has so far saved almost 60,000 lives. 2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed-out houses and to provide first aid in the war zone. They are the heroes of the war in Syria. Omar was the face of the group: In 2014, a video of the civil protection officer, showing him rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house for 11 hours, went around the world. It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war. However, he never saw himself as a hero, said according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad." "If I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr." Shortly before Omar fell victim to an attack himself, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombing in Syria. The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one containing chlorine gas. A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath. "We are now removing the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," quotes the picture as quoting his last words before he died. The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old Rare sight. Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter. This shark was allowed back into the sea after being examined aboard the research vessel Sanna. He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic at a good 1 km/h - to this day. Greenland sharks don't give birth until they are 150 years old. The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, covering an average distance of just 1,220 meters in an hour. Only when it really matters does the five-meter-long animal accelerate to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal. However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a panacea for old age. In any case, Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old. "Incredible," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, commenting on this lifespan, which is a world record for vertebrates. The evolutionary biologist had suspected for a long time that Greenland sharks lived to be very old. Only the evidence was missing. Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen. Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter. Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks. They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter off Spitsbergen. These sharks still make prey: researchers found the remains of a seal in one animal's stomach, while another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear. They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the Arctic Sea, looking for carcasses that stagger down from higher water levels. Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic off Greenland or Svalbard between 2010 and 2013. The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters. In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method. This center of the lens of the eye is formed before the shark is born, and the proteins it contains are not renewed later. The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus. Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests spewed larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere. In contrast, the lens nucleus in the third-smallest animal, which is 220 centimeters long, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it must have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was examined in 2012. All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal levels of carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, in their lens core. In fact, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old. It was known that female bowhead sharks only have offspring when they are longer than four meters. The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length. Since one of the animals was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity at 392 centimeters and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks apparently take at least a century and a half to reproduce. That should also currently be a world record for vertebrates. It is no coincidence that such Methuselahs live primarily in icy waters. The previous record holder, a 211-year-old bowhead whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in the blubber on its neck, was also caught off Alaska. Due to the low temperatures, the organisms of the animals living there often run on the back burner. So they mature later - and age more slowly. In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large. Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat. The heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant. Another advantage: you have fewer enemies. "A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
A double pack of building land At the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to construction. The committee was relieved to hear Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin." After the property, subdivision and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying have been submitted, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the properties in the "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" residential areas (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) to interested parties. The municipal council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau will appeal to young families and sprightly seniors alike. As it was said, those who want to build can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council will probably discuss the allocation of the plots at its September meeting. In order to be able to meet requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to change the land use plan, which was only created in the spring of this year, in some areas. In the Unterzeitlarn area, for example, the commercial area already designated there will be expanded by two parcels in the direction of state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit The city on the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg. "It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field. After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue to conduct financial transactions throughout the EU from London. For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been approved in Great Britain. Large US banks are using it. Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs. The lobby group "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years. According to the IW, Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance regulator EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council. Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB. "The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW Professor Voigtländer. Although Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry, it performs worse, like Dublin, when it comes to infrastructure. Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach. The city also scores with readily available commercial real estate. "It's not that easy to find vacant, high-quality offices in Paris," says Voigtländer. In addition, rents for first-class commercial properties on the Seine are 50 percent higher than on the Main. In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime. In a ranking by the management consultancy Mercer, the city is seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37th. Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial center for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW. However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, say the economic researchers. The balance of power also speaks for this: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, and 62,500 in Frankfurt.
The city council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the St. Goar Rhine bank Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects from traders happily accept - after all, the retail trade in the city center is considered to be clearly expandable. However, the city council unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction. "In principle, we welcome new tradespeople, but this kiosk does not fit in at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage store attacked in Waldbröl A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage store on Waldbröler Gerberstraße. At gun point, three people in dark clothing, who had covered their faces, demanded cash from the employee at the beverage store and then fled, first on foot and then presumably in a silver VW Golf. Police did not say how much money was stolen. The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small. The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see. After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstrasse, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the entrance to the car park in the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of the B 256 (Schladernring). Anyone who made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: fun and games at summer camp The children and young people of the social-educational day group/social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Association spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers at their summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker. During the first week of the school holidays, the fun-loving group stayed in the quiet Hardtwäldle leisure center. Several full-day excursions were on the program. On the one hand we went to Bretten to visit the petting zoo. On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery. The third excursion led to Pforzheim. In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about everyday life and the diet of the Celts. On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and splash around. Children and caregivers were spoiled with their favorite dishes such as sour spaetzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese. Batik workshops were held, beautiful pieces of jewelry were created from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made from wood. Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the concluding "Colorful Evening". On the day of the journey home, the sun was shining and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimages to the Gate of Mercy The altar boys from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg. Four stages were mastered together. In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome for all altar boys, which is expected to be two years from now, the group of senior altar boys of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage hike lasting several days. Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and a decision was finally made in favor of the episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the Gate of Mercy open at the Freiburg Minster. 16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off. The night before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out to a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing. From Horb, the train took you to the starting point in Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady, and so the pilgrimage route from the cathedral began. The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures. But also on the way, the minis stopped again and again at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song together from a specially compiled pilgrim song booklet. The parish homes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays. At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and invigorating dinner and breakfast. On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Guetenbach. The next day, the stage to St. Peter began, which was the most strenuous stretch of the route, as the 500 meters in altitude had to be descended and then climbed again in the humid heat. The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening. After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg. Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the Gate of Mercy. With a small impulse God was thanked here. At the evening mass in the cathedral, the Minis who had arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert. After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar. The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis. In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train. In the end, all participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before state elections: SPD and CDU lose In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4th) and Berlin (September 18th) there are signs of significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU. This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday). While the red-black government coalition could just about continue to govern in the north, this is not possible according to the opinion polls in Berlin. In both federal states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent. According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent. The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD. The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent in the state parliament for the first time. Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent). NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each. According to the survey, the SPD would only get 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (2011 election: 28.3 percent). The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent. It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent). The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent. With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates, in contrast to 2011, would miss out.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone E-mail and internet in slow motion: Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago. The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster. The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5. It was thicker and larger, so it didn't feel comfortable in the hand either. On the contrary, it was pretty clunky. The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today. An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes. The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" hit stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone. Lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet for a few euros, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age. However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation. The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product as a "pocket-sized office" a few months earlier at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover. In fact, by the standards of the time, the new mobile phone could do a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, and the communicator could also be reached by fax. Even websites could be accessed via an HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slow. A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar. There was a small antenna and the phone could be flipped open like a laptop. Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen. The price was quite proud: 2700 German marks, about 1400 euros. The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros. In August 1996, nobody could have guessed that the Communicator would herald the beginning of the smartphone era. Since then everything has changed. The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia. The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up. Vendors dominate the market today, all of which came much later than Nokia. Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday life for many people today. In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide. Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units. Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros. Added to this is the thriving business of countless app providers and telecommunications groups. An entire industry has grown up around smartphones. The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came at the beginning of 2007, when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World. He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via a touch screen. Apple's triumphal march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today. Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, lost out. They finally disappeared, Blackberry is struggling. Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung are now in charge. The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention. On average, every German now looks at their mobile phone 88 times a day. "We all have to learn to put down our smartphones," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources on the Siemens board. Permanent availability is now considered both a curse and a blessing.
A controversial baseball star steps down Alex Rodriguez's tears ran faster than the US baseball star in his prime from base to base. After his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time on Aug. 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays. "I love this game and this team." "I say goodbye to both of them," said the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game entrant. Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees. His signature to a ten-year deal has brought him $27 million annually since 2007. Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary. As a player, Rodriguez repaid it with performance for a long time. With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he made some milestones. Hall of Famers Hank Aaron and Willie Mays are only two other baseball players who have similar scores on key stats. But the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball hall of fame. Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, his appearance off the field is controversial. In 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003. In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal. Rodriguez is the prime suspect for years of receiving performance-enhancing drugs through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida. After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches. "The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said smugly at the time. Even his farewell days are not without noise. While many baseball legends are given the big stage again in their final games, Rodriguez has often had to sit on the bench. "My job doesn't include a farewell tour." "My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi etched. After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had affairs with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got expressions of sympathy from fans of Yankee arch-rivals the Boston Red Sox. "We want A-Rod," chanted supporters during the 9-4 loss to the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio. Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases. A caught athlete almost won a medal. Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro became known. The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter steeplechase Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and were excluded - immediately before the start of the track and field competitions, which are already viewed critically, this news comes at an inopportune time. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was detected in Chen last Sunday. The Court of Arbitration for Sport CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time. On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final, missing out on bronze by just 0.09 seconds. Chen was scheduled to compete in the 50m freestyle heats on Friday. Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and hold a hearing. The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Arbitration for Sports and will accept the verdict." For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases. Also on the night of Rio, the news of Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself. "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," it was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT. She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the athlete. According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO. Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to the BNT, the B sample is said to have been positive. Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately spoke up with criticism of the athlete. "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said. "We Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded." For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-prone nation are not allowed to take part in Rio. On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz, tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier. Both deny taking it, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg. Before the start of the track and field athletes, the Danekowa case in particular is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport. The world association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from the start with one exception because of systematic doping, and the running nation of Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio. In swimming, the earlier offenses in China had also caused violent arguments between the athletes. Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang. "Sun Yang pees purple." "When I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio. Sun was also at the center of a dispute with Australian Mack Horton. "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said. Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month ban.
Data theft: Hackers blackmail their ransom so perfidiously Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so. According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been the victims of an attack with ransomware at least once, sometimes more than once, in the past twelve months. In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware blackmail. 40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again. According to observations by Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on company networks. If they are successful there, the ransom that can potentially be extorted is significantly higher than for private users. "We are currently observing an alarmingly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with "Welt". In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements. Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves. Initially, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has happened alarmingly quickly in recent months. Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it specifically looks for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos. The ransomware encrypts these files and permanently deletes the originals. The software then presents the extortionist's demands. In order to get the decryption code for the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, for companies it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production comes to a standstill. The damage is correspondingly higher when ransomware strikes. 22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of sales due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, and in one case people were in mortal danger. In Germany, hospitals have already been the victims of attacks on several occasions, and their patients may be at acute risk from the loss of medical records. "We always tell the victims: Don't pay, you're only promoting the problem," explains Kleczynski. But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back. It is difficult for managers to refuse the perpetrators' demands when the company is at a standstill. The hackers, in turn, know this and do everything they can to build up a good reputation. In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the extortionists and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service in order to make more money. They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay with Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free. And if private individuals are redeemed after paying a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted. Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write ransomware in about a week." However, it is more likely that there are three or four people. The programmers then sell their malware to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software kit. Previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting, and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. "It comes with a customization tool so you can change minor configurations, looks and branding," says Wisniewski. The blackmailers then look for other hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims. We live in a service economy. So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from one criminal and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible. Payment is made per infected computer. "Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread the messages," explains Wisniewski. The risk of ransomware is now well known to many companies who take better care of their data. More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to ward off ransomware using file backups and scanner software. Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies. "If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for a successful extortion, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski. Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is many times higher than before. In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets in the Internet of Things. At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could gain control of an Internet-connected thermostat. In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom for some victims. If the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating system, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all occasions HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan. Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday use. Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, appears rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, and it doesn't feel cramped anywhere. The materials of the interior are well made and appear pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off a bit. The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space. Not only is there a trunk of 453 l with the backrests up and 1026 l with the backrests folded down, but there are also the "Magic Seats". It's less magical than it sounds: the rear seat cushions fold up like movie theater chairs, providing storage space that's four feet from floor to ceiling. The trunk is easy to load, although the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008. The tested 1.6 liter diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to its torque of up to 300 Nm very powerful in wide speed ranges. However, it should do its work a little more quietly. The everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing. There is another engine: a 1.5-liter petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp. All-wheel drive is not offered. The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort. However, the steering could be a bit more direct. The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive". The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works up to a speed of 32), the collision warning system and the lane departure warning system. The collision warning is sometimes irritating because when maneuvering it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects". The high-beam assistant works very reliably. And the intelligent cruise control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary. However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more. Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach. The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order. If you don't want to invest that much, you can get the petrol engine from 20,000 euros and the diesel from 23,000 euros. The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard. With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile car that is suitable for everyday use.
Airline is not liable: falls on the passenger boarding bridge An airline is not liable for a passenger falling on the passenger boarding bridge. Because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical of air traffic, argued the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Az.: 18 U 124/14). The plaintiff fractured his kneecap in the fall. However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court. The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay? Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can definitely be found in the hotel. However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms. In the case under discussion, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation in Turkey. She spent almost the entire vacation in the room. The vacationers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater. The family was of the opinion that the trip had been deficient - and sued the organizer. The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court. The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective. But the organizer only found out about this shortly before the plaintiffs left. Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was fine. According to the verdict, he did not violate his duty to provide information. Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples. The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through contagion among themselves - is part of the general life risk. Only 38 of 691 guests were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violent crimes committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks. The state must react prudently and decisively to the threat of terrorism at the same time. One thing is certain: our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division. We will not begrudge the terrorists this triumph. But if criminals had to leave the country more quickly, that would increase security and also strengthen the population's approval of the refugee policy. De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 general election. He also announced that the security forces would be reinforced "in the mid-four-digit range over several years." Soliciting sympathy for terrorism must again be a punishable offense. Video surveillance is to be improved, and the weapons law is to be amended in such a way that, above all, buying weapons on the Internet is made more difficult. According to de Maizières, the much-discussed confidentiality for doctors should be preserved. However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession as to how the risk to citizens can be reduced, he said with a view to mental disorders, for example. In order to counteract the radicalization of refugees, the minister considers better social care to be necessary. Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people. To track criminals in special areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators. SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security". It is important that the interior minister spoke out clearly against actionism. "That was a slap in the face for the agitators in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke media group (Friday). De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality. He considers a general ban on full veils to be constitutionally problematic. You can't ban everything you oppose, and I oppose wearing the burqa. One could talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court. Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate vigor and the ability to act with new anti-terror packages. Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Brisk slogans and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the feeder road Traffic jams regularly on the bypass - here is a picture from November. But that is about to change: the right turn lane is to be extended. This is good news for all motorists who get stuck in traffic jams on the surrounding road every evening during rush hour when they drive via the feeder road (A 43). Next Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16/17), the state road construction agency will extend the right turn lane by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Strasse and the Weseler Strasse exit. Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße. The big advantage: The traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the federal highway 51. The idea of the extended exit came from the CDU parliamentary group in the Münster-West district council. The narrowing of the lane on the feeder annoys drivers, especially between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. On weekdays, the backlog reaches as far as the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond. The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the Weseler Straße exit. From here, traffic is only directed in one lane over the motorway bridge. The second lane had to be dismantled a good eighteen months ago. The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate heavy goods traffic in two lanes. The responsible state office cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated daily traffic jam will last. However, years are to be expected: because the official remaining useful life of the bridge is up to 2034. The state authority deliberately chose the quieter time of the school holidays to extend the right-hand turning lane because obstructions are to be expected. Traffic will be guided past the construction site in one lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House". The association Nima's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project. The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster. The "International Class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Junges Theater Münster. In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 schoolchildren between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production in the Little House. Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of culturally integrating young people with a migration and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project. Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German. Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was still possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster. The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel and the Junges Theater will be working together on a music theater project in the coming season. From October to December, young people between the ages of 14 and 20 with and without a refugee or migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally instructed courses in singing, dancing, acting and music. Offers for children and families in the field of theater and theatrical language teaching are being planned. The "Intercultural Journey" project continues. In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to want to take part.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement The weather put a spanner in the works for those looking for shooting stars in south-west Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope. The night was badly suited to observing the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning. Our hope is on Saturday night. The weather should be good, then we will definitely see a lot of shooting stars in the sky. The star scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour. They got their name because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
A good night's rest: tips to prevent insomnia In the evening you toss and turn, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't even think of sleeping long before the alarm clock rings. This is anything but relaxing. After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel their sleep is not restful. How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves? There are several forms of sleep disorders and they can have a variety of underlying causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine. What is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a difficulty falling asleep and sleeping through the night. Many people find sleeping through the night unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Association of General Practitioners with a practice in Varel, Lower Saxony. What is behind sleep disorders? The causes of insomnia are complex. This can be due to organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also to medication. It is not uncommon for the sleep disorder to be an expression of another illness. "Waking up very early is common, especially in the case of depression," says Weeß. And it may be that different factors are mutually dependent. For example, someone who has a herniated disc can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example. This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible. When should you see a doctor about insomnia? Weeß recommends that anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is impaired during the day should see a doctor. The impairment can look very different: You are exhausted, tired, not enough sleep, have difficulty paying attention and concentrating, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach ache or headaches. In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes. Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks. There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin. That's why you should first contact your family doctor if you have problems sleeping, advises Weeß. He or she can use examinations to determine whether the problems have a physical cause. Who should go to the sleep laboratory and what happens there? Doctors recommend examinations in the sleep laboratory, for example, in the case of snoring with breathing pauses, pathological daytime tiredness, sleepwalkers or if you cannot find the cause of a difficulty sleeping through the night, explains Fietze. You don't really need to prepare for the exam. You should spend the day normally. "Just please don't take a nap," says Fietze. After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time. In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nasal cannula, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger. In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person. How can those affected get the problems under control? There are quite a few parameters that you can use to improve your sleep. Weeß lists: Regular sleeping and getting up times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate straight away, and that's really and not beneficial at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing swimming medals The former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis. In December 2014 he won gold for the first time at the short course world championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record. Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his criticized ex-teammates via Facebook. "In a country where an Olympic champion gets a bonus of €20,000 and a king of the jungle €150,000, nobody should be surprised at the lack of medals," wrote the 26-year-old on Friday night on his Facebook page. The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good. We can't compete with countries that fund a lot and don't look very closely at the issue of doping or even practice it. "I'm not saying that the controls should be discontinued here," he continued. If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered with the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first start. That's exactly how it should be with countries. “Anyone who cannot be checked by independent WADA/FINA inspectors a certain time before WM/OS is not allowed to participate,” demands the Hamburger by choice, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport Civil investigators from the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 on Thursday. The suspects had committed multiple pickpocketing and luggage thefts as a gang. Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officers in the Düsseldorf Airport area recognized a gang that the police officers knew from previous thefts. The two women and two men had committed several offenses since mid-July of this year and had acted together, working collaboratively and in a particularly professional manner. The specialists of Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four crimes committed by the thieves, who had traveled to Germany specifically to commit crimes. They had stolen a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, and a bit of cobblestones in between: Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" in the city. Walking down the street from east to west, you'll pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food store. Someone wrote "ugly!" on the facade of a gray house. sprayed. Construction is already underway across from a Lidl, which is also due to be demolished soon: by 2017, a building with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here. Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, have been illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks. The reason for this is house number 94: it was once occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but rooms on the ground floor are still occupied and used for events. Berlin's interior senator Henkel, in particular, has repeatedly spoken out in favor of tough police action against the project since the beginning of the year, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence. According to official statements, after the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been vacated by 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled the site for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three police vans, blocking parts of the street and preventing visitors from to enter the house with the number 94. Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners. On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left to cheers from sympathizers and local residents. On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with children, people are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting in front of the late afternoon tea. A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects. Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence. They share concerns about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the housing projects. It doesn't sound like a neighborhood where the majority would like police protection from left-wing vandals. The rift that the Berlin Interior Senator and the police are opening up between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist. Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district that still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city. Squatting and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the neighborhood: In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were squatted, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse very close to Rigaer. While the Mainzer was evacuated in a regular street battle with a large police presence, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and some are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago. At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners by choice from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR era and former squatters now share their neighborhood with them. This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals. Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: You can recognize them by smashed windows or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with paint bags. No other street was mentioned so often with the words "left-wing autonomous violence" this year. One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: According to statistics, crimes such as bodily harm are almost exclusively directed against police officers. The majority of criminal offenses are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses. For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in an apartment building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty. As far as acts of violence are concerned, she is reassuring: the people in 94 are her neighbors, they certainly weren't. The famous burning cars have not existed directly in Riga for a long time. For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal hotspot, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get to know each other more than anywhere else". Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Strasse - and stayed. That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the district in July. But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former vacant lots that are crowding out the old residents. "Ultimately, these are condominiums that aren't of interest to many here - people tend to live here who aren't that well off," she says. "I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction." But what are you supposed to do if nobody ever listens to you? Frustration sets in on all sides, including the police and the residents. Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are annoyed by color bombs: the housing projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the neighborhood. Anyone moving here should be aware of this - just like someone moving to a bar district can hardly complain about the noise there. All persons presented only with their first names have asked not to be called by their real names
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer Annika Deuschle is the contact person for matters of integration and organisation. She is also a local social worker. Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July. The social worker supports the administration team led by Achim Grockenberger. She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, the refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved. Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the all-rounder who has one problem above all. That's what some had said - not so much mockingly as aiming at the large number of desired areas of responsibility - when the administration wanted to advertise the position. We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, a jack of all trades. But administrative work is not her main area, says Annika Deuschle. Above all, it's about organization, working with the people on site and behind the scenes, and networking. The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks. She has a 50 percent position limited to three years. "It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported voluntary and full-time actors. There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems. New containers will soon be in Wasenstraße. For some time now, finding apartments for refugees who have been accepted to join them has been a serious problem. The municipalities are responsible for the subsequent accommodation. They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters. The municipalities have to bear the costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations themselves. Responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center. Problem: There are vacant properties, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment. The search has been proving very difficult for some time. In fact, the administration cannot find any private apartments. It hasn't worked so far, one is dependent on private apartments, says Deuschle. Therefore, municipal housing must be upgraded, as the saying goes. So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße. But just apartments are not enough. Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree. In addition to a permanent place to stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up. "More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde. Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do community work - and that motivates and very properly, as Annika Deuschle reports. She hopes that community service will have a positive impact. This is "not occupational therapy". However, activity does not just mean work. The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Kunde. People need to develop a sense of belonging. So there is a need for offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses. Professional courses are rare. So here, too, the administration and volunteers step in. It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany. The length of the process is a problem. You have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses. Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that they cannot help anyone in Urbach, are not allowed to work and are useless will never integrate. The clear majority are motivated. But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people who don't work at all". The work of Deuschle and Kunde is therefore always about motivating others. All of this is a "mammoth task". A difficult question: after the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach? "No," says Regine Kunde very clearly, "what some may call naïve." However, she cannot and does not want to rule out a residual risk. But the helpers are already sensitized. These incidents are also an issue for the refugees. They were afraid that the assassins would bring them into complete disrepute. "They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde. Many would like to stay in Urbach. So employees and volunteers have to be on the lookout for jobs on site and in the region. They always have in the background that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach. Does Germany need an upper limit? Politicians are reluctant to give a clear answer to this question. It's actually unfair to give them to local helpers. "In Urbach we haven't gotten where we want to be yet," says Annika Deuschle. No new refugees, that would ease the situation. Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy trying to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way. There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men. But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree. The world political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Helicopter searched for burglars The police helicopter flew around different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully. Two unknown men broke into an apartment in an apartment building on Lindenweg around 8:50 a.m. on Friday morning. The resident surprised the two and put the fiends to flight. The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies. They fled downtown. The police used several patrol crews and a police helicopter to search for the suspect. The search was unsuccessful. The strangers may have been noticed before the crime near the apartment or during their escape.
