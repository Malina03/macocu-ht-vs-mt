28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall. The victim's brother testified that he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, "He finally got better." The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Coroner's Department said. The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing. The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, landed his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago. A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death. "We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him dearly," the rep continued. Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time. Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally started to pick up for him." "He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO. Louis Galicia said that he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm his younger brother. He was a kind person with a big heart. His way of connecting with his family was always cooking us something, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said. He never wanted to get into any kind of argument. He was the brother who went with the flow. "Everything "What's wrong with the world, he was this diamond in the rough that shone brightly every day," he said. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call the SFPD hotline at 415-575-4444.
Residents on strike: Demands for new industrial action Residents' representatives have called on their union to approve new industrial action over their dispute over a new contract. The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its full council to authorize more industrial action from early September. JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty. Residents and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA. It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections. In a letter to members posted to Twitter Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently quiet" on issues, leading to the deal being rejected. She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract outright and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns." In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action beginning in early September. The disputes led to six strikes by resident doctors this year, the first total blackouts in NHS history. The head of the BMA resident physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA. He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the 54,000 interns and medical students voted, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted. After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"? It was a gesture that ended a crisis. The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions. But as Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the Gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot help but get the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most. There was the handshake, yes. But Putin's smile was tight-lipped and he barely exuded warmth, even by his reserved standards. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his "dear friend" Putin - according to one report, a total of five times. I couldn't count anymore. He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but would even improve. The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened. His enthusiasm seemed to me to indicate the opposite. But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian head of state had forgotten nothing. Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border. Moscow's reaction at the time was furious. Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Russia in the back. The offense was even greater since it was committed by an assumed friend. Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible. Public opinion in Russia has changed since November. For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, all-out assault on Ankara. Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything. Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State. He has vehemently denied this. But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead. After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan. Russia was able to record a kind of victory. For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious. First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly impeached in a failed coup last month. Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him. But there are also economic motives. Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard -- particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring tens of millions of Russian tourists to Turkey's shores each year. The number has decreased by almost 90%. In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume. They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean. This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkey's agricultural imports are allowed again. A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists this way, tomatoes this way." But the visit had additional political value for Moscow. Ankara is furious with the West, considering its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response. Add to that lingering resentment at the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to capitalize on the cool mood and dilute Turkey's relationship with the West. The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for elected officials after the attempted coup. Mind you, this is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change. The summit meeting in this glamorous seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries, rejected and mistreated by the West, who are now joining forces. However, despite the public reconciliation, major differences still exist between the two. The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides. It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject. Turkey's President purposely avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it. There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria. But after months of open hostilities -- and given the potential for complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet -- it's certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back-office role. The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland. Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions. The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out. During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands. She has supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship for everything from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. But now she has decided to focus more on national brands. The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialised. In England and Wales all RSB credentials, decentralized headquarters and stock exchange listing will move to NatWest. The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There are other, smaller retail banking brands that will gain more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank. McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire. He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our staff will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands." As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand. I will now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals. Each of these brands will represent something entirely different in their own communities, and our associates will work with clients under those brands. RBS has previously said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship. "It's time for us to evolve into the bank of brands because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO. It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands. But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes. We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori takes his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that gives him 3,000th win Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday. He set a milestone on Predilection, coached by John Gosden, at his local circuit with his second win of the night. The 45-year-old Italian becomes the sixth jockey to reach the flat racing milestone. He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson. Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special." I'm very emotional because my family is here too. I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago. It's not a big gathering, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people. I am relieved and very humble. Dettori takes part in the celebrations as he takes victory on Predilection Two jockeys have reached the Steeplechase milestone - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has amassed more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career. Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories Frankie is one of the finest jockeys of modern times and it's no surprise that he has achieved a milestone few have achieved before him. He has style and strength, but it's his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the rest of the weight control room. He's a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years. I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he wasn't just a weekend and major tournament jockey he would have already won 6,000! Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years which is great. He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but he's also an incredible jockey. Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a signature Flying Dismount From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British flat racing for two decades. It was nerve wracking. A string of major tournament wins, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban. He initially struggled three years ago when he returned from a six-month ban, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and get back to his best. And he's far from finished - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he's at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin Fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov. Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years. The 63-year-old has been appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters. A Kremlin statement said Putin "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as head of Russia's presidential administration" without giving reasons. Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat. Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo. The Kremlin's website states (in Russian) that he later served as chief of protocol and chief of staff of government staff. About his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust." I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state in drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your directives. Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor. Are the smiling faces convincing? This step made Moscow shrouded in mystery. Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB. As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country. At a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff was resigning of his own volition. But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, with the general election approaching. So is this the result of some kind of power struggle? Nobody knows at the moment. But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - was met with widespread skepticism. In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in an interview in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated - one could almost say - arduous post for four years "It turns out I've been the head of Russia's presidential administration for four years and eight months. Ivanov took the post in December 2011. Previously he was deputy prime minister and defense minister. He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB state security service In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most. It was once assumed that Ivanov would become President of Russia after Putin's second term k because a third term for Putin would have been unconstitutional. But that post was filled by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev. Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.

Mystery surrounding fish that ended up in Banff yard A Banff resident asked for help identifying the fish that turned up in his Banff yard. Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sandeels spat out of a fountain. Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now linked to Fife The £1.35bn project is due for completion by May 2017 Engineers have linked the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now linked to Fife. It is the first of four "deck fan" closures nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers. The Fife bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes. It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 stay cables. The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017. Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was among the first to move from land to the bridge. He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing. We are all witnessing an engineering feat of truly epic proportions on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used on this part of the bridge alone. Despite Due to the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.Overall, nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place and the final section of the deck is in place Received a concrete deck pour today at Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.Michael Martin, Project Manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant one on any bridge project Milestone. In this fantastic project, the closure represents the future of high and Civil Engineering. After installing the final road deck section and connecting it to the north tower deck under construction, we then had to close the gap that still existed on the north or land side. This was accomplished by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south. This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity. Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a gradient of around 3%. Tricky as the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - just a few millimeters on each side. Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men 'lucky to be alive' Three men 'lucky to be alive' after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey. The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the incident in Moelfre Bay. The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat proceeded under its own power. "We saw the boat spinning near them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre Rescue Station manager Vince Jones. "Fortunately, by the time we launched, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of their reach," he added. Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket. They all boarded the inshore lifeboat and were taken back to the lifeboat station. Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are fortunate to be unharmed and alive. The boat's engine had an emergency lanyard but it came loose got rid of the person steering the boat when the boat capsized Someone was watching over these men today.
Pokémon Go, a pursuit of health and happiness well worth it Watching the world change is fascinating. The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade. Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and more active. Screen time was initially limited to television, then video games, and most recently smartphones. So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities aren't mutually exclusive. I'm referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later to become an animated series, game cards, and other spin-offs). Like many pop culture phenomena, interest waned somewhat ahead of the game's release in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July. The launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers. Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter. How does it work? In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured". A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped off the sofa in search. In the US, the game resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps the "average" person takes each day. Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people being tracked exercising 30 minutes each day increased from 45 percent to 53 percent started. The company doesn't know which of these is playing Pokémon Go - it's just seeing the raw performance boost data. Many public health education campaigns that try to get people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the couch," "get off the couch," and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and by people come who look miserable. However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated. Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression. Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here. But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy. This covers three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun. Some people even make new friends while hunting. As always, there are grumpy spoilsports who always have something to complain about. And yes, someone could walk into a door. What the hell? A breakthrough has occurred. While smartphone apps like Fitbit used to be able to track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does. The new will lose its appeal and use will diminish over time. However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier. read dr Joe's blog at www.drjoetoday.com
Simone Biles Takes Gold in Women's Gymnastics Forget the pressure. Forget the hype. Simone Biles is immune to all of this. Dynamic on the jumping horse. Effortlessly on the beam. Stunning on the floor. Brilliant across the board. And now finally Olympic champion. The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympics. Her overall score of 62.198 was well ahead of silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina. America's Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the Women's Individual All-Around Final in Artistic Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday. Biles is the fourth straight American to win an all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, if not ever. She burst into tears as her final score was revealed and her long journey came to an end at that moment. That achievement puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights: Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with routines such amazing that it's a mixture of Ambition and precision mean that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she was "the best gymnast I have ever seen." A final test awaited her in Brazil, a competition that wasn't so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes as between her and a burden of overblown expectations. Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be seen as disappointing. America's Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning respectively gold and silver in the women's individual all-around final in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, while Biles clinched the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi. Although Biles insisted that she never planned for the future during her long journey to the top, that's not really true. Some of her floor routines - which include her signature tumbling pass - are set to Latin music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympics arena. This is no coincidence. Adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, this girl became a force. She hasn't lost an all-around since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes. Even though Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was deceptive. Balance beam and floor exercise - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked. She caught up again with a 15.433 on the balance beam - and followed that up with a 15.933 on the floor. Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited their end result - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Bile's glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became a reality. Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak. This time, the 22-year-old team captain, nicknamed "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start. After her floor exercise, she blew kisses to the audience, blown away by a comeback that at times seemed dubious. As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week took on a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in car According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case, while they talked in the car and listened to music. Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said. The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report reads. Police said the triple murder does not appear to have been the result of a robbery as the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 belonging to one of the adult victims. Phoenix Police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks. In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks over a four-month period, mostly in Hispanic neighborhoods. "It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month. The suspect is believed to have used multiple vehicles, including a brown late 1990's Nissan, a black late 1990's BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln. Investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer. Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later passed away. Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot. A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music. Authorities also released a police report of the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, believed to be the serial killer's work. Investigators found cartridge cases and secured a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mom of 6-Year-Old with Microcephaly: "It's Getting Better" Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother. But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of while pregnant. When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this. I can not do this. I didn't get involved with that. Which is not at all true -- of course it was agreed to," she said. Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive. Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him."My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" Picciuto explained. Edmund can walk with the help of a walker. Edmund couldn't sit or sit until he was three years old crawling and he still can't speak. But he's slowly making progress. He can walk and ride a bike with assistance. He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers. Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund thinks of for "Please sing something in front of me." "We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News. But it's not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters on his own. Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, such as Edmund, and viral infections, such as measles or Zika virus, during pregnancy. Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely. It's too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus. Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future. I kept asking what will happen? What will happen? And she still doesn't really know. I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to tell me. But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus. It gets better. You know things will get better for you. You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods prompt rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain is expected throughout Saturday. Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks, threatening widespread flooding after heavy rains, the National Weather Service reported. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is on the way to affected communities. Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were mounting. Steele said the Tangipahoa community alone requested 10,000 sandbags. A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana through Saturday. The weather service said the area could get an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain. A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday while rain continued in the Mobile area. The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to hit record levels over the weekend. Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge. He also said that downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will be slow to flow into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers. The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on record as early as 9 a.m. Friday. Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwest Mississippi. Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday. Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight. He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him. "We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," said Hansford. It reached my waist. His wife told Hansford that she had never seen the river so high in the 48 years she lived there. Hansford said that he and his family members all have disabilities and that he is the only one who can swim. Hansford said emergency responders rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were being held until Friday. Krautmann said the flooding "spread quickly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders. According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight through Friday morning. Krautmann said the ground had been significantly soaked by the rains since Wednesday. Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and canceled classes in five school districts. CBS affiliate WWL reported that a clerk in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes. Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded. Community leader Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters. Temporary shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees. "Once the water starts to recede, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said. In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa Township, nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to flooding and sandbags have been made available for residents hoping to keep the water out of their homes and businesses. "The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city council. This appears to be a similar incident. In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast. He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported as of Friday. Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years. "I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, 'riddled with bullets' survives Philadelphia shooting Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old has been shot. The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia. The grandparents stated that Brown sustained multiple gunshot wounds, including to the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital. "He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster. I just can't believe it. The boy's condition was classified as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo multiple surgeries. The boy's family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover. He should have started first grade at a local elementary school. Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown. Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old. One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia. The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the broadcaster reports. The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether the perpetrator could be underneath one of the injured men. Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be crossfire between multiple shooters. Assault rifle shell casings, traced to various assault rifles, littered the crime scene. It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle. There were pods on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk. So there appear to have been several gunmen here who were very actively involved," Philadelphia Police Constable Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the broadcaster. Several homes and vehicles in the area were also hit. No arrests were made and police were not involved is reportedly reviewing surveillance video On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a ricochet while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.She is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie This is what I envision the women's Olympic gymnastics team to be, and for more reasons than one. First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant. Second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspirational to many young girls of different races. The structure of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud. This team finally reflects the USA. It has solidified the Black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport. For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American. Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2. That shows strength. At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered. Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines. On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in a women's individual all-around event. Team member Aly Raisman won silver. We're seeing the pinnacle of this sport, but that's not what gymnastics classes look like across the country. Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team. They are the "bottom five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts on the team. Also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach. But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily work in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued at will. The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business. It is in these clubs that the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families. Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics. We need to make gymnastics training more affordable and accessible to the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie. I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago. At my events, we've provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and coached national and international champions. In September we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to bring quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport. Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind. This combination offers lifelong benefits for health, academic success, and professional success. It's the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great. It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls. This is such an exciting time. Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true display of "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold and thank you for getting so many young girls from all backgrounds motivated to start their journey, healthy, strong and successful to become young women.
Residents want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal Ministers had hoped to settle disputes over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 residents who voted in an election voted, rejected it. In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract into effect, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be harmful for staff and patients. The first residents are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable hours. Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of BMA's Resident Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: "Residents continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly ." With just eight weeks left before the first batch of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out. Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have met with government reluctance to participate and at times a deafening silence. That was on a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month about his door always being open. "Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, end the enforcement and address the concerns of residents." Should he fail to do so, the interns have made it clear that they stand ready to pursue further industrial action. The latest strike in late April saw the delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line. Ministers had hoped to settle disputes over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with British Medical Association officials. The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 residents who will be subject to the contract. Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged residents to end the strike. Mortimer said, "Industrial action achieves little, but strains already stretched teams and providers and causes only worry, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families." Over the past two months we have spoken to the Residents Committee and responded positively to the concerns of guardianship and whistleblowing with the Department of Health and other departments. Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career sabbatical, training costs, mutual recognition of curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine Signs of this were how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honoring the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that may reduce heart attack risk Thousands of heart attack sufferers will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to more people for a longer period. The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeat heart attacks for people with heart disease. The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack. NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems. NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems. Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of those suffer another heart attack or stroke. Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fatty material in the walls of the arteries, which causes plaque. If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, thereby causing a heart attack. If the blood clot breaks loose, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one. Ticagrelor, made by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots less likely to form. NICE's draft guidance, released today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg with twice-daily dosing of aspirin for the next three years. Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences." Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life. Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack. By tentatively recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit. Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of political correctness fuels voter fraud in Muslim areas Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on a government report on corruption charges A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored as a scathing government report revealed today. Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has verbally attacked the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse based on "racial and religious sensitivities". The former integration and local government minister, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should be allowed to set up barrier tape outside voting booths to protect intimidated voters. He recommends that voters should carry ID to prove their identity at elections. Currently, a voter only has to give their name and address. The report suggests putting permanent ink on a person's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice. Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric. He demands that the press should have more access to community records and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups. "This is not only to combat voter fraud, but also to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said. The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London. Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be impeached after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices. The court found that Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia. Rahman is said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him." Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of impersonation, where one person votes as someone else. Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country. He was particularly alarmed about fraudulent postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice. Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including carrying ID cards to prove identity. His report reads: "Evidence has been put forward of pressure being exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly Women and young people to vote according to the will of their elders, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background." There have been concerns that... state institutions knowingly engage in such behavior due to "politically correct" racial and religious oversensitivities ignored." Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing absentee ballot records to stop "election harvests". The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for tougher registry checks , to prevent the election directory to Immi ration and social fraud purposes. Consider options to ask voters for their ID before voting. Using permanent ink on a person's finger once they've cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice. Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote. A three-year limit on applications for an automatic vote-by-mail. Prohibited political activists from editing complete mail-in ballots and mail-in ballot envelopes. Give the police the power to set up cordons around polling stations. A change in the law that eases a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983. Photography ban in polling stations. Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales). Intensifying training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters enter the polling booth alone. Sir Eric falls for the Metropolitan Police and finds it 'amazing' that no criminal charges have been brought in the wake of the Tower Hamlets case. "The electoral court has found Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit on a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said. He was found guilty on a number of counts, sufficient to meet the high standards of criminal justice. He also criticizes the ineffective "check-off checks" by the voter-registration departments in city halls. Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets court ruling was a red flag. Our country has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens that reputation.
Mad about Kate's cyclist lookalike and other famous Rio Olympics lookalikes Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been furious this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has turned out to be an impressive lookalike of the Duchess of Cambridge. But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-winning athlete to sport his own famous look-alike this summer - at least not according to social media. In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are flickering on our screens these days, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities. The Hunter and the Wolf: US archery teammate Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood In addition to Kate's velodrome double, many people online have pointed out how a certain archer is the twin of A-listers Leonardo DiCaprio could be. US archery teammate Brady Ellison has caused a flurry on Twitter after pictures surfaced in which he looks eerily like the Wolf of Wall Street star. In fact, the archer caught the craze on social media and admitted he's been told he looks like Leo since he was a kid. "I don't see a huge resemblance myself, other than facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post. "He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment." One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will no doubt draw even more attention this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris. Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan. And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years. Up a gear: This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor Another ongoing comparison has been made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who sport similarly heavy eyebrows and lips. Russian silver-medal swimmer Yulia Efimova sports more than actress Annalynne McCord's tanned skin and blonde hair, while American Nathan Adrian has been dubbed by fans as "an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt." Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities Theory put in the room: loud There May Be a Reason for the Couple's Resemblance One Twitter user expressed satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical." In fact, US soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes. Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile nearly identical to actress Laura Linney's, and gold medalist gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who sports her own beautiful, wide smile similar to Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig' Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of CBC's live broadcast of the Olympics Wednesday Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went out like shit" and "died like a pig" during the race. Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off as he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay. MacDonald, who had been brought on board to add more "color" to the CBS commentary team, could be heard saying, "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby." Too excited, went off like fug, died like a pig. Thanks for that. Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swimming relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China. Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and language Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'???? The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air." Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final of the women's 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay: "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl has lost touch, baby." The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many taking him to task Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was. Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow #ByronMacDonald . You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all look like racists #disgusted A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast." It was unfortunate wording, we're sorry it happened." CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to people who responded to the Noted via Twitter Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald. CBC copied and pasted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who commented on who had complained about MacDonald's comments, the network was also quick to apologize and issue a statement. We sincerely regret that these statements were made and allowed to be broadcast. We quickly apologized to our on-air viewers and our followers on social media last night. To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance and not about her as a person. However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said. On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying he did not mean it to be construed as a personal attack. "I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming relay on the CBC Olympics show, he said. "I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person "Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Primark shoppers outraged by woman shamelessly trying on underwear in middle of store Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off her clothes to try on panties in the middle of a Primark. To make matters worse, she checked out how she looked in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf. She continued browsing and tried on four pairs of knickers in a shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone. The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone where the woman tried on the briefs before putting them back on the shelf A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman who tried on underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything." She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw." Standing in the middle of the store, she grabbed a pair of panties from the display, took off her own tights and pants, and tried them on. "She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar." "Everyone stared as she took off the panties, which she obviously didn't like as she put them back on the shelf." She repeated the same thing with three more panties before finally deciding she didn't like anything, getting dressed and walking outside. "She didn't seem bothered that someone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the panties she tried on." Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think someone would take home panties that someone else was wearing that hadn't been washed." The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Davidson added: "I understand the staff tried to pull the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as well." "I would hate to go home with a new pair of knickers and find out that another woman had them on and took them off and they weren't washed." A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at our Folkstone store on Tuesday 9th August." All eligible products have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks with Krav Maga The outside world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer for you. We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range. Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your predator. When approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi. Then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow. Then knee him in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker doubles in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while aiming the gun at him. For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't fire. Simultaneously shift your weight onto the weapon and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of their grip before backing up and pointing the weapon at them. Sound difficult? Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi demonstrates it. But remember, unless you're a Krav Maga grandmaster, handing over your money is the safest thing to do during a robbery.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for a guidebook A British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places. Suffolk presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, scraped his strokes on a euro note, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system. Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's about to get into. But the experiment, filmed as The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, unearthed some surprising results. The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may seem utterly repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink. Traveling Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about supporting gut bacteria and his own health. Luckily, nothing he licked off left more than a bad taste in his mouth. Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world eating weird and wonderful things. From public railings at train stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely tested his immune system. In the film he says: "Ever since I was a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I would put all sorts of things in my mouth, Earth, worms and muddy water." In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation. The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia. His swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units. In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60. But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60, according to Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows bacterial counts in different places like the bathroom. In the film he says: "This comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." There's nothing dirtier than that! I won't lick anything in here because it's gross in here. "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio. The company supplies Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help boost gut bacteria and the immune system. Valio's Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new. Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics. We ran crazy brainstorms that ended with, that we said "Let's call Ian." They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system. The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way. I also think the film shows for having a great sense of humor!Tom Hakala who is directing the film e, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet featured in the film ." Of course, there were things that were easier to get Ian to lick her and others that were quite difficult to do. I'm glad we got some of those dirty treats on film." In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with gastrointestinal well-being and 58 percent said they at least occasionally Use products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.
Antisocial family vandalize council housing before evictions in Saltash, Cornwall An antisocial family evicted their council housing with £50,000 damage after evictions for terrorizing their neighbours. Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints. After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing association workers found the property in an irreparable state. There were gaping holes in the walls, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was strewn on the floor and graffiti was scrawled on the walls. The family have been relocated and are believed to be living in private accommodation now Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the flat would be beyond repair. She said: "It's been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people have to live that way. There are a lot of things to consider as this property will probably be seen as a not so pretty part of Cornwall. The Family is notorious and so is their reputation.The couple had three sons who lived in the home at one point and police said the terror inflicted by the family included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug dealing and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was issued with an antisocial behavior order in June.Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished. in which drugs were trafficked in the past, the wooden floorboards torn up Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and agitated Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily after the police had to be called. The evictions were cheered by relieved neighbors, who said their lives had been made hell. One testified: "They cared about nobody." We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad. The countless times we tell the police here is unbelievable. "We couldn't sleep this morning." We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that! Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be nice. Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's Neighborhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities. The family lived in the house, to which police were periodically called, for 20 years. Trash and old toys were dumped on the overgrown side of the community center. He added: "It's a shame the tenant failed to take any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family as eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing considers This was a very difficult case as the behavior was extreme and her actions must have been horrible for her neighbors to witness I guess all the work that has been done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have bravely reached out and shared the information with us I hope this development will bring some comfort to some neighbors and the Message conveyed that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated Fitzpatrick said all three sons died at different times s lived in the house, but that they were all in their 20s. A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evictions Property management workers will now have to clear piles of rubbish surrounding the house In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis and scales, Paraphernalia and cash totaling £1,700. Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to trade. She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013. Having been homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth. Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti. Police say they will evict tenants who do not obey the house rules Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who did not obey the house rules. "This goes out to those who feel they can behave without self-blame and to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said. Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior who will continue to work with partners to keep our communities safe.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet flies over beach Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal got the shock of their lives A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane performed an incredible dive The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk This was the moment terrified tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet swooped over a crowded beach. Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within arm's reach over sunbathers on the stretch of beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal. Vacationers jumped when they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming their way through the clouds. The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro. Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It flew by really really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash." Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me." Tourists on Aveiro beach panicked as the plane emerged from the darkness and flew impossibly low The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that it was the only way to see them. The spokesman said the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force insisted safety was never compromised. Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer, also killing four people on the island of Madeira. The Portuguese Air Force said today that the conditions - heavy fog and smoke from the fire - required the pilot to fly so low, which limited his visibility The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join ISIS last year, has reportedly died in Syria. Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago. She was suspected to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday. Sultana was 17 and died shortly after planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England, according to her family. "One can only hope that the only good thing in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - is to prevent people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said . In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus bound for the Syrian border. Sultana's family have been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid is confident that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since Barack Obama's nomination in March. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next President will name the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty." A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating. He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate. Garland is the Chief Justice for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Raid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were lackeys and accomplices of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. He also noted that Donald Trump was unfit for the presidency.
Treats Wants Nude Calendars For 'Women And For Men' Treats magazine has teamed up with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired 2017 calendar. But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar. Treats Editor-in-Chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differed from old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men." I do this for women. Apparently he thinks the calendar does too. "We need to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release accompanying the calendar's release. Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful piece of art. Models can submit their images online or in person to open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Destination records: who actually buys records? Lonely middle-aged men love records. Before you rush to the comments section to pelt him with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement is derived from actual data. According to YouGov, the much-discussed vinyl resurgence isn't due to a boom in millennials wanting to embrace the news of physical objects, but rather to midlife nostalgia. Those who have recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54. In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely group of buyers. It's not hording by hobbyists either - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%). But are YouGov's results correct? If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, holding my hands and saying something definitive like, "So, let's take a closer look." So, let's take a look. Though the heart of Soho is losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that once housed independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops. I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to gauge their ages and tempers through observation. Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, believed to be in her 20s) is out for a day due to a Meet in London and browse the shops to fill the few hours. Is he a collector I ask? "I guess so," he says. I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records. These vinyl records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room. The reason he owns such a substantial number of albums and singles is as a result of his disposable income: he's now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they came out and again buy items that he sold when he was young and broke. "A lot of things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which came out when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a bit too young to buy," he says. He agrees that those who buy records tend to be more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. It's my vice. Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile, however he has also noticed a new wave of people being influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and feel compelled to do so again to buy their old records.From the conversations I've had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999. Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to to buy their records again," he says. That would explain the boom in adherents of the record revival of a certain age. But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records? It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comforting community of like-minded people. According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system. Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and wish to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, objects that evoke happy childhood memories. "I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as a form of comfort," says Wez. It's the same for me as a collector and I think it's the same for a lot of people. It's an easy way to keep yourself mentally engaged. "We are like their social workers!" an employee flutes from a stack of records. A poll by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record in the last month haven't listened to it. The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player. At this point in the news report, I would probably be looking very concerned while flipping through a stack of bossa nova compilations. Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noted a "trophy aspect" of the revival. "Someone just walked in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record to put on the shelf,'" he says. It's not a huge percentage, but it's definitely happening. More product-heavy, less music-heavy. We have people who say, "I don't have a record player." These are younger people, not older ones, who are just starting to get in. Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to records, has a more diverse audience than I go in. There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women, although the vibe is a little less chilled than the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts blasts the latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the clients, none of whom look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to pin down Adjustable by standing next to someone for 30 seconds. Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes looking at the variety of records for sale. She's more window shopping than bulk shopping. She doesn't earn much, so collecting records isn't really an option, she says. It costs a lot. It's easy to listen to music on a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with an amorous sigh. I don't know how to explain - it's really unique. Mine last stop is a store said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.Pretending to study the denim hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls turn around for a moment Polaroid cameras grouped before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley record player To the left is a stairwell, a wall covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection Nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up as to be impossible to touch them. It is pure "record art". But considering that each attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers deep in Soho for more, there's nothing to complain about. It's no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxuries like records. While my research found that YouGov's findings are correct, they fail to take into account, at least in Soho record stores, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores, and on online forums. These people probably work hard at school or in offices. They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings browsing Berwick Street record stores and flipping through records while avoiding the stare of an eerie 30-year-old fake presenter looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet. Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp A French court has rejected an offer by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees. At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued the state should have the power to demolish 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp were selling goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services or offering tea for 50 cents (40p) or sell simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants. The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which posed a fire and sanitation risk. Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals provided by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp. They also said the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for people in need. A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people running the 72 makeshift shops, but conceded that the Calais prefecture's concerns were "perfectly understandable." Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people "living in extremely precarious conditions." He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers. One of the places at risk of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is a non-profit organization offering 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and an asylum counseling center for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp offers. More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the Kids' Café. A letter to the Guardian said the closure "would be disastrous for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old." Two aid organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep surge in new arrivals over the summer.
Great Britain take Silver in Rugby 7s after Fiji Masterclass takes gold Britain's impressive performance in Rugby 7s came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in Thursday night's final as Fiji prevailed as they finished by a score of 43- 7 were beaten at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio. Fiji delivered a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, pushing up, line walking and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour. The loss was sweetened by the not-too-shabby consolation prize of a silver medal - Britain's fourth of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa. The Boks' resounding defeat, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day, could throw them back in the finals. But regardless, on this form, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at their best. It could be some consolation for Britain - but probably won't - that at least one Brit will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon. GB had a difficult road behind it. Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens. Here they only lost one thing. This defeat will hurt, but the progress is amazing. Fiji started beautifully, deflecting GB's attacks for fun. For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. it felt like walking into moving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner. With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner, which he converted. 12-0 and GB barely touched the ball. A superb tackle from Mitchell stopped man Leone Nakarawa's mountain from scoring a third goal, but it only stalled Fiji. In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua landed a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB. Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play left...in the first half. Vatemo Ravouvou blasted through more weak tackles from the GB team and charged to the line to score. The conversion brought a 29-0 by the break. It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning. That's how it is. GB made fundamental changes at half-time, closing the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interplay from Fiji. Dan Norton launched a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long since gone in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans chanted, waved flags and danced in the stands. It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach. Mata Viliame added the icing on the cake with another try in the final seconds. The whistle blew, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked the turf, defeated. Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semifinals and Britain edged out South Africa in a close semifinal match - Britain's conversion of the difference. Kyle Brown put the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with some impressive footwork and scored an under-post goal in the second half. A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-aside team, secured the win - and with it the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row victory by battle with coach's cancer There won't be more emotional gold than these games and that's saying something. From the first stroke of the oar to the last, 220 hard heaves that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa. Even if it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams was all present as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in coxless coxless, the first women in British sporting history to set such a benchmark. Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unbeaten appearance, which is also unprecedented. What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the grace of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph. Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would even survive this day than his cancer was diagnosed. As he said, he was risky. I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did. If you don't, it will spread everywhere. It would have been a pretty bad situation. It changes the outlook a bit. Williams was diagnosed in December 2013. The trio were fortunate that he was able to start his treatment off-season in early 2014, which kept disruption to a minimum, if that is even the right term in such circumstances. I needed money, so I had to get better soon. It was an incentive. I was in the hospital walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would do. This is how it begins. Rowing is a challenge in itself, but that makes it even more challenging. In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears. Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a tour of duty in Afghanistan, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week. It might be a bit extreme, but it means so much." It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much work I and Helen and Robin have done. It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin. We would be nobody without Robin so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world. I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with or a better coach. Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years. The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't match. Even in the last 500 meters, as teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve. We were very caught up in the moment. Helen shouted "Keep the process, keep the process". It's really important not to get carried away. We got off to a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great. We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did. The couple will take a year off before making any decisions about their future. Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own to TV adventurer Steve Backshall. Now she just wants to enjoy the moment. I didn't want to say that this was my last race. That would have meant too much pressure. In London, it took about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion. It was all so new to me and I was so stressed. Here it took about four minutes. It feels so much better," she said.

Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to race. With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd. You can transform into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that could be straight out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting. The filters are blunt, trait-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day. All missteps go public. Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of the app encouraging blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal. When it suggested a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface". They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger issue the company has with diversity. The news and outrage was widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had disabled the feature. The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to pay homage to anime characters, not to caricature Asians. But to outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded them of hurtful stereotypes. Others firmly dismissed the anime comparison. In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least." She added that "It's difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects. It shows that the filter isn't yellow-faced, but that the yellow-faced has been taken to the pejorative extreme. Snapchat isn't the only company crossing those cultural tripwires. American culture seems embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands. And Snapchat's large audience of young people - the more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity. If one of Snapchat's filters produces an image that is offensive to a user, "it's a lot harder for stuff like that to go unnoticed than it used to be ," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday. On Thursday, Zhu made up his mind , who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same. In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices. Criticizing the largely white, all-male leadership, Zhu ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat. "Either they don't have a diverse representation of people of color in their workforce to make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of color who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable, to say something against it." Others share their opinions, a complaint Snapchat has largely left unanswered. The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company. On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but the company recently hired an HR executive to focus on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts, according to a spokesman. For her part, Zhu said she will have her Snapchat account shut down, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not OK."
Military leaders falsify ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee finds Military officials with United States Central Command altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, reports a congressional inquiry committee in a report Thursday. The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Budget Committee, reports widespread discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how senior officials were changing their assessments of America's efforts in the fight against Islamic State. Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida that controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia. "Intelligence information, typically nodded by senior Centcom commanders, routinely painted a more positive picture of American counterterrorism efforts than actual conditions on the ground would have permitted and was consistently more positive than analyzes by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying. "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. Centcom's leadership failures extend to the very top of the organization. The 10-page report details persistent issues in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in training Iraqi forces. While it provides no direct evidence that Obama administration leaders gave orders to alter the reports, it does show, as analysts have faced pressure from their bosses, a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL to draw. "During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and testimonies before Congress were significantly more positive than true," the report noted. For example, a Centcom official publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015. Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under Islamic State control. "After months of investigation, this much is clear." Republican congressman from Kansas Mike Pompeo said in a statement. From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq. Republicans created the task force after being told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports on Islamic State. The report released on Thursday will be supplemented with more detailed findings as the investigation continues. In addition, further investigations into the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Department of Defense are ongoing. Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday, which agreed with some of the Republican task force's conclusions. "In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly constrained process for preparing intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," senior Democrat on the committee, House Member Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement. This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts, and "left inordinately little room for dissent." But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding "particular political opinion." The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast. Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general following complaints from Centcom analysts. Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the inspector general's investigation was ongoing. But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite different opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these important national defense issues." The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials). However, last year's allegations have raised questions about President Obama's ability to rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other troubled regions. Criticisms over Islamic State intelligence recall a dispute more than a decade ago, when Centcom analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a paper about how the then-George W. Bush administration, contrary to many analysts' recommendations, used only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion. Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on Islamic State. Last year, according to government sources, Mr. Hooker's team found that, contrary to what the government said, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial position, as they put makeshift refineries into operation to Selling oil on the black market. However, that finding was not made public, the Times reported in September. Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing. Gen. Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
USA win fourth women's field hockey match, showdown with Great Britain imminent A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the America women's field hockey team in one Match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0. Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement but Bam, 27, said she didn't recall ever doing it. "I have no idea." she said. I'm not one of those people to remember their goals. She does know this, though: the Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and level in their group with first-place Britain, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 win over Japan. Great Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday. Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, and the game will decide who will take first and second place in their group of six teams. The first place will spend a little longer avoiding the strong Dutch women who are leading the other group. Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have caused a surprising stir with their track record, four years after finishing bottom of 12 at the last London Games. Bam was part of that team. Raised in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, she first picked up a hockey stick at age three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University) and became a USA national team player at 16, the youngest in the history of the hockey team teams. She missed the Olympiad in 2008, failing to qualify for the roster. Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team. The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to take a turn for the better. "A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. We didn't have the workload in London that we have now. We were able to completely turn things around. On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a close-range backhand. India went into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprising resilience, keeping the score 1-0 into the third quarter until Bam took control of the game. She sprinted the flat ball down the left flank, then cut in and lobbed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead. Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the last quarter. The shutout was the first of the tournament for USA goaltender Jackie Briggs, who has had a goal in each of her previous games. She's on a roll. Just like Bam. "We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the rage of the Olympics, the zen of the trampoline Wherever you are, whatever the time, it's the Olympics. The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inescapable, a frenzied relay race between competition and pursuit. It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete. You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in line at the coffee shop chat without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos. And then there's Logan Dooley. Dooley, a first-time Olympics and dimpled heartthrob, could well have been among those household names that air prime time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV ads if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer would be. But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampolining. The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally. Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo. We will always have the breaststroke and long may it reign. But if I may humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw your attention to the trampoline's understated charm. Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has received so little attention over the past 16 years that many I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all. That could also be regional ignorance. Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampolining and until 2012 had one athlete make it to the finals. The Chinese and Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for women. Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year. Trampolining has a certain underdog charm, partly because, to the unenlightened ear, it sounds more appropriate for clown school than for the Olympics. At this point, I should admit that I'm no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast. It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremors of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites. The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish el trampoline, which means "springboard." Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, rocketing nearly 30 feet into the air and must complete a series of falling moves (spins, dives, and somersaults) before landing on their feet. According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time". Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio. The most common Olympic vector is straight. Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground in their pursuit of gold. Not only are they chasing the finish line or the exit wall, they are also chasing another taunting target on TV: that of the world or the Olympic record. The single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to bring even a viewer to tears. But it's also what I find a little tiring even while watching these games. The trampoline offers a respite from this. Trampoline jumper vector is up. Forward movement is not the goal. He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up. There is competition here too, not without difficulty, of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on target, no arching into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity. It's as Zen as competition at the Olympics can get. The women's qualifiers and finals will take place Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1 p.m. NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. both days. In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that's likely to be overlooked in the general hubbub. If awareness raising can only be achieved by ogling and objectifying male athletes - as US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his gasping new fan base.
'A generation protests' in Ethiopia, Long a US ally Violent protests in Ethiopia Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have met violent resistance from the government. Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with police. Is Ethiopia about to collapse? Over the past decade it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy. But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas. Last week thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political changes. The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations. Witnesses said police shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators. Videos circulating about the protests, believed to be from last year or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks while they were being forced to do a handstand against a wall. The head of the UN agency for human rights is now demanding an in-depth investigation. "It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project leader of the International Crisis Group, a research group. Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is valued by the West. American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries, if any, in Africa receive as much Western aid. Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace. Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa. The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean. Although Ethiopia has been far from a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently cited the government's repression - opposition in the country has been curbed, with dissidents effectively silenced. Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the vast wilderness. But that could change. "When you suppress people and they have no other option but to protest, it erupts," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. All youth protested. A generation protests. Complaints abound, covering everything from land use to a stranglehold on the ruling coalition's power. After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the opposition's last seat and now control 100 percent of parliament. At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight over that jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June. Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm. Several factors explain why feelings of resentment are exploding beneath the surface after years of simmering. The first seems harmless: smartphones. Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved. Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide their whereabouts. Several young Ethiopians said they gathered this way to protest. The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia. The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies. For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas. But that too is changing. "We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromos leader. The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo areas. Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics. The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi. Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012. He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think outside the box. Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to process opponents and render them harmless. "The current regime lacks these basic skills," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take Mr Meles' position for relatively obscure reasons. Unlike Mr. Meles who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south. Analysts say he is not trusted by the Tigray-controlled security services. Many fear the result will be more bloodshed. The last time Ethiopia saw such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that analysts say appeared to have been botched and subsequently stolen by the government. During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, albeit fewer than in previous months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly. Development experts hailed Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in reducing poverty. But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal grudges. And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form. Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-run businesses and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media. Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in an odd position. The US government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base. While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it doesn't want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area. "This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin line to walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm" Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to defuse the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the " founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, was not meant seriously. This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he would be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public. It also puts his comrades-in-arms, who are trying to defend him during an eventful period, in the odd position of having to explain statements he may not have meant. After making the implication at a campaign rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backtracked on the allegation Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really had no intention of implying that the President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS. But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic. The tweet was in contrast to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was completely serious about the allegation. When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump tone down the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would have none of it. The latest storm of criticism descends on Mr. Trump as he tries to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy over falling polls. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on Michigan's economy this week. On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again. Taking to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would result in higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring. Mr. Trump has already used sarcasm in his defense. In late July he drew strong criticism for suggesting that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, though he later declared "Of course I meant that sarcastically". This method allows Mr. Trump to push the language boundaries in politics and then backtrack as needed. "I think one of his methods is to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they come across, and then if necessary 'clarify' depending on how the reaction is," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who Language of both candidates observed. But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways. Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed a wide lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a neck-and-neck race in Florida. While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor. But as he has increasingly become the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's quips have left his loyal supporters in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be. Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a Thursday interview with CNN. "I believe what he is saying is legitimate political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State. It is true in that sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called them backbenchers, totally wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq. Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by failing to aggressively take control of the situation in the Middle East. Ahead of Friday's campaign rallies in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued to attack the media, accusing them of harping on his every word and being biased against him. He taunted the "poor pathetic" TV pundits who try to understand him, saying, "You can't!". Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just further evidence that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once Knocked Out by Price, Greenpoint Cafe Comes Back Verb Cafe was a seedy, cash-only cafe in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years. Of course, his Bedford Avenue storefront was pushed out by the prices. The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes. Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city. Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel gutted and Verb is now a soap shop." But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention. A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location. The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly understated vibe. The coffee is still good too. The Verb's new owner is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and CEO of the new cafe. He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end. When a client offered to fund a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot. Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model. It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb. But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too. He introduced new ingredients. The menu features bacon and cheese sandwiches and there are toppings like capers and sautéed onions. There are natural rice bowls. The café no longer serves beer, instead there are fresh juices. After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars. "A lot of old customers have also been squeezed out by Williamsburg awards," he said. Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer on a recent Sunday. Oliveira, 34, used to reside in Williamsburg and regularly attended the Verb. Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would make the journey. After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said. "I realized it was the coffee and the culture in Verb that I liked," she said. Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered a blended chai tea, which is another new addition, instead of her usual iced coffee. Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since Verb's inception in 2003. He used to go there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing over and over again. "I'd show up at seven-fifteen, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they make my everything bagel with butter," he said. Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu. These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but he sometimes alternates his everything bagel with bacon, egg, and cheese. Rodriguez said he had no grudges that the soap shop took over the old shop. In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cafe's cold-brew coffee as an ingredient. "I think we'll take a look at their offer," Rodriguez said. And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café. A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to put it out soon so his new neighbors will feel welcome. The location also has other advantages. A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brew coffee. There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building. For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites. Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed. When the new coffee shop opened, Whitt said that stepping inside and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home. "I had to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Eating of the Depression in "One Hearty Meal" In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt lunched in the Oval Office. A foodie, President Roosevelt had a thing for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies like pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup. His menu that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert. "It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering," said Jane Ziegelman. Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat." The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians. Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman's book, 97 Orchard, offers a food perspective on life in a Lower East Side apartment building. Their latest collaboration, A Decent Meal, due out Tuesday from Harper Publishing, chronicles the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression. They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills eatery in the Flatiron District that's been in business since the 1929 stock market crash. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with diced olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple thought it was fitting for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era. "Rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. There was peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread. They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient. Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner. Coe grinned. "It must have settled like lead in the stomach," he said. In the years leading up to the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet. Crews of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways in which the country dealt with no longer being the Land of Cockaigne. "It was a time when food became a hot topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it. Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods like breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unsavory ingredients under a creamy sauce. Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit. Meat, which for years was the focal point of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury. Odd concoctions were tried, as high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common sense. During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter. "It wasn't a popular lunchtime addition," says Coe. Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal." Peanut butter and baked onions don't mix. It was typical of many of the housekeeping recipes. As never before or since, home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - so fueled the country's eating habits. By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and rise to the challenge of turning goo like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals. "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical goodies. Particularly palatable are reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude. While publicly praising his kitchen's simple Iowa farmhouse fare, he ate like the millionaire man of the world he has become. "He liked continental cuisine like fish with pickle sauce," said Coe. He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo. He was delightfully out of touch with reality. President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to make an example with his stomach. As described in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors resulted in the White House producing the most bland food in Washington, but also one of the most dismal prepared." Many of the Great Depression-era species, with Dealing with food was scrapped once the country got back on its feet. The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, said Ziegelman, and how science has been applied to food "She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said. Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick." There was the cream puff incident After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out dessert The one they made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch. "It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that giving humble recipes a fancy name was a common ploy. There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon. Each reluctantly dipped a spoon into the chewy brown goo. Amazingly, it didn't taste bad. Coe grabbed a second helping three times. Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Gilead Receives Legal Fees in Hepatitis C Patent Litigation with Merck A US District Judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover legal fees incurred in the hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc. In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in damages for infringing on two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a US judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including of perjury and other unethical acts. In filing the lawsuit Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to waiver of costs incurred while defending the case. Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of people with the liver disease. The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership over laboratory work involving sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State US-backed forces have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left have said a spokesman for the group on Friday. The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city after extracting the remaining group of fighters who are buried inside the city. They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters. "The city is now under complete control, but we're carrying out a cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%. In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million to charities, primarily to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speaking honoraria; the former secretary of state reported earnings of $3 million from publishers Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department. Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released their tax returns for the past ten years. They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015. "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. In stark contrast, Donald Trump has been hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns. It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so. Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal. "It's your turn," Clinton's campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter in reference to the Democratic presidential nominee's release. Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audit is complete. Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already suggested that his refusal raises questions about wealth, charitable giving, business conduct and various other ties, particularly with Russia. Clinton has already pounced on the issue, posting a video online on Friday in which senior Republicans are urging Trump to release his tax returns. She also addressed the issue during a speech on Michigan's economy on Thursday. "He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades and to publish his tax returns." she said to the crowd. Politico has reported that Trump paid little or no tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist Friday quoted a number of tax attorneys and accountants as saying that that may still be the case. Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign. Clinton supports a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%. President Obama also supports the proposal. During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, invited Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns. Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax audit and that Trump was "scared" of the voters, not the tax authorities. Clinton's campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007. The Clintons, who now reside in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 through 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%. The Clintons' 2015 tax returns showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans. Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons paid $109,000 in dividends and income. With contributions from Kevin Drawbaugh; edited by Jonathan Otis
Condoms filled with chilli powder, firecrackers boost Tanzania's elephant conservation Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to discourage elephants from entering human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chilli powder at them. The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has partnered with US Conservation to step up its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, a four-step non-violent method of protecting their homes and wildlife Harvest to use without harming animals. Previously, many used spears to defend themselves. Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare. "Since we developed the...toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, where they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephants," said the CEO by Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement. The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn. If he is not deterred, what is called a "chilli cloud" is thrown. Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker in a condom, the end of which is twisted up to the fuse. When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying fine dust of chilli powder into the air. A touch is usually enough to chase the elephant away. A final option is a launcher, which shoots a laburnum firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code after 'Arab' request - RT News A French director of Jewish descent unleashed a media furore after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin hasn't listed an Israeli area code because it has Arabic Guests "would have requested" according to one staff member. Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ. During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code. However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room. In 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how is it possible that Israel was eliminated and erased? wrote Lanzman. Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center. The director turned to the hotel reception for an explanation. The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote. The hotel employee said the action was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels." The reason behind it made the director even more angry. "The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the area code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann. The Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung. We were appalled and dismayed by this event. This is really very shameful. The fact that this happened in Germany at this very hotel chain is an even greater shame. That needs no explanation. We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said. The incident caused quite a big reaction on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal. Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "giving in" to alleged requests from Arab guests. "Shame on you," said another post, noting that the hotel, which is on posh Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue. The hotel quickly denied all allegations, calling the incident an "accident" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel. "There was never a direct order not to put Israel on the speed dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying, adding that the country code has now been added.
Police fire tear gas & rubber bullets at protesting Brazilian students Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators. Trouble started when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas. Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans. According to Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be relocated to save money. Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti on walls against interim President Michel Temer. The latest protests came days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly surges to 71% - RT Business With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew 70.9 percent year-on-year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan. Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have become more interested in doing business in the country, the ambassador said. Russian companies are cutting existing ties with Iran, while new firms are poised to enter the market. Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said. He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period increased in 2015 and amounted to $856 million Specifically, Russian imports to Iran surged 91.5 percent to $697 million Russian imports from Iran surged 16 percent to $158 million Trade boom was fueled by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador. Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year. Last year, the Russian mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens. Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia. One could say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said. At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change. "Personally, I can Recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotland's Callum Skinner storms home as Brit wins cycling gold Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night as the British team retained the London 2012 title. The 23-year-old from Glasgow took up the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to nab a win from favorites New Zealand. England claimed a shocking win four years ago while Hoy clinched their fifth of six Olympic gold medals. They repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth place at the Track World Championships in London in March despite Hoy's retirement. The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of starter Jamie Staff. They did so in time when Hindes showed up. Hoy's retirement created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton sought to fill. Skinner was the man they stuck with as they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded. Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round. And the British trio won the duel with gold. Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner held it. A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace. Watching from his position as BBC pundit, Hoy caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they mounted the podium. Skinner, 23, from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison." I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself. We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions. It was amazing. There's no better way to win this. After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoy in 2012, Hindes admitted he fell onto the track on purpose after a poor start. He later retracted this statement and no objection was received from England's rivals. With such a stunning victory, there was no such problem this time. Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands." We've come together as a team over the past three months. We've come off so badly at so many world titles that to win the Olympics again was incredible. This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, having won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London. If that's a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we've got a successful five days in the velodrome ahead of us. With Kenny's form, it's entirely possible that he will repeat Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in one competition. That would be a haul for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on the same day) - of six gold medals and one silver medal. That would match Hoy's. Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will last for three days. The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this for now." The team event is always best. You can win it with your peers. It feels a little lonely to win alone. Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted." It was the only medal competition of the day but there was more good news for England. Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the fourman four kilometer race. They arrived at their destination in 3:51.942. The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659. The first and final rounds (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition, which will certainly be the focus of attention for Wiggins. He had a row with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to have his height measured. In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13.260. Team GB relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a slew of medals. After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered for Rio. Drama was playing out in the background, including technical director Shane Sutton's resignation in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirements of the likes of Hoy and Victoria Pendleton. However, watching the first night of competition at the Velodrome, it looks as if GB's now legendary reputation, which has peaked at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter in doubt due to energy contract cancellation The future of Portland's aluminum smelter in Victoria -- and hundreds of worker jobs -- is at stake as the plant operator terminates the power supply contract, thereby terminating all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said. The move follows the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the facility. A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November. Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland facility are at stake. As many as 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if it were to close. In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation. In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to the closure of Anglesea Power Station last year. Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risking closure. The move follows years of speculation about the future of the facility, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the facility. AGL, which supplies the major aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts. The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with minor stakes held by Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp. "AGL expects the Portland facility to remain operational, which means continued physical demand for power from the smelter," the company said. AGL also stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" that were scheduled to take effect from November 2016. The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017. "As such, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in FY17," the electricity supplier said. Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by forecasts of strong wholesale electricity price futures markets. AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements by $187 million in "anticipation of termination." Alcoa said the decision to close the contracts does not affect Alcoa's "ability to...operate the smelter or provide electrical power to the smelter." The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have come into effect from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it backed out of the contract. Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry's poor economic condition. Referring to analysts' statements earlier in the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually. Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]. And that would not be good for us as generators," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue September Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue. Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday. "In a room full of people I love, seeing this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. The cover reveal was followed by a bizarre (or just something like Keeping Up with the Kardashians?) scripted reality video that features the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (save for troublesome Rob and Caitlyn, plus the presence of everyone's favorite showbiz uncle and Producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) forgetting their sister's cover, which ends with a classic twist: they've all planned a surprise party. It sets up the cliched plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest delivered the line, "You thought we forgot you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit in an 8 a.m. slot), but Kris kind of had to have her other girls take part in this publicity. A new era for the Kardashians has certainly begun in anticipation of Vogue's September issue. Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her for the Vogue cover (she and husband Kanye West starred on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is in a league of its own. The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year. With a scope more akin to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of the tome's 832 pages were advertising). The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images from the magazine have leaked ahead of the official announcement. Women who have been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss. In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover. Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor. But even on the slim chance that Ms. Jenner -- described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation -- falls under the former category, she's in good company. These celebrities aren't related to famous people, or reality stars, or today's teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although all of those apply to Jenner). They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry. Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade. Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success. With her reality TV history, Jenner's place in the fashion world has always been a bit strained. In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour slammed Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment." Those feelings flared again when the news broke with Jenner appearing on the Vogue cover. But harping on the displeasure seems to miss the point. Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue. She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word. She runs for Marc Jacobs. She's promoting your Estee Lauder foundation. She and all her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps. She sells pictures she took of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine. And in her spare time she can be seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Community Justice Centers turn away 160,000 people annually More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away by community justice centers each year as the industry braces for the impact of further funding cuts on already-stretched transactions. Already in Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without funds for unjust evictions and the like - are turned away when seeking free legal advice and assistance. Municipal legal services, already overstretched, are bracing for further cuts. Beginning in June next year, these legal centers are scheduled to lose an additional 30 percent of their federal funding. Queesland Community Justice Centers director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Justice Centers found thousands of people are already being turned away each year. Farrell said that without the federal government overturning the order, the situation would only get worse. "Queensland's Community Justice Centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away from essential services that they need," he said. People walking out of abusive relationships, people in unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through breakups, workers unfairly fired - all of these people face legal problems and this survey shows they are not able to get the help they are looking for require. The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help. We are calling on Attorney General and Attorney General George Brandis, as well as Queensland Senators, to end these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need with legal problems. Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to increase legal aid funding to the national average. It is now time to look at the needs of the community justice centers and their client communities and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump Campaign Charged After Staff Member Allegedly Draws Gun New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged failure to act after being told that its campaign manager for North Carolina pointed a gun at a staff member in February while they were in a Jeep in February were on the way. The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the state's campaign. Bordini said he waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "it wasn't going to happen." The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and jammed the barrel into the back of Vincent's knee," Bordini stated in his indictment. After complaining to local and regional campaign officials, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment. "Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini stated. The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were to be elected and appoint judges . Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence. Bordini's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage. Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment. Attempts to contact Philip also failed. WCCB, a local Charlotte news station, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign staffer. Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, went unanswered. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far. The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not just to our local communities and across London, but across the country. For me, that was Heathrow's biggest draw, just as it was back in London in 2012 when we went to great lengths to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games. The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End. And we will achieve that again by creating new opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow. For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area. Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big. I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage. The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow too. There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer any question put to it. Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not individuals. Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK. We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered a £11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal for five years running, to T2 which is being built in the middle of the world's two busiest catwalks became. Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk, backed by £16 billion in private investment. The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK and I am confident the Heathrow expansion will be one too. It's time we channeled that Olympic spirit and expanded Heathrow, while safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment of which England can be proud. Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" on ad blocking For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a "cat and mouse game," according to one of the software makers. On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blocking on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to once again block ads on the social network. On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to tell which part of the page is an ad. But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes. In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and its bystanders has been going on since ad-blockers were invented," and that it's possible that Facebook is coming with a new solution soon. The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fray is a strong indication of how of concern ad blockers have become for the industry. Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year; nearly four times that of 2013. With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue. The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's social network mobile app and Instagram, a spokesman said. Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue for Facebook to consider investing in such a move worthwhile. On Tuesday, Facebook said it was updating its "Ads Preferences Tool" to give people more control over ads targeted to them. On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block non-ad content on the site. "This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesman said in an email. Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so we've instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss autobahn The victim was lying on the autobahn in the middle of the night. Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a freeway in what was believed to be her suicide early in the morning Thursday. The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight. A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said. It is evident that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself. She died on the spot. Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, police said, who are urging them and anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward. An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve. However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will appear. Was a collision avoidable? That's something for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said. Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable. In each of the two cases -- in which a person walked the highway in the dark -- It was decided that motorists should not assume that a pedestrian might be walking down the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.Last year a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she ran over and killed a man who lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014. The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court heard The court found that the policewoman -- who had answered an emergency call -- was driving in a justifiable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely extraordinary and unforeseeable situation", said the R right. Anyone with further information about Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable Venus was likely once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model. Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists. The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, might have once exhibited Earth-like conditions. Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere. But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still be spinning slowly. The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus. The planet probably had more arid regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and protected from rapid evaporation. Early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent dimmer. "In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the Sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release. This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat. The result is average temperatures several degrees cooler than Earth's today. The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously conjectured by planetary scientists. Though once thought to be habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light. Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light. As its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today. The researchers shared the results of their new Venusian climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing insufficient participation in the team's decision-making process. Colorados alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the decision, noting that the club will immediately start looking for a new manager. "For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement. I've thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team, give it more depth that it needs and take it to a higher level. To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization. He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance. These conditions are currently not met. Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team. "Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic. We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future. Roy was recognized as the Jack Adams Award winner for Best Coach in the League during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14. He led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the past two years. The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling five points behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference. As a Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike Industrial disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said. Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell. "Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," they said in a joint statement. We will be holding some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to re-engage with the issues. Unions said their latest strike, the first in over 25 years, was in protest at possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent. Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent this year due to negative market pressures. The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014. The company said additional cuts give the company the room it needs to weather the market downturn. Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to exit its oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group. Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union. Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea in a generation. The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said. "In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few," he said in a statement. In 2016 less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades star cluster The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades star cluster. The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how rotation periods are related to planet formation. "We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release. The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth. Formed about 125 million years ago, many stars in this star cluster are now reaching adulthood. They spin fastest now. At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds. As these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they have a dragging effect on the stars. As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow. Kepler measures each star's rotation rate by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable starspot -- like sunspots. The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars. Rebull likens the stars to dancers, with larger stars pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones. "In the Pleiades 'ballet' we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said. Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as spin rates. "The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said. There's still a lot ahead of us that we'd like to learn more about, how, when, and why stars slow down their spin rates and hang up their "dancing shoes," so to speak. Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation rates in three newspaper reports, forthcoming in the Astronomical Journal.
