Europe's most beautiful pools Leap into the blue By Julia Stanek Paddling pools in the shape of a UFO, magnificent pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and rest their tired legs in whirlpool baths after a city tour or a hike. A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful. When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one thing she couldn't be without in her luggage: her bathing suit. Lying on her back on the water, she gazed up at the artistically designed domes, she swam towards the marble putti waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools. If she liked a bathroom, she immediately jotted it down in her notebook - along with details worth knowing about the construction and history of the building. Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and is now presenting them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": public swimming pools in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus. Her "journey to the most extraordinary pools in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia. The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast. She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - it's just different in the water. It's just annoying that swimmers have to put up with blue tiles and the stench of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the happy chirping of birds in the park. "One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Meder, who lives in Vienna. "So I started collecting beautiful baths." Water surface doubles Architecture Splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder. And if the builders have made an effort, indoor swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, bathrooms have a water surface." "On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building." Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards. On 190 pages, the small-format photo book "Badefreuden" provides interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue. The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary. In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-rich body of water in a quaint karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and housed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszbereny). On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can see the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool of a pool in St. Anton - and: there is a window in the steam bath , from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slope. Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps. In winter, it steams from three bowls that are open at the top, while the mountains of the Ötztal tower into the sky in the background. Alhambra in the Black Forest Pool collector Meder didn't catch the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool. Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, it stinks so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath. The smell comes from the alkaline-bicarbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a special kind of wellness experience However, bathing spots are also disappointing: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech town of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off area. The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed. Peering through the weathered windows of the red, white, and yellow Art Nouveau building, Meder saw weeds growing between the tiles. On the other hand, the deterioration has been counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad. This pool has already completed three construction phases; Not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements dating back to when it was built in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Moorish hall added around 1900. Since it was carefully modernized in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she originally comes from the Black Forest. "It's quite an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder. With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation Deutsche Bank investigates commodities business By Christian Teevs Is Deutsche Bank going out of business with agricultural commodities? According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor. In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions. Hamburg - The matter is clear for German citizens: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn. Two-thirds of those surveyed are even calling for Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it aggravates the problems of the world's poorest. This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch. The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October. In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and that the banks are therefore partly to blame for the global hunger problem. The campaign by consumer advocates is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar way. Commodity bets were originally intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations. But most experts now agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest. Unlike its US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no deal was "worth jeopardizing Deutsche Bank's good reputation". According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations made in the Foodwatch report. The test should be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of directors - along with a recommendation on how to deal with them. At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to announce the consequences it is drawing. In the end there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even a complete abandonment. Ackermann tinkers with his image Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The bets on rising food prices show particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are damaging the common good today." As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann now has a special duty. "Deutsche Bank must eliminate all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said. "Regardless of whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank." Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before leaving office. On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not move to the supervisory board, contrary to what had been planned. With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image. And he hardly needs to worry about possible losses - after all, his successor would have to do with that. One in two would quit commodity investments Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high. So far, more than 30,000 internet users have taken part in the organization's campaign. Bode published the survey on Tuesday, for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on November 7th and 8th. Just eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments in which food prices are bet on. Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: according to the survey, every second customer would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation. 43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about closing their account and switching to another institute.
21er Haus in Vienna The relocated pavilion By Ingeborg Wiensowski An architectural story with ups, downs and a happy ending: the Austrian world exhibition pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and fell into disrepair. Now it will be reopened as an exhibition hall. If people are enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, about clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion designed by architect Karl Schwacher for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is a fitting and famous example . Back then, Schwacher's pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light steel and glass construction, which appears to be floating. The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture. He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world exhibition. He finally became internationally famous in 1973 with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annexe in Munich. His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's southern train station, remodeled and opened in 1962 as a 20th-century museum - it was called the "20er Haus". However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate. Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art found a new home in Vienna. The building had been empty since 2001 and was gradually falling into disrepair. The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future. Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the building belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect. Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, pushed through the new beginning. Husslein-Arco, who has a doctorate in art history and has had a remarkable career, including in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, pushed through the conversion emphatically with politicians and preservationists, she raised public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the usage. In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built. Strict supervision, small budget Krischanitz was the ideal choice for the implementation. Not only because he had sensitively remodeled and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied under Schwacher at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "incredibly important place" for him, where he " almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions. He knew the original design and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and repurposed. There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy slingshot," says Krischanitz. The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass. Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated. Two basement floors created space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides the light, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light-weight tail-pavilion. The original exterior doors remain and the house is painted in the old reddish-brown anti-rust colour. And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be. And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget. "Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and that the monument protection office also liked," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement. Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light. It was difficult with the pavilion "that came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "drop-in-the-city thing." Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real awareness". In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban development stroke of luck has occurred: around the Schweizer Garten, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" is being built, with office and residential buildings. And another stroke of luck may yet happen: The 21er Haus could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as has been heard, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package worth millions The Deutsche Bahn has devised a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in winter. The number of employees is to be doubled. That costs millions. In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report. The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal group crisis plan, that investments totaling around 300 million euros are planned by 2015. This is intended to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather. Among other things, the plan is to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people. The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice before the start of operations and 90 percent of the points required for operations within four to five hours. Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn boss Rüdiger Grube warned of train cancellations and delays again this winter. Last winter, the railways had significant problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things. Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years. There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. The railway has also been struggling for years because it has had to have the axles of ICE trains checked in the workshop much more frequently after an ICE broke an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the USA After the tumult surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new adversity comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in fines there. As if the problems at home weren't enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant's past in the USA is now catching up: the Frankfurt-based institute is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in a settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis. It's about selling mortgage securities. The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks into buying financial products with false promises; they downplayed the risks. Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down with it. "We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York. The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement. So did Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million. The NCUA chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two financial institutions. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) oversees the US credit unions and steps in when they go bankrupt to protect customer deposits. The NCUA is trying to recover the billions in damage that has been caused. The settlements that have now been concluded are the first of their kind. The regulator also took on other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer. The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities. These are based on home loans. When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it was fatal for a large number of financial firms. In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. Even if the events happened a few years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the USA. Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits seeking redress or to punish wrongdoing. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the largest wave of lawsuits. She accuses 18 major international banks of having cheated the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions with a volume of around 200 billion dollars. Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, dealing with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007. The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurt-based company be held accountable for "substantial losses", but without give an exact amount. Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to fight back.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM. He has bought more than $10 billion worth of stock since March. Up until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always stated that he would not invest in IT and computer companies because it was difficult to forecast the long-term development of the company. However, he has now read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry. He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies. An investment by Warren Buffett is considered an accolade in the financial world. As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM". Because Buffett has now revealed on the US business channel CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion since March. His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake. Buffett said that not even IBM was aware of the commitment until now. He praised the management, which had made decent profits even during the economic crisis. "They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy. IBM has relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time. The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance company computers. Buffett had previously avoided tech companies. He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands. Instead, Buffett grabbed something from a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders. In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, his holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a whole range of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re. The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with clever investments, turned it into one of the most valuable companies in the world. Still, his lifestyle is modest. He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world. His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha". After the Buffett investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent premarket. "Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth a total of more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft. Buffett said he didn't want to get involved with Microsoft. Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible After the "Zwickau cell" was uncovered, the Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany. A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving. The murders of eight small business owners of Turkish origin and one small business owner from Greece between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. This news is met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany. Because for many German-Turks, a specter that they thought was dead is returning: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has not been comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks. Nevertheless, there was never any question that there is xenophobia in Germany. However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are far from foreseeable. "Is the bloody ideology reviving?" was the title of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk". The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been an informant from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing morass. The Turkish community in Germany reacted calmly: they commemorated the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate. Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had held a ceremony to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement. The togetherness was staged in cheerful colors - as a story of success. The reporting by some Turkish media comes across as a slap in the face: "Germany's fiftieth birthday present" is the headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background to the series of murders. The German edition of "Hürriyet" also insists on making this mental connection. "It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column. He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and who made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work were murdered. The actions of the police and their subsequent success in the search are discussed extremely critically in German-Turkish Internet forums. The authors wonder why the German authorities didn't think of it much earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles. Some are ready, at least rhetorically, to take drastic measures: "If the sloppiness continues here, the migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves and take up arms." "That will probably be the best self-protection". "The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the quality of the investigation and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen". The attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear what it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger. The photo of the burnt ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory. Because no other event made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence. However, the attacks sharpened the sense of unity on the Turkish side. Don't repeat the mistakes of the past At the time, the Turkish press mainly criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but had his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel represent him at the funeral service in Cologne. In his speech at the time, Kinkel listed how many taxes the local Turks made. Just as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes. The current reporting in the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German-Turks in the local rule of law has been since then. In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and reassessment of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandalous bank from Lake Zurich The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since. Now a German should fix it. Axel Weber certainly hadn't thought of it that way. After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity, and dropping friendly remarks about future colleagues. "UBS has managed the turnaround". "I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel". But as early as September it became clear that everything would turn out very differently. A UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros. UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go. Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered ailing - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come? It has already been announced that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012. And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday. It will be tough for Axel Weber. He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed an induction period. In one fell swoop, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of "biggest scandalous bank in Europe." On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest wealth manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years. Nothing, it seems, will be spared the once proud Swiss bank. It started with the financial crisis. Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. She had combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: She also wanted to be a big hit in investment banking. In 2007, for example, UBS managed more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world, at $1.6 trillion. And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world. That made an impression. The former banker and later longtime banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "Back then, I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank." "From today's point of view one asks oneself: How could I be so wrong?" He was terribly wrong. In 2007 it became apparent for the first time that something was seriously wrong at UBS. In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly. A few months later you could guess why he had left. The bank's investment division had gambled away with subprime paper and had to write off billions. To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital increase of a whopping CHF 13 billion. She actually found investors for this, albeit ones that some would have turned up their noses at a short time ago: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive that you didn't even find out its name. But that was only the first blow. In April 2008 things got worse. The bank had to announce new losses in the billions, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who in 2006 was still the second-best paid member of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned. The catastrophe followed in October 2008: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its bad investments during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state. The National Bank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank. The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because they noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks. After all, UBS's balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic output (see chart). "We couldn't save UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger. The second catastrophe followed the first. Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have evaded taxes with the help of the bank. In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty. UBS thus admitted more or less openly that it had helped with tax evasion. At the same time, she lost something that had always been her asset in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy. After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was never the same. This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and President of the Board of Directors. And the exodus of customer funds. Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both of its central business areas: in investment banking due to the bad speculations and in asset management due to the help to tax evasion. And just when things got a little quieter again, just when you thought UBS would get it right again, this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader gambles away 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong. And it's becoming obvious that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working. "With the Adoboli case, one had to realize that risk control had changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich. The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "UBS's problem is that it doesn't have risk control under control." It was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers set out a long time ago to become the guardians of the great fortunes of the world: no great risks, but security for the money - even if the world collapsed beyond the Alpine republic . The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, just like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate. The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it's just a bit bigger. Even the location is classic. The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains. The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe. Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli. Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer. The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy revolving door. Inside, the walls are clad in marble, thick leather armchairs stand in front of them, and next to the bank logo is a large sign indicating the "safe". UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security. However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, eventually suppressed this idea of the Swiss bank - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank thinks, betrayed it. He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks. He thinks that UBS has become much too big - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread. The Swiss would no longer have a say there. "And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons." In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank. On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible. "On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash". The politicians approved up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros to save the bank from bankruptcy. How could this happen? If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS. In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge group. A bank was created that was already too big for little Switzerland when it merged - and it continued to grow. It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank. Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of cheap money with which to spin a giant wheel. Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors. "I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger. "Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut person, who worked his way up from the bank apprenticeship to the very top." But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli. And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger. "This is a tragic case." Tragic, maybe. One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall. UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: push Goldman Sachs off the throne. The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth. She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time. That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top. She had already taken a few steps. In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top. Management consultants who were commissioned, however, emphasized a weakness: In the international interest business, in banker's language "fixed income", there is a huge gap to the largest banks. UBS has gaps in American mortgage products. To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost it its existence. Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime investments. It grew into a mighty machine that packaged and passed securities on American mortgage loans—while also retaining risk itself. Even when other banks were already looking to exit. "UBS was still buying there in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames," says banking expert Geiger. As great as the euphoria, as deep as the fall. One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up proved more difficult than expected. Posts at UBS became an ejection seat and remain shaky to this day. Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job. He has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models. Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to your Swiss roots. The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet). But investment banking is set to shrink sharply, that much is already clear. Next Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world. The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel. In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he should permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday. Ermotti wants to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-1990s. He is cutting 3,500 jobs. But that won't be enough. UBS needs a vision. Who is she? How does she want to make money? These are the questions that Axel Weber is certainly already asking himself. So far he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich. Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market The looming recession in Europe discouraged US investors at the start of the week. The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact. Reduced industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud. The general relief about the change of government in Rome and Athens did not prevail. The euro fell against the dollar. In the past week, the Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott. Financial stocks in particular were on the sales slips. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones index of standard values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points. In the course of trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points. The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down 1 percent. The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and ended trading at 2,657 points. In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points. Industry in the 17 euro countries has reduced its production significantly and is preparing for the end of the upswing. In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to the statistics office Eurostat. That made US investors skeptical: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management. Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession that quickly, and there are also further signs of weakness in the banks. Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview. Therefore, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks. Instead, Buffett ditched a decades-old principle and entered the US tech industry. His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially made it almost one percent higher, bucking the trend in trading. The paper closed almost unchanged at $ 187.35. Buffett says he paid an average of $170 a share and now owns 5.5 percent. The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent. Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, significantly more than the market. The house sold almost all of the rest of its stake in China Construction Bank for $6.6 billion. Above all, the institute wants to use the net profit from the business to pad its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements. Aircraft maker Boeing rallied, limiting losses in the Dow. The share gained 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order in its history. Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and put the value of the order at $18 billion. Including options for 20 additional machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars. Around 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 719 values rose, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged. On the Nasdaq, 630 shares closed up, 1913 down and 82 flat on sales of 1.38 billion shares.
Intelligent crows are spreading in cities In many places, rooks are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, say experts. Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: Crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many communities there are increasing numbers of complaints from residents about the animals' dirt and noise. A remedy for the "problem birds" is not yet in sight. Experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer that rooks can no longer be gotten out of the cities. There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out. They are looking for alternatives in the cities Nature conservationists also attribute the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the specially protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats. Hunting, increasing building and the felling of typical nesting trees made life difficult for the birds. Crows are protected. There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest in Westphalia, in the north-west in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer. There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district made negative headlines. Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and beating them with clubs as particularly brutal. "The normal expulsion, the scaring away, brings nothing," said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer. Splashing away nests with water or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. "The animals evade, large colonies split up and spread to other places." Deterrence is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools. "We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them." The problem in the cities cannot be solved without the surrounding area, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer. A combination of deterring the animals from sensitive living areas and offering lures to resettle them in other places is conceivable. "Information boards instead of chainsaws," the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated a completely different approach to animals: "After all, we can best endure a pimple on our face with self-confidence." In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg crows educational trail, where signs provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rooks. The project is already being accepted by tourists. Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other." The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use tools to get a treat, they even use tools to make their own tools. Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four rooks to see how far the birds' intelligence reaches. In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to break down scaffolding in order to get at a moth larva. Without much training, they single-mindedly recognized what size and shape a stone needs to be in order to collapse the platform. In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a trickier problem. The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder. The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks. However, the researchers had put pieces of wire down for them. All four animals used this to form a hook, which they then used to fish the bucket out of the tube by the handle. Three of the four rooks even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EURO 2012 The Bosnians and the Turks had no hopes of a coup. The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at the EM 2012. Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs. Led by the doubly successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and after the 0-0 in the first leg made the fifth European Championship participation perfect. In the second leg of the play-off, the Czechs drew 1-0 (0-0) against outsiders Montenegro, after the first leg (2-0) had already been a clear thing. Croatia also didn't miss a beat in the 0-0 draw against Turkey, while Ireland won an easy 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia. Nani (24'), Helder Postiga (72', 82') and Miguel Veloso (80') scored the other goals for Portugal. Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted hand penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had reduced twice for Bosnia. Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th). Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a great start. Ronaldo fired in a free-kick from around 30 yards out for an early lead. A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shooting qualities and scored from 25 meters to make it 2-0. Missing for the first half hour, the Bosnians had their first clear chance through goalscorer Edin Dzeko. The ex-Wolfsburg player from English leaders Manchester City headed the underside of the bar, but the ball did not go over the goal line (33'). Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic The focus was then on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding. After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese a yellow card (36'). On the other side, Stark gave a controversial hand penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely converted. But after the break, the 2004 European Vice Champion made everything clear with four goals. Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute. This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European champion is going to the European Championships. The team coached by Michal Bilek, with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg), was lucky and had to endure a moment of shock in the early stages. Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment. Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was in action. In the 40th minute, Damjanovic fired just wide of Cech's goal from a turn from the edge of the penalty area. After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, the FC Seoul striker had shot again (50th). The goal just before the end finally made everything clear. Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb. Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not get more than 0:0 in Zagreb. While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly have to vacate his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup bronze medalist, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship finals. The Turks almost got off to a dream start in front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium. Selcuk Inan hit the post with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to put the rebound into the goal. After the moment of shock, however, Croatia took more and more control. Even after the break, the Croatians didn't miss a beat. In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action. Trapattoni goes to the European Championships In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany. Stephen Ward put coach Giovanni Trapattoni's side, who had secured a 4-0 win in the first leg, ahead in the 32nd minute. Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the guests. Ireland pushed the pace from the start but had to wait until 23 minutes before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane had the first good chance. Only at the last moment did the Estonian back line prevent a possible opening goal. In the 32nd minute it was time. After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was there and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.
