400 jobs will be relocated The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt. In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park. The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt. As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Strasse in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt. A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs for the group, which were previously distributed across the region, should be accommodated there. The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park were better suited to the way the employees worked. In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant. The managing director responsible, Bernd Wagner, said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure". The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu. The recent relocation of a key company within the region yesterday caused joy among winners and disappointment among losers. Frankfurt's head of economic affairs, Markus Frank (CDU), said that a "global player" had once again been won. This is a "great commitment to the location". Fujitsu suits the city, the settlement is an important stimulus for Niederrad. Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision. The city was informed early on by the management about the intention. "Of course we offered the company our help," said Korwisi. However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties the computer manufacturer had with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz. Ultimately, economic reasons would have tipped the scales. The task now is to prevent a long vacancy in such a prominent location. "I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative." Ten years ago, the house on Rathausplatz previously used by Fujitsu and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz. As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the train station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings. In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses. The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid. The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world. It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service. The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich. The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS. For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building. The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - is home to the Central Association of the Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry, among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange Wikileaks is increasingly under pressure. The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the unveiling platform from its servers. Political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables may be behind this. Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England. The Wikileaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States. The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe. Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks. And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is said to be in Great Britain, according to a newspaper report. "Wikileaks ousted from Amazon server." "Free speech in the land of the free," said the disclosure activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time). Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers. The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents. Wikileaks tweeted: "Great - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe." If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books." Amazon stopped WikiLeaks' use of its servers after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office. The head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported. "I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given WikiLeaks' previous releases of classified information," the senator said. Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from being used for servers in other countries. "Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless actions are jeopardizing our national security and endangering lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement. "No responsible company - American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material." Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list. According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in Great Britain and the exact location is known to Scotland Yard. The internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue by his opponents. Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats. "There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange." That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said. The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide. Hrafnsson was apparently responding to statements from North America. In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has called for those responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be charged with treason and executed. In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - apparently ironically - on television that Assange should "be killed" and that Obama could "use a drone". Meanwhile, an exchange of blows broke out between the White House and Assange. US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently revealed calls for spying on diplomats. "I'm not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said. "Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website." The American government is now comprehensively examining the protection of its databases. The White House announced that Vice Director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures Russell Travers had been appointed as the special representative. Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that became necessary after WikiLeaks disclosed the embassy reports. The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government shares and protects information. The American government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the Wikileaks publication. "We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley. "We stand ready to protect them should the need arise."
The Ice Cream University At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons. The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of participants and visitors from all over the world. Where does all the ice actually come from? From Gelatiere and Gelataio. The gelatiere, in German somewhat archaic the ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making. The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, spreads it into the cone and then sells it. You don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia, in the province of Bologna, to know this. But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't avoid the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani. The Ice Cream University was set up by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines would live up to the high Italian ideals everywhere. The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of visitors and visitors from all over the world. But there are also multi-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor. Some people dream of a new career during their mid-life crisis, while others simply venture onto the slippery slope of their vague desires. This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia. Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the future in the land of industrial ice cream. Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and, after years in a nerve-wracking job, wants to bag something of her own. Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo. A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream. Maestro gelato Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream. Not only good taste is decisive, but also silky suppleness and good consistency. During his training, Luciano doesn't forget the icing on the cake of the national and Mediterranean superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there's a lot of romance involved." The first step in making it seems quite simple. Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool it down to four degrees. Then he turns on a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream. The lecturer was immediately besieged with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer? How can you let your own desire to experiment run free? Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist. Anyone who talks about ice cream "made only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean. Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will bite on nothing but grains of ice cream. Certain variations on the base are permitted. It gets more exciting with the aromas. For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets section of the supermarket. There are also powders and pastes. "The suppliers will all try to sell you dozens of flavored supplements." "But you should just experiment." Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. Or with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations. Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines. Luciano has them make four different types of ice cream each: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural additives. The fruit ice cream varieties are also subjected to the same experiment. More flavorings, more fruit puree - it's not necessarily better in terms of taste. Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts. The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabilizer. Only a balanced mix really brings out the flavor of a gelato, says Luciano. Ice cream making is a math problem: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced. Lemon ice cream needs an extra portion of sugar. Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit (winegrowers use it to measure the Oechsle in the grape must). Luckily, spreadsheets make the math easier. Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to. Not only the device for the automatic production of the base helps. There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures at the same time. Despite all the automation, small glitches are inevitable. Brazilian Gustavo is covering himself and his classmates in fruit puree when his oversized hand blender goes out of control. "In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight The European food authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants. The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now formulating this accusation. "It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich. The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years. It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer. Kuiper has played a key role in the Efsa test regulations for genetically modified plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then. The Efsa regulations are paragraphs identical to Ilsi position papers and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is actually supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy. It is the second time that Testbiotech has complained about a conflict of interest. For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or a transitional period - and thus switched sides. The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industry lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians prick up their ears. However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest. According to a statement, all reputable data are used, including those from the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality. The experts who work for Efsa are not expected to have no contacts with the industry. But you would have to disclose them. Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US. This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate. In this regard, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently being approved without any animal feeding trials and that the reaction of genetically engineered plants to environmental influences is not being tested. "We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field," says Then. The current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results. "If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" Then asks accusingly. Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way too. The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich. In this field, as in the USA, the industry is now also trying more and more in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists. There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not linked to corporations. Studies that are critical for companies are usually not published. "Industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos. On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back. It was demo. It snowed. The story is well known: in September, the excavators arrived and began demolishing a large section of the north wing. The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-euro lowering of the station. When construction came to a halt, much of the wing lay in ruins. Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces. Crailsheimer shell limestone, a soft, coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920. Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old. He's secured a few of the chunks. "These stones are relics." "You mustn't go away." He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy." When he sawed one open, it smelled of cigarette smoke. He doesn't yet know what he'll do with the chunks. Stones have time. Uli Gsell too. The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom. The 44-year-old trades in old stones. He bought everything that came up during the demolition in Stuttgart. "It would be a shame if they were ground up into gravel or ended up in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was once a sentry box. He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought what was left of the north wing from the demolition contractor. But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days. And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition. And if it does happen, then it would be the most sensible thing for the stones to be reused. Around 200 opponents of the S-21 then took one of the cuboids, which weighed an average of 80 kilos and cost 6.50 to 14 euros each. As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it when it is rebuilt. Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads. About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold. Garden owners, landscape gardeners, home builders. They came from everywhere and hauled away whatever trunk and trailer could carry. The stumbling blocks in Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or into the borders of herb beds. "Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen. "Wouldn't be the political component." He climbs into his SUV and takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire. He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer. And stone lovers. He stores 40,000 tons of stones. He carts his treasures together from all over Germany. He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the republic. He brakes. Artfully carved sandstones lie in the snow. "They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden," he says. Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves. "My favorite stone." It goes up the path through the forest. He points to a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station. And further. "Nice travertine." The cuboids once belonged to the stands of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium. Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Sankt Blasien cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital. What work, what toil, what sweat. When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hand-hewn and moved with simple pulleys and ox-carts, he becomes quite awestruck. "It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that." He didn't get rich, certainly not filthy rich. But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have also settled up in the forest. "We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the recycler. He has to go to Cologne soon. There are stones to be saved there too.
Talent battle for high potentials There is a lively rush at the buffet. 16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets. The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop. In a kind of ideas competition, they are supposed to talk shop with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time. In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities. Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls, before they enter the job market and are courted by others. And because the universities do not publish any lists of their students' achievements, they try to spot and retain exceptional talent in practical projects. On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is courting the talents. A young lady from the human resources department hands out pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo. She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group. Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW. He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students make contact with industry and gain experience." "VW can simultaneously get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who might be suitable employees." According to Selle, such cooperations are not unusual. What is new is that the students are courted so aggressively. "Otherwise the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle. The fight for the freshly graduated will probably become even harder. In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants. Instead, they have to advertise themselves and court courtship, especially for highly qualified workers. Engineering graduates in particular are in an excellent negotiating position. According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October. And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineer gap will become even larger. Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG. He organizes complex recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates. The company intends to send eight promising students across the United States over the next year. At the same time, participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company. Who is allowed to participate is decided in two selection rounds in advance. Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants fly to the USA. According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when it comes to fighting for high potentials at universities. "We want to stand out from the crowd with the race." "Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us." For talent hunter Dykta, the calculation seems to be working out. "We are still in contact with everyone who took part in a similar campaign last year." "Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says. In addition to courting directly on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular go on the prowl at careers fairs in the classic way. "We try to reach graduates at trade fairs." "For example at the Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Human Resources at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld. The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany. Stübe knows about the problem of young people. There are currently 35 positions advertised on the company website. "It's very difficult to fill vacancies right now." "It takes a lot of time and money," she says. Another way is to contact the university professors. Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg. "The professors give advice that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis." Expensive advertising campaigns are not popular with solar specialists. The company tries to advertise itself with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication. "A large corporation often can't offer that," says Head of Human Resources Stübe. Money is no longer the main factor when looking for a job. Flexible working hours, childcare and good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors. In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany. The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers. To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees. Head of Human Resources Stübe hopes that the placement will also give the job seekers a plus point. "I think applicants look particularly for external reviews about a potential employer," she says. Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy. He advises his customers to be more authentic. And that means, according to Kriegler, primarily internal measures. "The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says. In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within your own workforce. "Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors." If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would all of their own accord advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances. "It's like playing with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years. The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus finally revoked its earlier plans. New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being. This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday. The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform in April. Before the accident, which claimed the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. The proponents want to reduce the United States' dependency on oil supplies from abroad. It has not yet been conclusively clarified who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf. At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is being confronted with demands in the billions. A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is to present its results in the course of December. In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the blast. Various oil companies then immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects. Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe with stricter controls and stricter security regulations. The responsible control authority, which fell into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being fundamentally reformed. At the same time, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies. The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation. "The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday. The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation." Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland has burned down The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland. People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking. Celestine Akpobari means well. "Don't toil," the eco-activist reassured the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today." The 37-year-old Nigerian followed an attempt to photograph a boy wading chest-deep in water with the streaks surrounding him: the scene looks almost pretty in the rainbow-colored water sheen. There is no sign of brown plumes of crude oil floating beneath the surface. She used to collect buckets of shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River. In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing waters are completely dead. Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil spilled out of a burst pipeline into the huge wetland. Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach waters that contain fish: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world. Driving through the mangrove swamps, which are criss-crossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent. Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, and anyone who dips their hand in the water pulls out oily fingers. The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black liquorice sticks, and the occasional palm tree sadly hangs its fronds. One looks in vain for flocks of birds, which are otherwise common in wetlands: as soon as the outboard engine is silent, an eerie calm spreads in the former paradise that smells like a gas station. "What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly. "We live in constant danger to our health." The war comparison is appropriate. The settlement area of the Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been fought over for decades: This is where the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, this is where the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, this is where the Shell -Group ceased production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers. The company is still prevented from returning to Ogoniland today: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped out of the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland lie idle The company's situation is unstable. Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude out of the water like bizarre sculptures: the heads of the boreholes are far too affectionately called "Christmas trees". They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the core. Such a drill head keeps breaking apart, says Akpobari, and a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water. According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the ecosystem of the delta in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that penetrated into the sea off Alaska when the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" crashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the world Human history. There is a dispute about who is responsible for the ongoing ecological meltdown. While the Shell company blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits. In 2008, US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of having much lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual elsewhere in the world. In what looks from afar like an abandoned, oil-smeared open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: stark naked and covered in oil up to their necks. A fire flickers under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to pipes, some of which are scattered randomly around the site: an illegal small-scale refinery. In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group. First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the catch pot, later kerosene and finally diesel trickle out at the end of the pipe. In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 liter barrels of diesel every day: "That earns us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars. The delta dwellers take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria has only one refinery. The illegal stoves can even undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 euro cents per liter: Because they get their raw material for free. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil every day in this way throughout the Niger Delta. However, only a tiny fraction of the temporarily stored raw material is processed illegally: organized criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion's share in tankers and sell it on the world market. The activist Akpobari considers the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the activities of the population or the lax production methods to be purely academic. "If the oil companies weren't perceived as invaders and if they hadn't so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries." In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell in particular has been so badly damaged that the only option is for the group to withdraw: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better." That's when Michael gets nervous. "It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular oilman. "The soldiers can come any minute." If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not face arrest, but they do face a painful bribe. Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who primarily come from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material. "This damn stuff has turned our country upside down in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines The A380 apparently has a major safety problem. While examining an emergency-landed machine, investigators have discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure". The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer. The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently much luckier than previously known: the Australian aviation security authority found a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error. The potential defect would have serious consequences: it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection, according to a statement by the ATSB authority published on Thursday. This could have resulted in "a catastrophic engine failure". Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series are affected. Among them is the Qantas Airbus that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th. The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer. She filed a statement of claim in an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him further legal action against the company. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November. When the engine caught fire, parts had come loose and damaged the wings. Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage. After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide now have to be replaced. The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines. The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan. The security issue had been deemed important enough to inform all concerned. The airline grounded its A380 fleet for weeks after the Qantas plane made an emergency landing. Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s. Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure. The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos from Germany all in white: snow fell almost all over the country overnight. Chaos reigns on many streets, trains and flights are cancelled. At least three people died in car accidents. Winter freezes Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places. In the north and east there is sometimes 15 centimeters thick snow cover. Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads. Winter service was in constant use on the A7 near Flensburg, but could not cope with the constantly new snow blowing up. In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast. The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning. In Saxony, the snowdrifts on the autobahns and federal roads led to significant problems. According to the storm center Meteomedia, the alarm level purple was announced in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever. In some cases, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts. Several trucks and cars got stuck there during the night. In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets. On the A2, snow and wind led to slow traffic and traffic jams. In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall. According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria. The main problems are snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and points. In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued. An ICE to Munich had to stop in Saalfeld, Thuringia. The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers. Snow winds swept across the streets. At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations. According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich. According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been canceled in Frankfurt am Main. The winter service is in continuous use. Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 camp beds ready for them. There were already accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening. In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein. The train driver was slightly injured. A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was hit on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck. The driver died. Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours. In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg. However, the meteorologists have good news: The snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore whirl up even with light gusts. But the wind will weaken. Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds. However, it remains very cold - in places down to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers Deutsche Bank wants to part with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters. The property could bring in up to 500 million euros. Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters look pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to go back to their old jobs. But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman. The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale. "We always check whether it makes more sense to own real estate or to sell it and then rent it back," he said. This means that Germany's largest bank is giving up its company headquarters after a short time. The bank took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors in an in-house fund and then extensively renovated them. According to the information, the energetic conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros. A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money. According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Greentowers", at around 500 million euros. Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead miners More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have commemorated the trapped miners who were pronounced dead after multiple explosions at a mine. The bodies have still not been recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft remains precarious. Almost two weeks ago there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth. 29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground. A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but found no sign of survivors. Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue workers could descend for safety reasons. After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the miners. The bodies have not yet been recovered. Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service. Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island in bright sunshine. They were silent for two minutes. Twenty-nine tables were set up in honor of the buried miners, with helmets, lamps and the names of miners on them. Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here. Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told those attending the commemoration that New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth". "But they never came home." Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit, said he couldn't wrap up his son's death until he saw his body. In addition to the prime minister and the victims' relatives, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration ceremony. Miners of British and South African descent were also buried in the first explosion on November 19. Rescue workers began putting out a fire inside a coal mine in New Zealand's South Island. Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that once the explosive gases were displaced, work would begin to cool down the blistering temperatures inside the mine.
Hell warrior! Does splatter go with art cinema? Director Nicolas Winding Refn rediscovers old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising". What kind of audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when filming "Walhalla Rising"? A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his enemies in droves with almost superhuman strength - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use ruthless methods of killing served and sometimes ripped the intestines out of his enemies when he was in a bad mood. On the other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word for the whole movie, and the other characters only let themselves be carried away by a sentence or two or a few agonized death screams at most. Otherwise there is silence and revel in the creepily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago. Ideal rather for adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and very calm tracking shots. It's nice when a film has several target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other. Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or to the art house with a little less brutality. Most art cinema fans should be put off by the splashing brain matter and intestines. The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, One-Eye sets off with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in the doldrums and fog for an eternity before the team apparently arrives in America and remains silent there. So it's no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" didn't find a cinema distributor in Germany and has now only been released on DVD. That's a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-soaked facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention. This film isn't about dialogue or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a fever dream made into a film. And from that there is no escape for the viewer. Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly constricts his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that beats at him from the hearts of the characters. Only a little blond boy, loyal to One-Eye, retains anything resembling innocence, all others are driven by anger. Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself. He spells doom, but perhaps only for the already corrupted. "Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film to hate and admire, to vex, excite and marvel at. An experience.
Mysterious earthworks The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria. However, the country refuses to comment on this - it still allows controls. Around midnight September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria. It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur. Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria is said to have built with help from North Korea in the ashlar, hidden in a valley branching off the river. According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built. For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable. The CIA ran a video presentation with blurred satellite imagery. Using computer animation, she showed where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center. She also submitted photos showing the building up close or even the interior. The reactor was about to be commissioned, it said, but had not yet been fitted with fuel rods. Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, and the mysteries have only gotten bigger over time. Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, prior to the attack, the CIA was fairly certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that the country was " an active nuclear weapons program". Some secret service agents in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible". They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA. When asked how sure he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a high-ranking UN diplomat answered succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions." The Syrians hurriedly cleared away the rubble from the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly leveled the site. However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar. In addition, the IAEA received satellite imagery from commercial providers in the immediate aftermath of the attack through one member state, which may be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA. However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively. Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity. Syria has always maintained that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor. The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said. But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles. Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like it did about the satellite images. It also denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building. But Israel is also staunchly silent. "We will never comment on that," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position. The investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008 without any results and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna concedes - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA watches over. The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are said to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike this, still exist, as the key to progress in the investigation. So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which systems are involved, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious. According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities. The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects. It may be located in or adjacent to a military base -- and that's exactly why Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites. In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the USA to spy on military installations. Because the nuclear detectives became aware of the facilities through a tip from the US secret services. The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates cuboid. A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production". But there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes necessary to build nuclear weapons. The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched. But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was later to be separated from it, there are at best plausible assumptions on these central questions. It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable evidence was stored at the three locations. As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants to know where the rubble went. The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 to be suitable as a repository for radioactive waste, to be unlikely. Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review. But footage from orbit shows Syria carrying out earthworks and removing large containers at the three suspect locations after the IAEA requested access. That may be coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion. In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to protect any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors is. However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal. A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter was not of great urgency Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls. IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future," but he still hesitates. There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation. Second, as one diplomat points out, "What if they end up not finding anything?"
Love in times of war There has been trouble since Angelina Jolie began work on her as yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer. She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man. Not much more is known about it - but that alone is enough to cause unrest. The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war. Bosnian women's organizations protested immediately, which prompted some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to be moved to Hungary at short notice. The film has now been shot and is in post-production in Hungary, but there are still protests in Bosnia. Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador for the UN refugee agency. She's not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they turned it down. According to Hasecic, the meeting must take place in Bosnia. There weren't any love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script. According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as ambassador, the Guardian reports. But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes? After some back and forth, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her screenplay to read, gave permission to film in Sarajevo - it's not entirely clear why Jolie still didn't come. The young author herself affirms that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to familiarize herself with the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all parties involved a voice. However, she remains vague about the content. A second synopsis of the film is circulating online, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war broke out and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is kidnapped in a Serbian camp where he is a guard is working. Which sounds a lot different than the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer". That Jolie's film actually begins before the war - that much is certain. The pressure on her, according to Jolie, was "unfair and based on misinformation". Now only Hollywood hackers can bring her peace: by illegally posting the script, like so many before, on the Internet.
Let's get out of here On this evening things are finally going really well for the Irish again. Not a trace of sadness. The home team dominates their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for that. The fans hoot with joy to the loud music, they stamp their feet. The Bailey Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, trembles because the players throw table tennis balls three meters into beer mugs - and hit them. The bizarre spectacle is called "beer pong" and there is a prize of 500 euros plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January. Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist don't really go together. And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, to distract himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring. His plan isn't to have fun in Las Vegas, he'll be interviewing in New Zealand in January. "I have a queasy feeling about it," he says. "It's so far from home and I don't have a job there yet." After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had the job of her dreams as an event manager in no time, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles. Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already tried their luck abroad. His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London. The boys leave: It's like the Tanners in many families on the island. Experts at the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict that 100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future. They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015. A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants. If the forecasts come true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s. After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is once again spreading. The economic crisis unsettles the young, well-educated Irish people in particular, for whom things have only been going uphill so far. Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years. Everyone was needed, money was in abundance. In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are unemployed. The Irish Times abounds with letters to the editor from young expats complaining: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland." "There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but those who can leave and our country loses a whole generation." "The last one please turn off the light." Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future ahead because the government is just window dressing and offering young people no future prospects. "They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old. She watches her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next. Her biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years. "That thought is sad and depressing." Men like Stephen McLarnon try to cast a positive light on the topic. McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a full service on the subject of working abroad. "For job starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps up the career ladder," says the manager. Photos on his website show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada. The message is clear: working abroad is not galley service, it also brings freedom and fun. For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known how it feels to build something up somewhere else. Because there was nothing more for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany. In Gelsenkirchen they are currently building a fashion house. In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project. O'Donovan rarely sees his home country these days, working extra shifts to pay off the loan on his house back home. "The situation is a bit crazy," he says, stepping over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time. "I'm earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I hardly ever stay in anymore." He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cold rooms. The small house is in a fine residential area with well-tended front gardens, and large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways. Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent debt-financed. "They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says. Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong? O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea and says, "I don't have any kids to feed and I'm young; even if things go wrong, I can start over." The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing he hears a lot these days. "Nobody has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it used to be here on the island," he says. "Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe that's what makes us feel Irish." He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis. "After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, simple as that." Cian Tanner likes this idea. Leave the future open and just see how things are going with life somewhere else. He already has a few years of work in London behind him and why shouldn't things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand? But there is still one thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin. He fears it could turn into a farewell party. "Just don't get too emotional," he says, taking a long gulp of his beer. "Goodbye, that sounds scary." "Let's call it a walk away party, easygoing, with some friends, some drinks, some games."
