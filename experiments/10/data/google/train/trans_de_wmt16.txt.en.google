In an 911 call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend In a 911 call, Professor Shannon Lamb, in a slightly shaky voice, told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers had to come to his house. It was important for Lamb to stress that his "cute dog" was still alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her cellphone. Inside the home, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scrawled on a white pad: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me". According to the authorities, this was what the letter said and it was signed by Lamb. There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where police say he met a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt shot and killed the door to his office. Delta State University Police Commissioner Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 am. He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that. By the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took his own life as police surrounded him. A day after the campus shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb. The details released by investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher. Students said they looked forward to his classes. Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history. Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, mentioning the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life. Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a 17-strong faculty, and many students took courses from both. At the same time, there were some propensities for problematic behaviors. One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him." Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year. Lamb previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had some medical condition. This year he only taught two online courses. Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic route to an assistant professorship. University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination." These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer. After escaping campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas. Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber handgun in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said. His car was still in the driveway. It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there. Lamb grew up in the area. Lamb began work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and pedagogy. He received his doctorate in education in the spring. One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny. Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends. She and her friends were in high school and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her to play the guitar for a few years. He was a heartthrob back then. All the girls melted when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and a resident of the Jackson suburb of Brandon. Lamb and Prentiss apparently dated for some time. In the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage. They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick home that borders a bayou in Gautier. Police said the dog was fine. Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who is now 19. "She was absolutely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter, her and hers Mother were absolute best friends. O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues. Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at one three years ago Summer fair occurred They played one or the other gig together. O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music. Prentiss was a nurse working for various companies online. Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said the night of September 5 was the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience. There were no signs that anything was wrong. "Just a happy couple," he said. We were cleaning up and joking with each other. I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes. Schmidt, the dead professor, ran the freshman seminar program, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school. He was married and had three small children. He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and served as president of his fraternity and student council. About 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland. Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil while the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace." Classes will resume on Wednesday. "We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said. The crisis is over. This is a day of healing. Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi. Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb called 911 after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamm referred to Prentiss as his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication the two ever met have married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season Toys R Us says it won't be hiring as many holiday-season workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it is currently at will give its employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours. The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. At Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were hired. Most jobs will be part-time jobs. The company said it will start job interviews this month and the headcount will increase from October to December. With the holidays themselves months away, the holiday shopping season is fast approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to staff stores with staff to sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His "Date" With Princess Diana The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox professionally. She was also notable for personal reasons. "We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and I'm starting to realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary Back In times". As the film begins, it occurs to me that I'm a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales. Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg. "Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago. "It really is for me," said Spielberg, "arguably the greatest time travel movie ever made." "Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support to Syria is "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons are being used and violence only aggravate misery for millions of people. The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution. Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent member nations - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria to discuss. He regretted that divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable." Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Polls That Show Donald Trump Should Be Taken Seriously Some have tried to brand it a flop. Others dismissed it as a joke. And some are waiting for a breakdown. But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't worked (yet). Ten of the last eleven national polls have put Donald Trump in the double-digits lead, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of being nominated. Of course it is still too early in the election period. No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination. Experts point out that by this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership had been ceded to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process. And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election. But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's staying power and are beginning to pour their dollars in to topple him. Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase: Trump's popularity ratings have flipped 180 degrees. Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively. By mid-July it was 40 percent. At the beginning of August it was 52 percent. Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump. About three in ten say they have a negative opinion. And those numbers hold up in early states. A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found 60 percent of Republicans favor Trump. Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as their nominee. In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "thrilled" or "happy" if Trump was nominated. Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate. Only Ben Carson creates about the same excitement as Trump (43 percent say they're "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump). Next in excitement? Marco Rubio with only 21 percent. On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became the nominee. A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem. While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the property mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday. The same number applies in the nation's first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week. Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temper doesn't suit the White House, according to ABC/Post. Republican voters are getting used to the idea. Putting on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real. When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week. That's a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush in late July. Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past. At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for final nominee Mitt Romney. Still, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible. Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone. Some pundits point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates. But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump wins majority support. He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points. It's neck and neck with Ted Cruz. The only candidate to beat him? Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race. A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they've made up their minds. A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows just over half of voters who support Trump say they firmly cast their votes. Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind. 46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates. Still, Trump's closest rival right now is the other underdog, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made up their minds are twice as likely to support Trump. Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration. Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of public discourse about 2016. Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep key Hispanics out of the Republican Party and will damage reorientation efforts. But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues. So as long as immigration stays in the spotlight, apparently Donald Trump will too. Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs. Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have around half the support of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status. Six in 10 Republicans say they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience in Monday's new ABC/Post poll. And they're angry with Washington, too. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time Eagerly awaited since his election Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his Prime Minister's Question Time debut and take on David Cameron for the first time. Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-determined questions just after midday, with his performance likely to be scrutinized by the media and Labor MPs at close range. He called for "less drama and more facts" at this weekly event. He has also said he can skip some sessions to let colleagues do them. The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech at Tuesday's TUC annual meeting. Meanwhile, the Labor leader's decision to remain silent while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and has been the focus of several front-page Stories in the newspapers. Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respected silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain". But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he had advised the Labor leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished. Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences on the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader. BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piling up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the European Union's position on capping profits. Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labor is tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether. Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Works and Pensions Minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposed to Government plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000. Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader to face David Cameron across the dispatch box in Parliament since he became Tory leader in the last decade. The Labor leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions. The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "quick wit" and barbed arguing, opting instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people to concentrate. Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, will represent him when he is not attending - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad. He has also floated the idea of other colleagues speaking occasionally and that he has approached Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue. When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed at it. Since it was first televised in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been seen as the prime barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his peers in Parliament, although critics have argued that it has become caricature and needs it far-reaching reforms.

Pound Rises on Accelerating UK Wage Growth The pound jumped on data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target. Between May and July, UK non-bonus earnings grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year. This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of when interest rates would rise. The pound was up more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730. The FTSE 100 Index ended up 1.49% at 6,229.21. SABMiller was the standout stock on the market, jumping 20% after receiving a takeover bid from rival AB InBev. A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch. Burberry shares were up 0.9% on encouraging news from luxury goods rival Richemont. Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again reporting growth. Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion from a share sale as part of its debt-reduction strategy. Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company to "sell". JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported pre-tax profit of $46.6 million for the half-year.
JD Sports chief says higher wages threaten expansion JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more buying power in the pockets of potential customers". But that purchasing power is unlikely to offset higher labor costs at his company, he says. The expense could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches down-to-earth campaign to combat Aldi incursion Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia. Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA retailers' market share in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700m Aldi invasion. As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local grocery suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social marketing Media, as well as events such as the Adelaide Show. IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands including Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo handing out samples at IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers. Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on Sept. 29 when the grocery, alcohol and appliances wholesaler conducts its annual Investor Strategy Day. The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's Eastern States IGA network. Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers command a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in Australia the eastern states. However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after its first stores open, Aldi will snap up about 5 percent of the grocery market in those two states, stealing sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers. According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016. This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA over the next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market. The loss in the food and grocery business and volumes on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said. At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal. Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and grocery sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its 14 percent market share in 2015 10.3 percent by 2020. Last week, at a business lunch in Melbourne, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told Metcash that Metcash will probably be out of business within a decade. Metcash will disappear. Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr Douglass' comments. But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week. IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which serves about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while squeezing sales and margins . However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to align retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to help IGA retailers improve their stores with faster-growing fresh produce and better private-label selection - to deliver groceries. Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says pricing adjustments and store refurbishment programs will add momentum and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis endorsed by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour. Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm involving his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own conduct, according to Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy. Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo consistently dubbed the 'Special Ks', came under the spotlight after Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters. In a fiery Cincinnati qualifier soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were twice separated by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should've punched the kid." While he was last seen smashing a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy. The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain. "One thing I'm quite upset about is the fact that I think Thanasi got a little involved in the argument," Healy said. He broke a racquet when he lost the US Open to a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he did is not proud of it. But, really, he's done extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and such, and I think he deserves a lot of credit. He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too harshly. He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in Form, he is a very stable and mature young chap and I believe he deserves to be judged on his own merits. Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the all-important prelim that starts on Friday and he describes the "joint decision" as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man as a long-term fixture in the team "First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios]," said Healy. And I think Nick's rise very quickly has been followed by the likes of Federer and Murray pointed out, he's rising in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, some Time out of the spotlight where he can just think about it I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's the B este for him.
Europe's migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, holds migrants back Hungary declares a state of emergency and sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone attempting to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants. Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants massed in a no man's land and Serb officials reacted with outrage. The people fleeing violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two countries' checkpoints for an unknown amount of time, pitching tents and settling there. But frustrations mounted. As a police helicopter hovered overhead, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police. Some refused food and water in protest. Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece. (Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage. Talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague. The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in by surprise Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU countries would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary. Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an emergency European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis, but Hungary has not pinned its hopes on any immediate action from Brussels or its own Neighbors The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two sü Urban regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum procedures. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border. CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia. In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view at odds with other EU states, including Germany , stands. The new laws, which came into effect at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also set higher prison terms for convicted traffickers. "Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged. We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime. Parliament has yet to procedurally approve the military's deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days. Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country. They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and charged with committing crimes under the new laws. Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence. Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car carrying barbed wire to close the borders arrived. Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and a crowd squeezed to squeeze in. About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside. Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary and said they would be denied food and water until allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut in half in national poll Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground on her. Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (up from 58 percent), while Sanders is second at 27 percent (up 17 percent). Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, has support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primary. With more than five months to go before the primary begins, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say their minds are set on which candidate they will support. But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates. Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost across a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains. Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed. Their men's support has dropped significantly, and Sanders is just 5 points behind here. Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now level. However, Clinton still has a large lead among older voters. Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group. About half of the Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if the party nominated her. A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate. Six percent would not support them. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly smitten with her. Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically. While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their lead candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent). When Clinton's supporters are asked an open-ended question about why they want her to be the nominee, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent). Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent). Agreement to deal with the issues and eligibility are also cited. Because the vice president holds potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want him in the running -- although a third believe he shouldn't. When Democratic primary voters are asked who their second pick for the party would be, Biden comes out on top. Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, well ahead of Sanders. If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race. Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent in the last month. Biden is a distant second on that measurement, but the percentage who see him as the "most eligible" is up. Still, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility. Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters. The Democratic candidate or potential candidate performs well on some key characteristics among voters in their party's primary. Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership qualities. Out of the three candidates, Biden scores best on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership. Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him. Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views. By all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders. As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't affected their opinions overall. But it's a different story with the American public altogether. Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied. Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light. Most Americans said the email controversy hadn't affected their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened. It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have deteriorated. Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by voters in her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down 8 percent from last month and down 15 points since May. 62 percent of eligible voters do not consider her to be an honest and trustworthy person. At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy. However, Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership. Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush score best on honesty. A majority sees Sanders as more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him. The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll The two candidates now have half of voter support in the new poll, with others losing Dramatically On Hold Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support grows from 23% in the latest CBS poll, conducted ahead of Fox News' debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday's poll. But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period. The poll also found that Carson resonates well with demographic groups and outperforms Trump among college-educated Republican voters. The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is trailing with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%. The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September. The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson rising in the polls - landing at 19% Republican support, behind Trump at 32% support. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also put Trump well ahead of Carson. Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some digs at the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's beliefs. "We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with death of Baruch College freshman Nearly two years after a student died during a victimizing sorority ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are being filed against five people. Members of New York's Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said. Officials said he was blindfolded, loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while attempting to walk toward a target across a frozen field. Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious. Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said. However, they did have the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference. "At that point, members began to hide paraphernalia and fundamentally put the well-being of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Police Commissioner Wagner. He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning. According to an autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thighs. "Too many families have been destroyed by the fraternity's harassment. At least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, in a statement. Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step by authorities is very important. A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members. Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and forming a criminal organization. "We not only want to hold the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday. Baruch College has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation with the chapter.
This is what will happen when the Fed hikes rates. A rate hike comes and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession. We know this. What we don't know is how long this will all last and how long it will last. In particular, for business, history offers little guidance on how to proceed. A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months. The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react. That's why Federal Reserve officials have been so vehement that investors shouldn't focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but rather on the time it takes for the rate to normalize. In fact, several variables play a role. In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been overdone. "The Fed's first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. In contrast, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal levels, but still at levels too low to trigger the seismic shock that many seem to fear. However, that doesn't mean there won't be an impact. Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might react, based on historical trends: As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while. Once the raise arrives, the impact isn't as dramatic. "There appears to be a tendency for asset returns to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, perhaps again reflecting the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes rates . More specifically, the market has been mostly up for the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Barron's Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. Deutsche Bank said the impact on stocks tends to come later in the appreciation cycle and the yield begins to decline. Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often fueled by interest rate hikes. In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before that could accelerate a recession. Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point if the Fed hikes rates. According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP has only fallen below 4.5 percent twice. Although the second quarter of 2015 came in at 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, expecting just 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed. Raising rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said. Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year and all eyes have been on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday. While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike this session, futures trading is only listing a 25 percent probability. "In our study, all cycles of increases from 1950 to the present have occurred in a super-cycle with accelerating momentum in GDP, dwarfing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began," says the report. In contrast, this is a decidedly slow recovery from what was the worst recession of the period under review. The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far. Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market. The main difference is that bonds act faster than stocks when they change their strategic course. For bonds, yields seem to reverse direction once the first hike/cut in the cycle occurs. At the end of the hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said. Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields to narrow between longer and shorter bonds, flattening the curve. High-yield bonds often produce better returns in such a climate, although "we remain cautious about expecting higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis. What's interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations. "Alongside the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote. Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve has flattened, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all hallmarks of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy. Overall, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive. Multinationals with high levels of debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and more expensive to fund their debt. "History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react overwhelmingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients. Firms with strong balance sheets have outperformed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate hikes. Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality peers by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively. Debt becomes a big problem. Companies with a high percentage of floating rates will lose the most, Goldman said. Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar. Savers could see gains from higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a carbon copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham The Conservative Member of Parliament has criticized the station for being "dumbed down" He argues it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals. He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just impersonating The Brits Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice programme, saying it wasn't very original. BBC Radio 3 is 'shifting' to Classic FM, claims a senior MP, adding new pressure on the station to prove it's doing something the commercial stations aren't. Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals. "Radio 3 seems - I hate to use the word 'dumb' - but it seems to be morphing into Classic FM," he said. He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December. The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be The Brits just under a different name. So if you're trying to do something different - these are two off-the-cuff examples where you're really just imitating what's already out there," said Mr Bingham. The BBC chief executive dismissed the allegations, arguing that the BBC "Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education. What I'm learning from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else. And there's a commitment to live music and making music, which is truly second to none."And I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new work is also really important," he said.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder on it work had to be done to engage audiences than they have in the past because the British are less informed about classical music Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of the BBC's production , which came under fire during the hearing at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee for stepping on its commercial rivals' toes. Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22m. Do you see why this program is often discussed as being unoriginal and not particularly distinctive? Lord Hall insisted the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way". He added that he wishes the company could "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series. However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or to spend fee-payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew the slowest in August and Black Friday may be to blame In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales. Last month saw its lowest result since records began in 2000. Online sales boosted three years ago as use of cellphones for shopping increased Experts believe November's Black Friday slowed spending For over a decade, the virtual has Shopping has boomed and many of the UK's high streets have been turned into ghost towns. But experts say there are now signs that online sales are flat, after new figures showed just 7 percent in the first three months of 2015. Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, up just 5 percent year-on-year. Experts say there are signs online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015. "If you look at the growth rates for previous years, going back to 2000, that has changed over time always developed," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian. He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started making purchases using their phones. It meant more people could shop online and people could do so in different environments, e.g. B. at home on the sofa. But now that's leveling off and we may see growth slow down. The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one reason for the slowing sales. Experts believe shoppers are holding back their purchases ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November. In the past year, five times the average number of shoppers have flocked to their computers to snap up their bargains, and some retailer websites have crashed. Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers battled each other over bargains, could discourage shoppers from making purchases. A study by the British Retail Consortium found that for every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online. For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops. At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in city center chains.
Muslims bury those killed in the crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca Saudi Arabia attributes the collapse in part to the huge Saudi Bin Laden group Last The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque. Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al Moaissem Cemetery. The funeral procession passed by the holy site, where just days before a construction crane crashed through the mosque's ceiling and onto the worshipers. The bodies were cleared for burial as the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured. The bodies of 29 worshipers killed when a crane fell through Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets. Among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell. Mr Akram was with his parents at the Grand Mosque before the start of the annual Hajj. Saudi officials have already given firm pledges that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands continuing to flock to the city. Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not in use. An Arabic version of the decree, released by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse. The news agency's English-language service did not report the detail, but said the company's management was banned from traveling abroad. Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month. The bin Laden group has not released any statements about the collapse of de Kran, and its representatives were not available for comment. The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not up to date safety measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists. Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project being spearheaded by the Bin Laden group. The bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on major construction projects. The late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son dispossessed of his family in the 1990s. The crane's crash came amid high winds and rain, just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the lifetime of every sane Muslim. Officials said 158 people remain hospitalized. Government officials ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to families of those killed and the same amount to those permanently injured. Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says days of cheap Eastern European artisans are over Brits increasingly employ artisans, says Veronique Laury Number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has risen leading to 200 more Screwfix shops targeting artisans opening at the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail It is claimed that Britons are putting down their hammers and brushes in favor of employing skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes if they are skilled with a If you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you seem to be in the minority these days. Britons are increasingly hiring handymen to do do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q. Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a large surge in the number of skilled tradespeople from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices has now been outpaced. As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets. Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q shops because eight out of ten in-store purchasing decisions are made by women. At the moment, the majority of the employees are men. She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that are showing more single female households doing more renovations than in the past. Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores. We need to shift this more towards a balance. Basically, half our customers are women with 80 per cent of the decisions about buying items made by women. Women play a large role in the decision-making process.Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of a UK leader in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 per cent women on its team, including its executive board and chief financial officer Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here. It wasn't difficult to find good women for our board of directors. Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores. Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Rate decision time for the Federal Reserve The world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision of whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade or not not. A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that just over half who last week thought the Fed would do so now think the Fed will hold on a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent. It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to ZERO. "For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may exit zero territory and begin a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The US economy is performing relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation. However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions. She has warned markets to brace for a hike, but signs suggest the odds against such a move are good. The decision is scheduled to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University Gunman Left Apology Letter After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning — and before shooting and killing his colleague later in the day — Shannon Lamb penned a note to say he was "sorry." in the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities said Tuesday. Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, an associate professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 am Monday morning and said he had shot and killed someone. Lamb told the 911 operator that police needed to send officers to his home. He said "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house who "won't bother anyone" but will probably be excited. The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it. Lamb gave no explanation for his shooting. When police arrived on the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which read: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me". After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life Monday night when cops surrounded him. University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination." Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also in a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship." Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years. The two divorced 15 years ago but have remained friends. O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19 and that she is "devastated". He said that Prentiss and their daughter were "absolutely best friends". Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who has been identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss. Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years. "She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said. Police said Lamb called relatives at one point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail." When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb overturned his car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself. Lamb received his PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a stressful few years. In 2001 he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer. The actor also reportedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession. All of this is sure to take its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months due to double fracture Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven. While this made the left-back cry and will rule him out of play for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope Shaw can play again this season. The injury was caused by a reckless 15th-minute attack from Héctor Moreno after Shaw, 20, broke into the PSV area. He was treated on the field for nine minutes and required oxygen before being rushed to the hospital. Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital." He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester. It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 and has a very difficult time and then plays fantastic and then this happens. In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on. He cried. I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture it takes six months and he won't play in the group stage. I hope he can play again this season. Moreno appeared happy to have escaped a red card and a penalty being awarded. Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, didn't penalize the Mexican. Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee was wrong. You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due. It was a very bad attack with both legs. A tweet on Shaw's account read, "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger." Related: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat The England defender has extra incentive to recover until next June with the European Championship in France. Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury." When a player leaves the pitch with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it. It is never our players' intention to hurt an opponent. Moreno suffered a broken leg while Mexico played Van Gaal's Holland side at the 2014 World Cup. "He's struggling because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu. It was not possible for me to see the moment. The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke. Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult something like this can be. I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry. PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better? There's one thing all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart. Unless you might be David Cameron. When asked by a child care system provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister settled on The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. seuss It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on SuperCamps' website, continuing, "Fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I enjoy reading to my kids because it always shines to give an image or a message that we have missed so far." All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead gives a synopsis of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand on the rather short original text. "Amid the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree "fulfilled", one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, is completely unknown. As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads in part like the synopsis of that of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website, beginning: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams." While he admits he's a no-nonsense father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment being ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, Thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite protests from the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, mustachioed creature "who speaks on behalf of the trees." Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row. A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron's constituency office. SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but made no other immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of expulsion from England's side but it's still tough Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task but when you see the squad England have chosen for the tour, one stands Repeat 3-0 Test series loss not on my map. I wouldn't rule out an away win. Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up and the community spirit is strong; they won't bear any scars from 2012, just a youthful positivity. With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for attack. Related news: Adam Lyth is out of the England Test squad to be replaced by Alex Hales. The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously difficult for me, as his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyze. In his seven Tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are results oriented. There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best picks. Long ago Lyth's course would have been lengthened, but he was in control of his own destiny. Hopefully if he snags more runs for Yorkshire then another chance will come. England manager Trevor Bayliss praised his demeanor even if he wasn't performing so well and I'm not surprised; he is above all a team man. The question of how much time a Test batsman is given to make his mark is a difficult one. Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine. Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games. The only reproach one can level was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at his best - but that lost opportunity is now in the past. Alex Hales comes in and he's a hitter I rate highly. He's an X Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us hard. He must be given at least the same chances as the ones before him, but of course that depends on the team's line-up in the United Arab Emirates. The idea of having Moeen hit next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up and I don't mind. I don't see why a batsman can't bat there and this left-hander has already shown he's one hotshot of a cricketer. Moeen may not have done his job for his Worcestershire County, but he's a number 3 for them and there's not much of a difference. My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001. He did three hundred runs in an instant and didn't look back. Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man. People might look at his stats -- an average of 31 with the stick and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a punt, but there aren't a huge number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth . He will learn a lot on this tour. Aside from the squad, England have made some smart additions to the coaching staff. The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as an adviser for the friendly could be a masterstroke. He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience having played in all conditions and against all attacks. Paul Collingwood arrives for the cue ball phase of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful drive to the setup. I've always felt he was cut out for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit. Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what has been said before. Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, won't be used in the one-dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I personally don't have a problem with that. While some will disagree, coaches and team builders don't set the schedule. And you have to remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results. Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp could gather momentum if the economy hits a slump by 2017. David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper by the day Difficulty encountered, even without the genius Jeremy's choice of "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to lead Labor or the TUC, which clashed over Europe on Tuesday. Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too. A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as mired in various crises as the EU happens to be and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-made agenda of fragmented concessions and disruptive treaty changes, most of which they don't want . In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they don't like it either when they jeopardize social protection. We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda. Prime ministers and finance ministers scramble to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, snap a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local notables, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform. It's always about me. My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to that point where they don't care if we stay or go. Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before things look bad for her, as is the case with the overly long-stayers like Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) happened. France's François Hollande is looking towards re-election or replacement in 2017. He is also a fading force. Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one. It's hard to imagine that they'll bend over backwards to help the Selfie Brits, whose energies would be better spent preventing Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most do have similar separatist tendencies. So some such ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects. "The renegotiation was a bust" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation." Europeans know how rapacious Fleet Street can be at their expense and what Eurosceptics the oligarchy of press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum that defeated our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2: 1 supported. You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made his name as an "EU-straight-bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s. For all his weirdness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were. This included the medley of tax-fearing scoundrels, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers. Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but realized that when you're in a cage with a hot gorilla, it's better to hand out bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner. Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum whirlwind, for Blair had placed the principle above the EU's unenacted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving him a back door opened. The press never forgave him for that either. But the kind Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of abandoning Neil Kinnock's Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s repeat, a mistake then and now. It may take time but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday. Corbyn's official position on Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving. He says that we should stay in a reformed EU. Well, outside of UKip's traditional blue-dye leanings and the wilder realms of Tory's Little Englishmanism, most people can probably say yes to that. It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" said to Benn on radio and television this week as the Boy Scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea. It reminded me of the 1970s when his elderly father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labor cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job. Hilary's fight was even more attractive. But fighting to stay "at all costs" - Benn's phrase - wasn't what McDonnell said, nor what by all accounts JC told his fellow campaigners and MPs at their Monday night retreat. Whatever Corbyn's sob bottom-up image is trying to convey - remember it touched even me - news discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal. It is right not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe, allowing him to take Labor's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said. Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so. But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes. As with his ambiguities on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant JC is not campaigning to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home. Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - making concessions to the British when it can all be pointless? The US is already quite frustrated by weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting effort by the Tory government in power, I was reminded of at Monday's launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum .
Experts slam Public Health England report on e-cigarettes Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said. Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes. PHE released the "policy report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence." But some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry. An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy basis" on which PHE based its key conclusion. Writing in BMJ, two other researchers have asked whether the claims are "built on rock or sand." Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness should." They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling. In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to express their opinions about the harms of different nicotine containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report. McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study. He also underwrote BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said. One of the 12 attendees at the meeting said it was receiving funding from an e-cigarette maker but not the funding it was previously reported to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added. The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper. Some other participants in this session are not known for their tobacco control expertise. The PHE Tobacco Management also attended the meeting. The group's research "significantly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products under most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote. However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report. McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a route for children or non-smokers to smoke" were premature. Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE's director of health and well-being, said BMJ's claims had been previously acted upon. He said: "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking." One in two lifelong smokers die from their addiction. All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still have to study the long-term effects. PHE has a clear duty to educate the public about what the evidence shows and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco. Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year. By clearly presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows like the Albert Square Soap. Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK broadcasters. He criticized the BBC for placing public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by smaller audiences, in fiercely contested time slots against the most popular shows from its rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4. After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years while at Channel 4. "I have problems with the idea of the BBC commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC's future. If you want to keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, at least put your production on programs that others don't make or commission. They air The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to get the widest possible support for their future. The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense of course. Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax would fund programs that could be funded without subsidies. The Voice is one such programme, EastEnders is another, both admittedly homegrown. Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it. "I'm struggling to see how this is public service television. I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all. Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame Chasing ratings is "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe it's the best way to secure long-term support." His comments on the BBC's most popular programs echo what the former Sky leader Tony Ball suggested that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003. Johnson said that the more niche public service programs "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't measure audiences, but they get the job done and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions of justifying £4bn in license fees," well , of course, we made all these obscure programs that nobody saw." They put her in a time slot where no one ever wanted to see her. On the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of this. Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you can get one here gets great value but for people who think the £150 is a lot of money wonder if that's true as they don't consume much of the BBC Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also pre- Committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission of “to inform, educate and entertain.” He said little of the BBC's production was now officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of her TV production and 0.1% in radio - and she should take the example of public television in Australia and Canada and change that to "inform, educate and entertain". On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said, the BB C should do more in areas like the Proms, which he said only a handful are shown on TV, and form alliances with commercial networks to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses. Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves. The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have frequencies too high for human hearing to hear. The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves. More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new technique, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to scan a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body to activate the body. Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease . Roundworms don't typically respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic air bubbles. The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms. The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm's cells. The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report Nature Communications. To create ultrasound-gated nematodes, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels. When he applies ultrasounds to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons. The technique shares some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light. But Chalasani said Sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique. Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and so can be launched into the brain from the top of the skull. "We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons transiently vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said. Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep! The ads put Britain's arms trade to shame Watch the Amnesty International Anti-Arms Fair video. Terrible Killer Drones! Ankle crushing leg shackles! cluster bombs! And stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace! The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to spotlight the UK Government's willingness to donate arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Center in London's Docklands. Related: DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian regimes flock to London But a separate campaign also results in many posters seen at bus stops and on the Tube trains requiring a second look. "Important announcement: Will you be traveling with DLR from September 15th to 18th?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into an image of a tank. In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair. The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland. A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped with distribution in London, using 'Ad Space Hack Packs', a £6 pack of Allen keys which are claimed to 'give access to around a third of the bus stop ad space on the planet gain." Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" amusing. One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group. According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and seek to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries. Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society. Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets commuters on the subway. The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was produced by advertising agency VCCP, who work for a charity with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free. VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun show promotion - through a blank space on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid." They toyed with inventing a more realistic dodgy corporate ad, but "bringing it in with bright colors and animation makes it stick more." "You have done a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," said Amnesty's Tom Davies. What we need now is British Government action and a guarantee that torture devices are not being trafficked on our doorstep. Perhaps the most creative art around the gun show comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products. In a press release, Saab revealed a US Army order for "the shoulder-shot AT4CS RS." These include a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding aftereffects inside the target." Whatever the cause, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Dorm Life Eleven years ago, I moved into a dorm as a self-absorbed 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smiles of those I teased - and to the numerous, lengthy complaints about others. Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules. Moving into dormitories ranges from mildly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying. It's tempting to chatter: People tell you where you're from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just one Yeast extract HAHAHA I'm in my room." Take a deep breath. And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest. It guides the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes caught fire and they were fire extinguishers. release people. People's rooms often turn into drink reception desks, movie night venues, and community gathering places, but they're also the places where people get dressed and adjust their underwear. Related: Don't think about starting a relationship at college. Introverts get rough treatment at college. Your room should be a sanctuary, but many dorms foster a room-to-room, strolling culture that is friendly and social, and can lead to lifelong friendships. This can be hell for someone trying to recover. Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I expended interacting with you." Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and text them instead of knocking. Speaking of knocking: do it. A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation. He saw some things. Make Friends by Baking. Since you're starting varsity at the height of baking mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less odd than the 1950s greeting, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I got you something baked. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions." Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends. Your roommates will feel compelled to chat and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise. Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker. Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat make people pretend to be asleep when you knock. Stealing groceries is a common crime in college dormitories. Of course stealing chicken is stealing, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea too? Check with the milk owner. Chances are they will say to help themselves even if they are cooking inside. When someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced about it than my roommate, who added dish soap to her milk to punish thieves. She is in prison now. You shouldn't make noise that distracts people from sleep or work. It's not just about being a decent human being, it's about being one of those people who live in glass houses, as the saying goes. A girl down my hall asked her neighbors if they mind turning the drum & bass down a little because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning. They responded with even louder music. When they finally finished at 5am, her neighbors kindly let her sleep for two more hours before she blared out her own music, locked her door, and headed for her three-hour exam. Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same college dorm? Conversely, wouldn't it be profoundly embarrassing if you mistook a roommate for your soon-to-be spouse, approach her, break up, and then have to see her every day and maybe see her drag all your mutual friends over to you? Heart goes its own way, of course - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense into your gut. In that thrilling moment when you realize someone left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between prank and bullying is finer than it seems. A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before it boomerangs. Teach a valuable and amusing safety lesson by hiding - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo. Lock her door and put her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't staple her belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then choosing "Software update". When ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install. Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message saying "Software update failed". To work around the issue, users are advised to either wait for the onslaught to subside or try to update via iTunes. The phone itself will walk you through the rest of the process. That could potentially mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a dedicated tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete. It's worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger during the update so the battery is charged. If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed as the phone may turn off midway and this could cause the update to abort.

FedEx earnings mixed, 2016 financial outlook downgraded FedEx reports disappointing results for its most recent quarter, and the shipping giant cut its earnings outlook to a full year on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs at its ground transportation service. The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacations. At this point last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season. The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's open. fedex corp said it would earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the earlier forecast. Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet. The lower outlook comes despite price hikes, which average 4.9 percent and take effect on January 4, and higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will come into effect from November. The company said it still expects earnings to improve year-on-year on cost cutting, higher revenue and growth in online retail. Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "delivering solid earnings considering weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade." The plans for the holiday job were announced a day later than rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year. For the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion. Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion. FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue at its express shipping unit to stagnate. But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground. In its most recent quarter, ground transportation revenue rose 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and auto-insurance. The Express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business. In premarket trading, about an hour before the open, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15. They ended Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists are spending two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. A mural of the United States looms over them at one end of the ornate, two-story boardroom. The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests above all else. The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize US employment and keep prices here stable. But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability. And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008. Although most data on the economy shows it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials fearful of amplifying that volatility by raising Bund yields -- even by a quarter percentage point. "Obviously the job market and inflation is going to be the primary thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co. "But I think if they were looking for an excuse, not raising the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said. There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market. About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week. However, financial markets are expecting a wait-and-see for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of a hike. This suggests the stock market will fall if the Fed hikes rates unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another hike is far away. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85. The action was prompted by expectations that Fed policy would keep rates up this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group. It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point," he said. If it does, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm financial markets lest they panic." Others Pundits argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to hike rates by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed, expect rate to rise Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers full employment. Wage increases have shown signs of recovery. And although inflation has remained consistently below the central bank's 2% target for the year, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices. The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tightening job market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. But financial markets around the world twitched late last month after China devalued its currency. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% from its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in China's economy would choke global growth. The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now down almost 10% from the May high. For Fed officials, the market turmoil is affecting the complex calculation of when to raise rates. "If the events in financial markets and the news of weakness in the Chinese economy hadn't occurred over the past few weeks, they would be tightening the reins at this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA's Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee. Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects. "There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said. The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be involved in its decision-making. But the bottom line is that the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world. The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years. Then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's mere suggestion in 2013 that the Fed could "tighten" its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe. In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interdependent, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the sustain global economy. Its decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management at Envestnet Inc. Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market moves that appear unrelated to economic fundamentals." Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee that campaigns for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example. A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite a limited discernible impact on US growth," Lacker said. A year later, the Fed officials reversed those cuts. The Fed should only prioritize financial stability issues during a major crisis like the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Rate Setting Committee. The recent turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said. "She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and makes no mention of financial stability and until that is changed I don't think it should be ahead of the curve.

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding Brazil's pediatric organization SPRS is attempting a shocking attempt to educate women about the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding. She does this by presenting images of babies suckling breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods. Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system. Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by approximately 500 calories per day. However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake isn't the only dietary adjustment moms should make. A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy eating in pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumors. Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet in the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings despite Nine's attempts to cover the loss of the Today Show leadership Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to cover the follow-up to the Liberals' loss of leadership, but it hasn't made much of a shift achieved in the ratings for Today. Nine's breakfast show was being broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to topple Tony Abbott. Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long streak of international television shows that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun. This distance disadvantage did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals compared to Today's 339,000. Today scored a slight increase from Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) ratings, but its number fell short of last Thursday's (343,000). Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months. In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000. At the beginning of the year, the gap ran between 40,000 and 50,000. So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000. This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning. The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament! Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking! Posted by TODAY on Monday September 14th, 2015 The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson. The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the New Zealand coast with his two children, garnered a very impressive 1.219 million viewers. Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney. Yesterday's result answered this with a clear "yes". Seven's The X-Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000). Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia. The first half hour (5:00pm to 5:30pm) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers. The second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000). On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half hour drew 520,000 viewers and the second half drew a whopping 720,000. Hot seat average 620,000. The drop in odds on The Chase Australia's second night will give Nine confidence that hot-seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30pm. The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to outperform The McGuires Show. Originally posted as 'Sunrise dominates while Today stays local'
The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose? secret revealed? ... Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor. The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in the utmost secrecy. And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose. But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three becomes two, you may have inadvertently given a hint as to who the victor will be. Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's finale. All three women lyrically opened up about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they like her want to be his partner. However, when the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Wood's final rose?", their answers could spoil the game as to who won the Bachelor's heart. Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name - besides themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood. Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship since day one. "From the moment I walked into the house and noticed [Sarah's] and Sam's energies, I felt like they were quite compatible, and I've felt that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows. "Sarah is down to earth, so much fun to be with," added Markoski. I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry. You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other. Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple. From her point of view, Mackay said last week's home visit made her realize that Wood could be "the one". "As soon as I saw him with my friends and family I realized that obviously this isn't just a game - I'm totally tuned into him now," she said. And when asked who Wood should vote for if not her, she was puzzled. "I don't know if I can say that," she said. I love the leftover girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana. The Bachelor airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten. Originally posted as Sarah First Choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career. Detroit and Seattle showed keen interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams who sent in inquiries after his impressive open practice day late last year. But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision. Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble like the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota. But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured. Tomsula continued to show his true colors in the post-match dressing room. Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them. Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne in his post-game press conference. 49ers sportscaster Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and get on with the next game. Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian following were hoping for his NFL debut. Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't have asked for a worse start to his NFL career, "It was a thing that happens, you take care of it just for the next game, and that's it," Hayne said. Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass at in his own in-goal area resulted in a try for Queensland. All in all, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old. Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, has been arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airfield. After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his democratic efforts were stymied.
Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday . Violence erupted in Rupandehi district, some 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu, on Tuesday night. Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs. Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before resorting to rubber bullets. Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said. It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, appeared to produce such a high death toll. The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political clout. There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group who want their own state. At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10, when the four major political parties signed a deal to carve up the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries. Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers sped up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April. Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could go into effect on Sunday.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde The US National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent chance of turning into the to develop into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours. Another well-defined low-pressure system roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Matching Funding Campaign to Raise $11M for Refugees Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a Matching Funding Campaign to raise $11M for humanitarian organizations aiming to help thousands of refugees who are have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries. Google took an unusually personal approach to announcing the call for donations on its blog. Rather than let a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experience. "Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote. I was lucky. But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help. The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Google said the first donations raised globally will be matched to $11 million up to a value of $5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief. Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year. Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya. Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Christian Plumb
For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful. The benefits of weight-loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study. It's too early to tell if slightly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatments. "The mortality data takes a long time to show anything," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery. Weight loss surgeries, or bariatric surgery, use different methods to decrease the size of the stomach. They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food. Over the years, obesity surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater. BMI, a measure of weight-to-height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9. A BMI of 25 or more indicates someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese. You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv. For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and gastric tube construction -- to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were slightly overweight. The average BMI among those who underwent the surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study. Meanwhile, among those who received nonsurgical diabetes treatments, BMI remained about the same at 29. Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had complete diabetes resolution and 28% had partial resolution. In comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent. In addition, outcomes in controls for blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found. The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood glucose levels over time. Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write. After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent. In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent. But this better "glycemic control" -- as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels -- did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues. The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery. By year five, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to achieve complete resolution of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%). While the new study doesn't show a five-year survival benefit from surgery, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix. In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years compared to a group who tried more conventional methods. Although the new study didn't show a survival benefit for the surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure. "That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group" with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said. Blackstone added that once the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30, people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously. "I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said. I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have hardwired their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse."
'It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe' - Dalai Lama - RT-News Europe cannot take in all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East. The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' homelands. The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis early in his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies. He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should come before the interests of individual nations or even continents. He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, while admirable, was not proportionate to the situation. "It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech. Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution. "Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to bring real peace and development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed. Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries. We must reduce the use of force. "The use of force has never solved these problems," he added. Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the violent US response triggered a chain of uncontrollable events. After 9/11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush, telling him that nonviolence is the way to solve this problem. "I know his motives were good, but he used violence and it has had unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children's use of hand sanitizer in past 4 years Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center. according to dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, said cases of hand sanitizer ingestion among children under 12 years old, poison control centers report, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014. "Children are getting their hands on these products with increasing frequency, and unfortunately, a percentage of them go to the ER," Lopez told CNN. He said some kids drink sanitizer on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or for a dare on social media. Videos on YouTube show youngsters drinking sanitizer just for a cheap experience. Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-based mouthwash to make a harder drink. Younger children can be attracted by the attractive scents of the disinfectants. "A kid doesn't think this is bad for them," Lopez said. Many of the more appealing (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented. There are strawberry, grape and orange scented disinfectants that are very appealing to children. Hand sanitizers contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol. Even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning, especially in small children. "It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City. Now, you wouldn't leave a slug of whiskey lying around, but people keep these hand sanitizers within reach of kids, and when kids get to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol. Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment. Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold for an adult to be legally intoxicated, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta. Nhaijah slurred her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room. Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen from drinking and hit her head, Ritchey said. "That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN. It could have been fatal to my child. Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes, and to keep hand sanitizer out of child's reach. Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with fatalities. In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing a toxic undeclared ingredient. Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as the active ingredient. In January, three fourth-grade students in New York state planned to poison their "mean" teacher by laying antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report. The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her Room Police considered the foiled plan to be "chatter" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Rumor mill: No disharmony at Celtic Griffiths downplays talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place but that he'll turn things around. Hearts set to fight SFA over Neilson allegation and Warburton wary of January signings who could shatter squad unity Dons increase Celtic lead to five points ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five point gap between themselves and Celtic. Griffiths downplays talk of disharmony There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic which Griffiths dismissed out of hand. The latter insisted he and his team-mates are not under heightened scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch leaders. I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it. Lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with Rangers . De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?" It's because the Rangers aren't there. People here aren't just talking about the return of Rangers. They talk about the Old Firm. They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them. There's a lot of excitement in the old firm games and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games. I'll turn things around, Deila swears. RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic have to fight but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around. After losing to Malmö and being knocked out of the Champions League, they lost to 10-man Aberdeen, who are now clear at the top of the table by five points. But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad times before and we'll be back." Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible. I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening. We feel the same way - but we have to go further. We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players better. Standing together now is so important. Warburton wary of January transfers Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was eyeing some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing newcomers and insists he is not the Ibrox's unit - wants to disturb Kaders. The ex-Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window." The players coming in the summer have that pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season. The team is really good. Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need. Celtic target Michu hinted at retiring Swansea striker Michu, who is in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he may retire if his contract with the Swans expires. The 29-year-old has struggled with an annoying ankle for two years and failed to make the exit from Wales this summer. Hearts suspended for SFA battle over Neilson's comments Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2 but the defender's red card was later overturned - Collum's third red card in eight months was revoked. Neilson stands by what he said, insisting "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance." Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle The incorrigible Hibee was rebuked after he admitted singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel. The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014. "It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It's safe to say , not going back to Tynecastle unless it's playing for Glasgow Celtic." Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United board still has faith in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch. I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us. We'll get the lads back on their feet," said Donnelly. McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "ugly". Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh straight league win , which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty McInnes said: "There isn't a team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that has games of that nature too didn't win."
Unemployment in Scotland is flat, while in the UK as a whole it is rising. Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while for the UK as a whole the number of people out of work rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period. Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK's 5.5 percent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number employed now at 2,612,000. The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent. Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy." It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom. In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Why I Will Witness an Execution in Oklahoma Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death. If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection. He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death. The invitation first came through his best friend in January, and although I was shocked, I accepted. As the day drew near, I began to fear. So why should I do it? I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty. It would offer a unique perspective. It's true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who gets elected. Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five. Whoever is chosen will observe it without emotion. I can not do this. I will be seated next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two and a half hour visit. i like the guy We often laugh a lot when we speak. The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see. I just have to try to remember all the details. An Oklahoma journalist took to Twitter to accuse me of sacrificing my impartiality. Here's the lesson. Tell the inmate's story any way they want and you'll gain access. I complained to her. She conceded that she "could have worded it better," but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong. Richard Glossip took issue with some of the things I said and wrote. He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did. I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time. But he wants an international reporter to be there to write. If he dies, he thinks public relations will help the anti-death penalty movement. Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me. If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've been doing. I don't want to go into all the details again here. I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent. His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a perpetrator of the act. But I think there's a strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder. I am sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence. I believe his execution is wrong. And from this perspective I will see him die. I can't claim to be really objective. There will be other reporters you can contact for this. What you'll get from me is what it's like to see a man die a needless death.
Man persuaded to come out of Canning River after wet police chase The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry while coaxing the Canning River man. An attempt by a Perth man to get rid of the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy water, just yards from a police officer who was trying to "gently coax him to return to shore." Canning Vale Police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday. When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape towards the Canning River. But he didn't get very far. "He was standing in the water - and he said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Senior Sergeant Sandel Castledine said. Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates". "Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said. Championship soccer player Ben Cousins provides a memorable example. In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a breathalyzer and then attempted to swim across the Swan River. His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to pull out of racing Peter Moody alleges that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy in his stables for the past year and threatened to pull out of the race immediately. He targeted Racing Victoria's stewards and integrity department, claiming they were running a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday. Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab at Lidaris, which he cannot explain. He had held back for 18 months over the spying allegations and didn't want it to "look like grapes hanging too high." "I intended not to say anything about it and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it's all coming out at once," Moody said. You know it went on. Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said. I'll go home tonight and sleep well. I want to walk around with my head held high and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them. If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore. I then have to think about what to do with my license. Earlier, Moody blasted the bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable. "Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him employment in my stables to gather information about what I had within of my stables," Moody said on Racing.com. You obviously think I'm a scammer. If that's the case, surely they should be touching their noses because they failed in trying to touch me. Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today. Should that make me think it's getting personal? Has the RVL acted cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry? Am I bad for the industry? Am I that bad for the industry? Maybe people out there think it's me. Maybe they need to take my license away and cast me out, and I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think about it now. But I've gotten to the point now where I don't care, and that makes me sad. That makes me really sad. I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision. I have the support of my family and I can walk. The coach's levels of frustration have built with Lidari's long-running cobalt probe, and the late scratching led him to say he "could throw his license over the table." Moody, best known for his coaching of undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after applying a pack of mud or clay to the horse's legs, which was against the rules. "It's against the rules of racing. I have to take full responsibility for it," he said. "One of my staff put mud on the leg by mistake. It could have been like that last night. It could have been like that all day yesterday, which it was. But it was like that on race day too. Moody could with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An inquiry into this matter has been opened. It's a joke. People who make these rules know nothing about the horse. "We all recognize that we need rules, but here is you've gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after hit-and-run Police arrested a man over the weekend after he hit and run in Cobram after colliding with a cyclist. The cyclist was helicoptered to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning. Police said the motorist drove on without stopping to help the injured driver. A 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton on Monday. He is expected to be charged with hit-and-run and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences. The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized. He is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims Melbourne Storm manager Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as "agenda-setting" by two NRL Premier League favourites. Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm's players to "wrestle" with his team during Storm's epic win in Friday night's qualifying finals in Sydney. Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his side achieved Saturday night's Finals win over North Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a "prime example" of rugby league and said the Queensland duo weren't "too good" at wrestling. Bellamy defended his team's tackle, saying that when it comes to tackling, they only focus on their "contact." Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two top coaches gave him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team. "It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday. I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques in the whole year. But in the last six weeks we've made our contact on tackles a real focus and that's turned the tide for us. Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to coach. So he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him. It's funny how this keeps popping up this time of year. Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football. Wayne speaks of exciting football. He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said. I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a damn "But now he has a team that can play and we see that as exciting, especially his young players with their speed. That's the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players. He made that statement in the Year 2010 now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like anthony milford and ben hunt so they can play like that i build more confidence because they say those things because they are a bit concerned about playing us.6 weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roosters game had a higher yield bnis scored as the Broncos vs. Cowboys game. The Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12? Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is that an exciting game? Or is taking breaks and not scoring something exciting? For me, it's the schedules. If they mention us, it means we're going to run into them at some stage. The Storm team is off this weekend as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the Prefinals at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbians on $200,000 bail after drug charges A man who could face a life sentence for attempting to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail. Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August. Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina later that morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo. Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's attorney argued that there was no evidence he attempted to possess the entire quantity and that the café could have been for an innocuous reason. Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic's risk of absconding. He has clear ties with Serbia. He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday. In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts. Maksimovic's mother and stepfather jointly offered $200,000 bail as security to secure his release "Reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that requiring a $200,000 security deposit is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said. But that alone will not be enough to deter him from not appearing, he warned. Maksimovic was released on bail on conditions that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and observe a 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg uses girls' phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit pictures of child abuse. Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user. The girl later woke up to discover the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand. She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother. Police took action and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms to look for indecent images of children. Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it as it would lead to "pedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a cop to scare them". Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people. He admitted the searches on the computer were done by him but said it happened , because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.He said he did to lure her. He said he gets sick in the head when he drinks and said he then wants to see pictures of the rape and murder. Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she called out her mother and was trembling and weeping. She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused about it. The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him. Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, breaching conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing to have been released on March 24 of this year. Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not appear on the sex offenders' register because it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense. Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed sentencing until October for background reports on social work. Hogg was granted bail in the case but was remanded in custody pending hearings on other pending cases. He was placed on the sex offenders' register before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers false speech in Parliament Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year. He was unharmed, but video of the fall quickly went viral on social media. The opening of Parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to boo at Mr Mugabe's speech. For the past month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in Parliament - the speech he was repeating on Tuesday. Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their cellphones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech. "The message comes from a number that is not displayed but it is titled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech. She warns the MPs concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer in effect. The chief spokesman said the Morgan Tsvangirai-led party was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to Cut Up to 30,000 Jobs Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the company's services. Later this year, HP will split into two public companies and separate its computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services businesses. The expected job cuts will result in a charge of over $2.7 billion beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement. "These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation. "Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses to help companies transition to a new style of doing business," said Whitman. As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses," according to a company statement. It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley." HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices. The move from HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in the space, based on the belief that narrowly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal FC captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates need to be behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dynamo Zagreb game Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it's only September and provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan there's no reason why he shouldn't already can play again before Christmas. That optimistic scenario already means Wilshere is certain to miss at least four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships is certainly still in doubt. The big shame with this current issue is that Wilshere ended last season strong after suffering a separate ankle injury and then got back to his old swing during preseason. "This kind of injury doesn't threaten your career," said Wenger. It's a bone that didn't heal well. It's no big deal. This was just an accident. It wasn't related to his ankles or any injuries he had previously. That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is an inherent risk of further injury whenever a player attempts to return mid-season. An uncomfortable pattern also develops. Premier Injuries Ltd's investigation records 23 different illnesses for Wilshere since his debut six years ago. He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons. The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08. Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rates over the last season will continue. "Sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a vulnerable period, a time where you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said. Jack is young enough to get over this. I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will and that he will have a career of the kind that he deserves. Arsenal begin their Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is set to rotate within the team. Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start. Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott. "I'm trying to keep my balance and give the players who need it a little breather," said Wenger. Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe. Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games after launching the "invincible" campaign last season. The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale. This year it was the 10th in Zagreb. Wenger believes Arsenal learned the lesson of last season's Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by distant hopes of his management guiding the club to their first European triumph. "This drive is immense," said Wenger. It has never worked at Arsenal. We were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I've been in business long enough to be realistic. We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that's giving us serious lessons about male friendships The lack of similar portrayals on shows is evident, especially given how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as has suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high. In 2013 it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than women. In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help, if you need them. Friendship is at the heart of the fight to complete this challenge. A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovery doubled. For those who are not depressed, a circle of sane friends halves the risk of mental problems. But of course you have to have friends first for a friendship to work. In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact. Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even when in reality isolation dominates. This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly. And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness. The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned on its head. Each character was defined not by their work but by their personality, which shone through interacting as a friend. The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments in cozy armchairs watching football, and Ross' longing for Rachel — it all came from knowing that men can definitely relate, even if they often hold back, fully to their feelings to explore. As one counselor told me:... "my listening role to people who are feeling depressed and suicidal really showed me how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference." The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends. The old saying "I can handle it" has a tremendous impact, as does the feeling that speaking openly about problems is perceived as a weakness." Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to to offer longer-term coping mechanisms. She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships. As much as my objective underdog status over the phone may help people in moments of distress, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends. And so, if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend with the setting completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk or, even better, if you see someone lounging in Starbucks, give them gifts Give him a smile and say hello You never know what a difference your friendship could make Friends becomes friends aired on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG crush Malmo Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo. Di Maria scores in his Champions League debut on Tuesday, helping PSG pass Malmo. Here is the game report and reaction to the game. Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday. Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champions but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani struck in the 61st minute. scored a header goal in the minute. With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualification for the knockout stages but an improvement towards the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns. But while they got the points, it wasn't a classy game from Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was later substituted off in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999. "It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so winning 2-0, causing problems for our opponents and looking back with confidence is a good start, even if there are certain things we've learned over the course of the game of the season still have to be perfected," said Blanc. "It bodes well. We wanted to win and we won, although I regret not scoring another goal or two." Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes to the Paris side, who held a 2-2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but he was outmaneuvered by Di Maria in the fourth minute. The Argentine winger was dubbed as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was acquired by Manchester United last month and he hinted why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defence , before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net. However, if anyone thought PSG would pull off a big win, they were disappointed. Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that stage, started with nine internationals on the field and were tough opponents with a five-man defense and two lined up deep in midfield. But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic that went wide of Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack. Instead, PSG gave themselves up at times, with a few bad passes and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who blundered on no fewer than five tries in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart. Still, he showed far more skill when putting his team-mates into play and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria converted into a turning shot that was deflected wide of the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute... The second goal came finally just past the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fished in Maxwell's left cross. That put an end to any thoughts of Malmo getting back into the game and only an excellent point-blank intervention from Wiland to stop David Luiz kept the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed at the end. Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a notch above his team and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year. Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level. The qualifiers are not enough." Hats off to Paris! It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, battered by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt-repayment plan. London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold around £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay down its own debt. The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling as commodity prices fall as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and devastates markets. The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading. The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher. Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay down around a third of its $30 billion debt. The company sold the new holdings at 125p per share, a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's closing price. It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group. Concerns over long-term stunted growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices are down 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States later this month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday. The visit, Xi's first official visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said. The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks. "President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common concern, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," adds the statement. XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September. Obama and Xi are expected to address a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over alleged cyber espionage by China and its growing assertiveness in disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Downplays Diversity in Filmmaking Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she wasn't needed behind the scenes. During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown when she emphasized the need for alternate perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen script. "When we talk about diversity, do it with the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show," Damon assured. Brown reacted in shock, offended disbelief and exclaimed "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as The Martian actor's comments solidified. Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists. "I want to challenge people to think - whoever the director is going to be - about how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said. The only black person and she's a hooker who gets pounded by her white pimp. The Dear White People producer lobbied finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights to the film; Damon countered that directing her "might end up giving us something we don't want." After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon's comments. Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her - this is SO WHITE it hurts". The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted. Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of societal debate. After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a national impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color. In February, singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the presentation of the nominated Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. "Albums still matter," he said. Like books and black lives, albums still matter. More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck asking if the group should be considered a hate group. "The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said. It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West. Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' Crowns First Champion Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million grand prize. The competitive show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, had never seen a contestant complete all stages of their obstacle course. During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final. The final task involved climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds. Britten completed the task on time, becoming the first athlete to complete the grueling Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner. Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought win, still in shock at winning the $1 million Grand Prix. "I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never made or had more than $10,000 to live on," Isaac told E! over his pile of money. So all of a sudden.. how I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown. Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite being the first to finish the course, Britten doesn't receive any prize money. According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person. "If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it," Weed said. How much money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he receives the great reward. I don't think he holds any grudges about it. He's so happy right now that he did what he did. He received tons of awards from fans. He's such a great guy and a family man. He's a hero to his kids and his wife. Geoff said to me, "If anyone hits me, I'm glad it's Isaac." And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they reversed the roles. America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, with filming slated to begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't a particularly fun one for the Detroit Tigers. Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now bottom of the American League Central. The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday. The Twins squandered a one-half promotion opportunity with the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard berth. For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-word that had been so elusive for much of the second half of the season. "All wins are fun no matter what," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus. Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept up his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth, and then again in the ninth. Simon (13-9) served 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs. It was only his third successful start in his last nine games. "I want to end this year strong," said Simon. It's hard to shoot every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very focused. Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August. It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th. "He swung the bat well," Ausmus said. He looked good in (batting practice), looked a lot better in the bullpen, and he put it right into the game. With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game. Center fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double at left field line. Right fielder Aaron Hicks caught a bunt, and Simon struck out second baseman Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy. Hardy ran over Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of designated rookie hitter Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen. With a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second, Verhagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play. It was the major league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play. After Detroit added an insurance run at the bottom of the ninth inning, Mauer hit and scored an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon Score of 5-4. However, the right-hander outpaced Sano on three pitches for his fifth save. Detroit benefited from a still unmoving Phil Hughes at the start of the game. The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who was taken off the pre-game injury list after missing more than a month with a back problem. "Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got going and felt like I was going to throw some pretty good pitches there in the third inning." After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes dropped a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler. A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought in Victor Martinez, who hit a single up the middle on the first run of the game. Victor Martinez maintained his 0-21 winning streak with the runners in the scoring position. Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed up with a single down the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was knocked out trying to get to third, ending the threat. The Tigers advanced in the second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0. "It was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor. He didn't hit very well, but he got the spot right. Hughes was on a pitch count, not scoring in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J. eighth. Hughes had three runs with six hits and one walk with four strikeouts. NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired with a throwing shoulder injury. He is given by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007. Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's start. With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is left off the injured list to start against the Twins. Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a swap with LHP David Price on July 30. He has been absent since August 20 with a right hip strain. The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game streak at Target Field on Wednesday. Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73).
Xi urges opening economy more broadly to the world The economy must open more broadly to the outside world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday. "China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Guiding Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform. Promoting start-ups and pushing ahead with reforms will bring new impetus and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said. The leadership group has passed a series of policies, including a blacklist regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to raise private capital, and overhauling the resident registration system. Following the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies not eligible for investment. The system is gradually being tested and improved through test programs. The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said. The government will also relax controls over the powers delegated to companies and ensure companies choose how to conduct their business. The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth. More areas will be opened up to private investment in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors. "The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said. In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residency or the "green card" by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process. Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practice their profession and appointing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting. The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
