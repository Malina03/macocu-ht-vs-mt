Obama receives Netanyahu The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly. The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East. But the meeting is also supposed to be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution. The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years. Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lacking will in the peace process. The deal Obama promoted over Iran's nuclear programme has further worsened their relationship. In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was seen in part as an affront to Obama. The speech had not been discussed with Obama, who had refused to meet with him, citing the upcoming election in Israel.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: Germany's five most exclusive residential areas Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea tidal flats. In the street, a square metre of a thatched-roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros. "On Sylt, the supply of properties is naturally limited," the study says - hence the high price. A new study shows in which special locations a square metre costs the most. Of course, 18.70 euros per square metre for a student flat in Munich is not really low. But in contrast to Germany's top residential locations, the price seems like peanuts. The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square metre at dizzying heights. Several tens of thousands of euros are nothing - per square metre, mind you. But well, if you can afford it ... By the way: Munich, for once, is not in the lead.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and Götze Double scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller is simply on a roll. A lucky goal by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - and then everything went right. A commanding start to the Champions League season. World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to "Mission Milan" in the cauldron of Piraeus. Coach Pep Guardiola's team deservedly won their opening match in the Champions League against Greek record champions Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's brace (52./90.+2) and Götze's goal (89.) with 3:0 (0:0). The twelfth success in a row should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the trophy to Munich at the third attempt. Muller's 28th Champions League goal to give Bayern the lead came courtesy of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed a shot intended as a cross from the world champion to pass. "We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 passionate fans - and the Munich team kept its word. They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining. Piraeus had won its last six home matches in the top flight, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin. In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3). But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cups with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim. They were brave in their attacking efforts, but often too unimaginative. Attacks were too often initiated by shifting play to left-winger Douglas Costa, who rarely broke through against former Braunschweig man Omar Elabdellaoui. Müller had more luck from the right when his cross from the right half of the field hit the top left corner of the goal. In the 67th minute, the world champion missed a possible 2:0. Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in half one. First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown knocked the Pole's header off the line (26th). Then with a direct shot, which goalkeeper Roberto saved with his knee (35.). Although Bayern played their usual dominant game, Piraeus were able to make pinpricks. But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable. For example, when he deflected a shot by Ideye over the bar (56th). In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a four-man defence with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which did well. Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat out. The World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training session, said sporting director Matthias Sammer on "Sky": "Anyone who wants to make something else out of it, that's already malicious." Guardiola also opted against him for the first change when he brought on Kingsley Coman for the stricken Lewandowski (59th). Götze came on late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with Müller adding to the tally with a penalty. Before the match, riots broke out in the stadium. After a small group of Bayern fans, some of them wearing hoods, had apparently provoked the supporters of the hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and used batons against the Munich supporters. At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium injured.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth Smokers not only damage their lungs, but also their teeth - a long-term study in Potsdam suggests. The good news is that the risk drops quickly if you give up. Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth at an early age. This is the result of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several members of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam. Compared to non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely. The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants. The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasises the DIfE. Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors emphasise. The connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammations in smokers. It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries. The researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research" that people who stop smoking can reduce their risk within a short time. However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, explained lead author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England. People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens your lifespan." Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age. In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by edentulism, the DIfE reported. Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss. The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne Archaeological finds have been made again on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne. Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday. Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called ground monuments. The museum is always consulted as the specialist office for archaeological ground monuments in all construction projects in the Cologne district. The archaeologists have now made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard. From text documents, it was already known that a fortress had stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained. In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman hit by goods train After a young woman had an accident at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police are asking the public for help. Early on Wednesday morning, at around 1.40 a.m., the woman, coming from the direction of the station building, crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach. According to the Federal Police, the train hit her, causing her to suffer serious injuries. She received emergency medical treatment at the scene and was taken to hospital by rescue workers. The investigating officers have no information about the reason why the young woman crossed the track at night. The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents may have heard sounds. Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are possible witnesses. Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained by calling the free 24-hour hotline of the Federal Police on 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system. The controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system that functions much more like traditional courts. "We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation. The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA. The German government announced its support. TTIP is supposed to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people. The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court. They are to come in equal numbers from the EU, the USA and third countries. For the first time, a second instance is also envisaged. It would allow appeals against judgements. Up to now, the parties to the proceedings agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility to appeal against their judgements. In the discussion of the past months, it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented. In the long term, she said she wants to work towards an International Investment Court. Disputes between Chinese companies and EU states, for example, could then be settled there. Investor-state arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly demanded by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP. The traditional arbitration tribunals are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, undermine national laws or push through a lowering of consumer and environmental standards. In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient. Above all, they criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta). German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress. He said that the Commission's reform took into account essential points that German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel had worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring. The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table. The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans. The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the business community's ability to take legal action by introducing too many new rules. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged by this, it said. It remained unclear on Wednesday when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded. Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013, but the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA so far. Originally, a framework for the agreement was supposed to be in place by the end of this year. This deadline is no longer considered tenable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on stage in Cologne's Prime Club (today: Luxor). Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen. The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven's lecture. He uses various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, to tell us what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs are about. Where they originated and what it is like there, in his homeland. Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative maniac. With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear, which harmonically nestle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the fantastically opulent at any time. Rumour has it that "Michigan" is the first part of an audacious series: each of the 50 US states is to be sung about in succession. But already in 2004 and close to the Rhine, "Seven Swans" was released and positively breaks certain expectations. Stevens appears reduced here. Live, guitar and banjo are enough for him. A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series. With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a widely celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005. Exuberant in ideas and stylistic finesse. The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing from any annual best list of the influential music media. After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic set pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010). This sixth proper studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and reverb. Having long since left the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations. Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band. In Hamburg's dark Mehr! Theatre in Hamburg, he mainly presents "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March. Although almost 2000 guests are now sitting spellbound in their chairs here, Stevens, who has clearly matured, returns to intimacy and folk. Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play their way through the broadly enriched album. One hears from the audience: the performance is "more opulent" and one could "basically throw the record away" with it. Only for an encore does Stevens thank the audience modestly, play a few older songs acoustically and finally bow out to thunderous applause.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On a Bieber expedition in Berlin Justin Bieber, megastar. A mere 21 years young, a linnet with a fancy hairdo. The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth 100 million euros. More likely even more. Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin. And the U17 generation is going crazy. Like Wiktoria Rudzinska. The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton". Not bad. Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday. Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland. Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin's luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz. The Bieber Building: this is where her idol, whose posters hang in heaps in Szczecin, has been living since Monday evening. The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mum Ewa earns in half a year. If that. She says: "Actually, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade at grammar school." "I'm fulfilling a dream for her". Compulsory education? Who cares? The fans don't. Not even Bieber himself. He's got it made anyway. He collected three million dollars for the commercials during the Super Bowl break, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company brought many, many dollars into Bieber's account. And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects. When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, one is amazed at the window pane. He is said to have made more than 100 million this way. Some say the hype has gone too far. Others point out that Bieber is currently number one in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean? Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, is not interested in all the zeros for the time being. At least he pretends not to.
Pegida poster gives Lebanese the potato kebab idea Potatoes or kebabs? It's possible to have both - in the potato kebab developed by the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay. Inspired by the slogan "Potato instead of doner kebab" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer. He got the idea from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the slogan "Kartoffeln statt Döner" (potatoes instead of kebab), which he had seen by chance on TV. Since then, a barbecue skewer has been turning in his shop, stocked with meat and potatoes. "This is multiculturalism for the stomach," says Alhay. The Lebanese has since registered the idea with the patent office in Munich. According to the office, it has recently been protected as a utility model. Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes are in the skewer. Only this much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks. The culinary international understanding also goes down well with his customers.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees. Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to still find warm water. A swim in the North Sea or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather short pleasure. Some people won't go to the sea: the water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD). The Mediterranean, on the other hand, will continue to offer bathing temperatures: in the east, it will even reach 29 degrees. In the Adriatic Sea it peaks at 25 degrees, in France at 23 degrees. The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Officials of Aich/Dob on trial for embezzlement Two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob had to answer for embezzlement and tax evasion at the regional court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday. The defendants pleaded not guilty. One of them had also been charged with abuse of office. He was acquitted of this charge in May. The current trial was adjourned. According to senior public prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged during the preliminary investigation that the defendants used money from the association's accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011. He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros. The sports officials are also charged with financial offences. This fact was ruled out by the chairperson of the jury panel, Judge Michaela Sanin. It is to be heard at a later date. Regarding the accusation of embezzlement, the defence explained that at no time did the association suffer a financial loss. The sports officials had only charged expense allowances and had led the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to about 600,000 shillings (approx. 44,000 euros) in 2001. "At that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or do we close it down?" said one of the defendants, whose bread and butter occupation is auditing large businesses at the tax office. Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he decided to take on this task. With all the risks. "We advanced money and deposited our life insurance policies with the bank as collateral," he said during the interrogation. It had been agreed with the association: They can manage the money freely, but no debts may be incurred. Furthermore, it had been decided - with corresponding financial success - to pay out the expense allowances retroactively up to 1991. Therefore, part of the expense allowances had only been paid out years later, namely from 2003, when there had been a plus in the account. The former chairman explained that this was the reason why lump-sum and not detailed debits appeared. The two defendants managed the accounts and savings books together, said the second defendant. The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail. The answer was that the association was not interested in the details of the financial management; the only important thing was to be debt-free. In 2011, when investigations were launched against one of the officials for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association's account. These were reserves, the defendants explained. This securities account was in the name of the second accused and, according to his testimony, was not known to the association. "Why?" the judge asked. The interviewee did not know the answer for a long time. Then he finally said that he had believed that this was the best thing for the association. If something had happened to him, nobody would have known about the money, the prosecutor said. The functionary justified himself by saying that his co-defendant had been informed. This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages". Why compensation for damages?, the judge and the public prosecutor wanted to know. The first defendant explained that he had not agreed to this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage. But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "You're all off the hook with that one". "Am I a legal representative?" he asked. Furthermore, the functionary said that he had never received a cent of salary, he had only charged mileage allowance and allowances. He added that he had charged the association 1,000 euros per month in allowances, but that the actual expenses had been much higher. The defendants were unable to produce precise documents for the early years. They explained that these had not been kept after an audit in which everything had been judged to be correct. The second defendant had also received mileage allowance. All withdrawals had been made in cash and he had had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement. The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs In addition to the layoffs that have been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut more jobs when it splits up the company. There is no end to the job cuts at US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP). The US technology company plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate division as part of its restructuring. This is expected to save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday. It said the move would lead to a special charge of about $2.7 billion, which would start in the fourth quarter. The 55,000 job cuts, which have been ongoing for three years, have not yet been completed. HP still employed about 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 financial year. Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 per cent in after-hours trading. The company from Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services. Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange. The world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo has recently been hit by disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services. In the third business quarter ending in July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 per cent. Turnover fell by 8 per cent to just under 25.4 billion dollars. This means that revenues have fallen in 15 of the last 16 quarters. HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts. The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has been slow to respond to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online. Whitman's restructuring plans call for a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflicts: majority support anti-IS training mission Direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, meet with overwhelming rejection: 54 percent were against it, 35 percent were in favour. The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is seen as positive by 61 per cent. 24 percent are against intervening in the conflict. 51 per cent of those surveyed reject cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, 20 per cent would be in favour. 29 percent could not decide.
Cars: Second press day at the 66th IAA The focus of the show until 27 September is on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility. After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects". The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday. The organisers, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), expect about 900,000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Violence erupts at Serbian-Hungarian border Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke. Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint. He reported by telephone: A group of refugees broke through the border. Behind them a police line had formed and a water cannon was ready behind the policemen. 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers. The officers first used pepper spray continuously. Then the police used tear gas. A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees. This broke up the group. The refugees now retreated somewhat, waiting. A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone. Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed. Other refugees slumped and suffered from shortness of breath. Serbian police press officers also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is restructuring the group Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring. The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with better organisation alone. The restructuring will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs. Meanwhile, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union. Lufthansa is reorganising its corporate structure and upgrading the low-cost subsidiary Eurowings. The airline announced on Wednesday that the aim of the realignment is to contribute around 500 million euros per year to earnings from cost and revenue synergies. Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have an executive board member responsible for passenger business. The low-cost airline Eurowings is to be developed as independently as possible. Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team around CEO Carsten Spohr. With the reorganisation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future. Until now, the organisation of the 120,000-strong company was complex. The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros. New negotiations with pilots In the wage dispute with the pilots' union Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the strike was halted by the courts. This was announced by the union. The topic of the talks is to be the retirement regulation for pilots. Cockpit wants to come to viable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a forecast record result". The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months. The background to this is, apart from the transitional provision of pilots, the savings concept "Wings". It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group's own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.
Paintings by Leena Krüger are on show at the Künstlerhaus under the title "Morning Train to the South". The Finn, who has lived in Göttingen for a long time, has put together a selection of untitled works for the White Hall of the house, which encourage her viewers to take a mental journey.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses in Eckental in central Franconia for people who don't have much money. For refugees, for example - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also single mothers and low-income earners. "I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview Thousands of refugees will be pushing onto the housing market. Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how affordable housing can be created quickly: He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project. Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing onto the housing market. What solution do you offer? Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability. Because the people stay here to a large extent. In view of the influx of refugees, we will need sufficient living space for the next decades. A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution. Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space. It facilitates integration. It's different when you put people in apartment blocks. Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each. Each housing unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room. It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back. Then the houses can easily be converted according to their needs. How high are the costs? Gildner: The price for 160 square metres of living space per house is 184,000 euros, not including the land. That is manageable. The construction took six months. That is reasonable. Did the building regulations complicate your plans? Gildner: In terms of building law, I went through with my project correctly. What always makes it particularly complicated is the looming sword of Damocles, special construction, and the parking space ordinance. Scary. It is still assumed that anyone who creates three flats in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces. Only in the cities there is not enough space for that. And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars. How did the residents react to your terraced house project? Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers. Which is definitely not true. But aren't you intensifying the competition for affordable housing? Gildner: The truth is that we have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury flats have been built that hardly anyone can afford. The message of my project is that ordinary people need housing too. Not only refugees, but also single mothers and low-income earners. I show how you can still build cheaply and well today. That's what it's all about. Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the Formula 1 world championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack". The world championship runner-up emphasised before the start of the decisive seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose". 53 points separate the runner-up from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton before this Sunday's night race in Singapore. The Briton has already won seven of the season's twelve races and will also start the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite. The 30-year-old Briton won the race in 2009 and last year. It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix. A haze has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissingen Chess Club has a prominent member The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players. The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who has stayed in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times to take the cure. Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and an honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke. Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which Chairman Alfred Klein accepted. This makes it possible to admit chess players who cannot afford the membership fee. Youth work and the search for talent are also to be promoted. Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the "Rot-Weiß" tennis club will be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
Saludis and the Antonistift Centre for the Elderly have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point on Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz. In addition to counselling, people can also attend courses there. The Social Foundation is moving down from the mountain into the city centre. More precisely, to Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz. A new neighbourhood office was recently opened there. Here, right next to the shopping market, senior citizens and those seeking advice can now get information on questions such as nursing care insurance or benefits from health and nursing care insurance companies. For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that caring relatives are often left alone. Yet there are endless questions. "It is also not uncommon for many services provided by the insurance companies not to be claimed because the complexity of the insurance policies is hardly understood," explained the new hostess Jutta Weigand, who, as Head of the Division for Care for the Elderly, is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus". In addition to counselling, the new neighbourhood office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness. For this purpose, Saludis was brought on board. Therefore, one can take advantage of additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment. The services offered by the Senior Citizens' Centre and Saludis complement each other perfectly. Saludis stands for prevention, care and rehabilitation. "The senior citizens' centre for care and nursing," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis. Both directors see the reason for the opening of the new neighbourhood office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change. This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future. In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasised at the inauguration ceremony, the neighbourhood office is also dedicated to combating loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite people to get together on a regular basis".

Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October Now it is official: After the date for the match between FC Eintracht Bamberg and the third-division team Würzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, 6 October has now been set as the date. FC Eintracht Bamberg's match in the round of 16 of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third league team FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally scheduled. The match will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 7 p.m. in Bamberg's Fuchsparkstadion. "We are glad that we now know when the match will take place, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out that tickets are now on sale. It is something special for our team to play against a third league team. We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlit games have a special charm. FC Eintracht Bamberg entered the round of the last 16 teams in 2010 by winning at the district league team 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league team 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2). The winner of the competition receives 5,000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Club Cup. The defending champions are third-division relegated SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at 92 Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead. He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday. With Mang, the Künstlerhaus has lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the statement said. Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War. Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and institute director. From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design. In the 1980s, he was commissioned to furnish the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking fine: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has attracted unpleasant attention in Bremen. Footballer once upon a time, Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged by Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler. According to his own statement, he has put on 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years. Intellectually, however, he has not gained any weight. Wiese was having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when he saw a parking attendant outside issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro. Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the fine due at her feet, as reported by the Bild newspaper. The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident. "The matter is still being investigated," says the city of Bremen. Only then will it be decided whether Wiese will be reported or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants The fertile soil and rainforest-like climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for marijuana plants to thrive. For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have been uprooting and burning the 4500 plants.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghan man Witnesses are being sought by the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at around 11.45 pm, three young men were walking from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster. According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and shouted to them that they should wait for him. At that time, the group was on the level of the bft petrol station. Three people were also on the premises of the petrol station. One of these men shouted at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist. The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose. When his two friends rushed over and tried to calm the thug down, he initially let go of his victim. The injured young man was then taken home by his friends. The perpetrator chased the group in a car to their home and demonstratively drove past there several times. When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette. There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person. With the help of a baton, they beat the victim's face and thighs. The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical treatment. So far only a vague description of the perpetrators is available. One of the men was about 1.80 metres tall. The second thug is said to have been about 1.65 metres tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt. Police are asking witnesses and informants to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests € 310000 Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen. The mayor of the joint municipality, Bernd Bormann, the economic development officer, Uta Seim-Schwartz, and Asendorf's mayor, Heinfried Kabbert, are also pleased. Many places in the countryside lack doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the Felstehausen practice there on 1 October. While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will support his successor with a half-time position for the next few months. After a renovation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, by which time he will have invested € 310000 in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6. It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and also wants to join the practice next year. "We always had it in the back of our minds that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr Ursel Felstehausen, laughing. "When the time came, I simply called them". The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future. "The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller. "We want to get to know the families over the years and accompany them". He also sees being his own boss soon as an advantage. And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice. They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen. This is also where Frank Müller, father of two, grew up. After his medical studies in Hanover, he worked in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg. He is currently a senior physician in Sulingen, was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and is a volunteer with the German Red Cross (DRK) emergency unit in Bruchhausen-Vilsen. From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss. While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialised in gastroenterology. The Müllers, both internists, want to set up as family doctors. "The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll. After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern. We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more consulting room. In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed. The Müllers will receive a subsidy totalling 50,000 euros from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the joint municipality (12,500 euros) and the community (12,500 euros). "This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continuing," emphasises joint municipality mayor Bernd Bormann. According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, compared to about 500 in the average practice in northern Germany. There is another GP practice in Asendorf. A positive side effect of Frank Müller taking over the practice: the pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen. If no successor had been found, it would have gone. By the way, anyone who visits Müller's surgery will continue to see familiar faces: the seven medical assistants and the cleaner have taken over from the Felstehausens. Their departure marks the end of an era in Asendorf; after all, the doctors practised there for 30 years. "In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls with a smile. She feels a little nostalgic after all this time. "But we still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist. Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6000-square-metre plot of land." "Until now, I have always shied away from gardening, but now that could change". In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and enjoys travelling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through" "Now border controls are also being ramped up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner. The controls at the Hungarian border will remain in place in parallel. It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "as a matter of course". The care and security of the people is in the foreground. However, it is also clear that "clear signals are needed", said the Minister. People must know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border. A controlled approach is needed. Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refuses The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to continue their journey towards Austria and Germany, and possibly also to set up corridors for the refugees. However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not quite see it that way. The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable"; Slovenia would rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary. The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area. As the minister emphasised, Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees. "Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," Györkös Znidar stressed. According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday in order to avoid registration. The Croatian police were able to intercept them in the nearby maize fields. According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, ever since. They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children. Rescue services and the Red Cross have also been deployed. In the coming days, his country expects about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic. In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were being diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday. The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was directing people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to," it said. According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses are expected to arrive in the course of the day. Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany The occupants had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away, through Serbia. "We heard that Hungary had closed, so the police told us to drive here," said one of the refugees. They wanted to travel on to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. This means that the Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which observers had already predicted, could now actually be shifted to a route a little further west. Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control" Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influx of refugees. He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive possibilities for border control". Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area. Slovenia has been a member of the Schengen area since 2007, and its EU partners have since given it a consistently good report card as far as the standard of border controls is concerned. On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence. According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke. According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed. It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees now want to continue their journey to the Croatian border. The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to calm the situation at a local inspection in Horgos on Wednesday morning: Now that the Hungarian border is closed, he said, the debate about alternative routes for refugees is premature. The number of refugees is not very high at the moment. It was not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country. Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started distributing maps to refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia. However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: in parts of the border area there are still uncleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war. On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of deminers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million Supranonok is alleged to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining access to as yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010. The information obtained was allegedly used for insider trading on the financial markets. In this way, according to investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars was scammed. "Today's settlement shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught," the SEC release said. Trials of 32 other defendants in the case were ongoing. Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia. The perpetrators are alleged to have operated both in the USA and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Help Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years There is a lot of activity around Mannheim's Paradeplatz. People are running their errands, sometimes quickly, sometimes strolling leisurely. They head for the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon on Paradeplatz. Light rail vehicles stop. Pulsating, bustling life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it all four large boards, each with the heading "Before I die I would like to".... With this campaign, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and was confronted with mixed reactions. "It's a matter of life, so we went into the city and among the people with this campaign," says Josefine Lammer. The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and conversations, as are the volunteers. While some passers-by spontaneously grab a chalk and add "affirm my life", "be able to read", "drive through the USA in a camper", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long" to the sentence, others stop for a moment, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then move on. Again and again, small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying. Peter Hübinger is also on site at the moment. "Only when I realise that the end will come for me at some point in this world can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid. Therefore, this high-profile campaign on the occasion of the 20th anniversary is good. However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all it is a very personal matter. According to Josefine Lammer's experience, the topic of death and dying is still taboo, even though the hospice movement has done a lot to open people's minds in recent years. Angelika Godefroid shares this view. The death and grief counsellor is one of the first volunteers. Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in assisted dying. When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was looking for volunteers, she immediately volunteered and was one of the founders in 1995. Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany those affected and their relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Saint Vincent Hospice. They are all carefully trained. Angelika Godefroid is well able to deal with her task and the experiences and adventures she has had in the process. "I see life from a different perspective, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says. The services offered by the outpatient ecumenical hospice service are free of charge and non-denominational. The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations make the training as well as further education and supervision of the dying and mourning companions possible. Training for new staff is offered every two years. The boards described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6). Further personal wishes can also be noted there on postcards.
Hoyerswerda: A little help for refugees More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days. Giving them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers. In Hoyerswerda, too, there are quite a few people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city. Petra and Klaus Heine are among them. Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul. Even at 74 years old, she still enjoys teaching. Every Thursday she does so at the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße. There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German. Of course, the lessons are very different from those at a real school.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall The Bernried municipal council approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall. And it made one exception. The roof may be flatter for the solar system. The plans for the long-awaited construction of the gymnasium at the Bernried sports ground are progressing step by step: In the recent meeting of the municipal council, the elaborated building application was unanimously approved without much discussion. Previously, the council had decided on an application for an "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan. The "exception" concerned permission for a special form of roof construction. Accordingly, a "saddle roof with a non-central ridge and roof overhang" is to be erected. The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south-facing roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting. The "exemption" was again about the roof pitch, which is to be less than ten degrees for energy reasons - in contrast to what is prescribed in the development plan. This significantly reduces the volume of the hall. An "exemption" was necessary because the development plan does not allow any "exceptions" with regard to the roof pitch - although the Bernried municipal council usually takes a rather restrictive approach to applications for exemptions. However, the construction of the gymnasium is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger. The construction of the gymnasium at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried. The costs are calculated at around 2.3 million euros. Subsidies are expected from school and mass sports funding. In the next procedural step, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the district administration office for review.
Peißenberg hospital moves to Schongau The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016. At the same time, Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at Schongau hospital. The ward as well as the majority of the staff will move from Peißenberg to Schongau with him. This is the surprising plan of the hospital GmbH of the district, which District Administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed. However, a decision on the move will be made by the supervisory board, which meets next Wednesday, 23 September. If the plans are implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed. The vast majority would move to Schongau with Fischer and the existing internal ward. The rooms are available. The employees who cannot move to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß said. The staff had been informed about the plans. The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been medical director of the Schongau clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. According to Jochner-Weiß, when it came to the question of who should succeed him, the name "Fischer" came up, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and move to Schongau with his team. For the hospital in Schongau, this would definitely mean an "upgrading" and a broadening of the range of services in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß. Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators. Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological diseases in the internal ward. On a transitional basis for the next two years, Fischer and his team are to manage both hospitals, if the supervisory board agrees, until the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed for good in Peißenberg next year after almost 140 years. Previously, the district had planned this for 2018, when the renovation currently underway at the Weilheim hospital will be completed. District Administrator Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Federal Miners' Insurance Association, is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future. "I rule that out". Jochner-Weiß could not say how the property would be used in the future, saying that there were several considerations. Currently, a short-term care facility run by Caritas and a day psychiatric clinic are housed there. "Nothing better could have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-relocation to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandingly" by the staff. There was no real perspective for the hospital, where Fischer has worked as head physician for over 30 years. He had been asked by colleagues in Schongau to take over the post of medical director. The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) has been threatened with closure time and again in the past decades, departments were closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged by Bergischer HC tonight (8.15 pm). The Bundesliga leaders are the clear favourites in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant. Last season, the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at the hands of the BHC, and they have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon. Several hunters were on duty during the harvesting of a maize field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), according to the police. After being shot, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals. It was initially unclear how exactly the accident could have happened. The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crime A suspect led police to the body of a 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday. During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenager and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen. A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime. The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the public prosecutor's office and the police announced on Wednesday. A 20-year-old man, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, is considered a suspect. He confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the place where the body was found. The 16-year-old girl had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed after visiting an autumn festival in Rockenhausen the previous evening. During the search for the young woman, investigators initially came across personal belongings of the victim. Interviews with friends and acquaintances of the missing woman finally led to a suspicion against the 20-year-old. The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found. According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted during police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal. The 20-year-old was to be brought before a magistrate on Wednesday; investigators are charging him with manslaughter. Further investigations are expected to shed light on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap The situation on the German housing market is tense. More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation. The pressure on the housing market is growing. Social housing is facing a challenge. The distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun. With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities. They are competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable flats. To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year until 2020. This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing" alliance of associations. By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year. This means that there is a shortage of 140,000 flats. Refugees are no longer obliged to live in initial reception accommodation as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay. Many then hit the housing market and join the long queues for rented flats. According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in rented accommodation last year. However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees. The study also identifies considerable failures in housing policy in recent years. Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing from year to year. Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains that there are currently about 770,000 housing units missing in the metropolitan areas. Many working people are therefore forced to live in shared flats in big cities. Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in "Hotel Mama" because of the slump in the housing market. In the big cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years. To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a new start. New incentives are to boost social housing construction. For example, the land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidised housing could be suspended for a limited period. In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary. The subsidy programme for refugee housing of the state bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities. A good week after its launch, more than half of the available 300 million euros - 184 million euros - had already been drawn down on Monday evening. Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor There is practically no way through to Hungary, so more and more refugees are choosing the route via Croatia. Zagreb has announced that it will grant free passage to the north via Slovenia. But the route is still dangerous. Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees. "I have spoken with the Slovenian interior minister, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic. Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone. The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country. After the Serbian-Hungarian border was sealed, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there. The Croatian television station RTL reports that 500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik. Hungary had closed its border to refugees the day before. Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous. Croatia wants to let the refugees pass. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "They can pass through and we are preparing for that possibility." These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something. However, he said, they are people who do not want to live in Croatia. Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at Serbia's border with EU neighbour Croatia in the morning. According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan. They arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as by taxi. Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot. At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not come across border fences. But the border strip holds other dangers: There are still live mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s. Mine-clearers are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage. Meanwhile, hardly any refugees are coming to Hungary after the border was closed. On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people apprehended. Shortly before the border closed on Monday, there had been 9380. The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence. In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated. Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country. According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new "transit zones" set up at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing point, Röszke. Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people. On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there. In practice, however, no one has any chance of being granted asylum in Hungary. According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country". The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there. Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke. In Röszke, workers started cleaning up. They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left at the roadside in the past weeks. Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt. No one wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction. Few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary. The country has also strengthened its border controls. Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, however, according to government figures. In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting to continue their journey to Germany. Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities. In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded people" across the border "We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases were standing at the entrance to the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler. Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau. But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau. Beforehand, we fed the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks. We said straight away that we would take them to Passau by car. "That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in an interview with OÖN. They were very grateful. One man did not miss the opportunity to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade. "That made us very happy," said Stadler. The stranded train passengers had changed from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau in Wels on Sunday evening to try to make it across the border after the announcement at short notice that rail traffic to Germany had been suspended. However, the regional train was parked before the border in Wernstein am Inn. In Wernstein, cross-border activities are generally very popular. The bridge festival on Sunday brought people together with their Bavarian neighbours in a sociable way, the day before a two-bridge run in a sporting way - organised by the Union Wernstein and Bavarians from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy: instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the Röszke camp that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has highly officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the vapour circle of National Socialism. Those who suffer from this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas. The refugees will also have to realise that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp. It will be a great challenge to establish humane conditions for those seeking protection in our country in view of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter. And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof accommodations Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation. Christian Konrad is used to his word carrying weight. The government has appointed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees. Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the Traiskirchen initial reception centre. "We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success. The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday had also taken place without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organisational "masterstroke". The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation". Konrad expects a total of 85,000 accommodations to be needed this year. In order to meet this number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states, 15,000 by the federal government. If there are more refugees, we can manage. "But it's not a bottomless pit," Konrad said. He has already held talks with the state governors. They had assured him that they would also create accommodation for the coming refugees. "Things are going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier. The former VP mandatary supports Konrad. Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help. The asylum coordinator also has high hopes for the ORF campaign "Help like us". On the platform, private persons can offer accommodation in an uncomplicated way. In addition, they hope to find hotels that are empty in winter. Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high". In times of need, they said, it was not acceptable that accommodation providers had to comply with a certain height of towel rails or size of skylights. For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply. Konrad justifies the fact that he, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, is more successful in providing accommodation with his experience. I am an older gentleman who is not easily told the untruth to his face. Persuasion is his most important weapon. Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic any money, as they themselves explained. They want to increase their staff to three or four. Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful. Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office. But there are apparently problems with the permit. For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Centre to accommodate refugees. This is not necessary at the moment because the people concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP). In case of an emergency, however, other locations are to be examined for their suitability. The city leader criticises the distribution of refugees within the province. Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed" In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the further procedure in the refugee issue. Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed. The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany would continue to be possible. However, there would now be the corresponding border controls. There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being. However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany on regular trains. Pühringer once again called on the other EU Member States to show greater solidarity in the refugee issue. For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a question of time The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in Linz's Industriezeile is officially completed. The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, the rest (2700 square metres) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector. "In IT, bright minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser. He could imagine investing in start-up companies at Neue Werft and acquiring some later on. Right from the start, S&T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours - which Niederhauser hopes will lead to something: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time. 1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S&T, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which is owned in equal parts by the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG). The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years. 30 per cent of the 2,700 square metres of remaining space in the building have already been let, and there are enquiries for a further 40 per cent.
Lia Peroni owner opens second shop in the arcade The new shop focuses on Furla handbags. Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog. The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this plan without further ado: after all, she has now got an addition in the form of another shop. In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from various manufacturers, among other things, everything now revolves around ladies' handbags from the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros. Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros. The new shop has been open since yesterday. Before that, the shop was rebuilt for several weeks. "I thought about opening another shop for a long time," says Breit. One of the deciding factors was that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also taken with the idea of having their own location where only their handbags are sold. "We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots. Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother. I like it most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices. Why so many women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag is something even the expert cannot answer with absolute certainty. Perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt Donald Trump's Palatinate ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called braggarts. Some people also associate this quality with the billionaire who wants to become US president. Donald Trump (69) is always good for a stir. Whether he makes xenophobic remarks, is rude to journalists or reveals gaps in his knowledge of international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency stirs up the election campaign. And he is doing well. This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from. The New Yorker with the blow-dried hairdo is known to many in the wine-growing village on the Wine Route. Some people in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him by more than a hundred and fifty degrees. His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode. Simone Wendel from Kallstadt made a film about Trump. And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world? "I think they find it kind of exciting, but in their Kallstadt way they are not that deeply impressed either," says Simone Wendel. The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the town and its famous offspring, which, in addition to Trump, include the Heinz ketchup family. Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - for example, by saying that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt. He did not make it to king of hearts there. While there is respect for the family's achievements, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is "a bit of a loudmouth", says Wendel. Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surrounding area is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the braggarts, she says. So Trump comes from the village of the braggarts. Trump's success story began in 1885, when his grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the USA. The cornerstone of the real estate business was the first land purchases in New York. But the grandparents' lives were not free of tragedy: their wish to return home permanently failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time. The director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, explained at the start of the film that Trump had not been accepted because he had once left without permission. Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant". This contrasts with the sometimes pithy statements of the descendant. He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants. "The way he rumbles is not so likeable," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was born Trump, grandpa was born Heinz"). The retired winemaker takes a rather distant view of the American, "he is always so quick-tempered". Does he think Trump will ever come? "I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old. "He has never cared about Kallstadt". The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like many a Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received. "I can't imagine the Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old. She would prefer him not to win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's a good thing". If those who were in charge in the USA at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have got there at all". "There are more interesting subjects than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler. And as president? "After all, it's not my president," she says. And: "The grapes will ripen even without President Trump". Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed at length, has been seen by 12,000 cinema-goers, and interest is also awakening in the USA.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village". On Wednesday, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, presented the award for gentle tourism to the village of 1,800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park. There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria. In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the distinction. A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants. At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
The Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees. At the beginning of the FW autumn retreat in Großwallstadt, party and parliamentary group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools if there were not a corresponding number of new teachers for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger. "Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system." The state parliamentary group of the Free Voters is meeting in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday. Actually, completely different main topics were planned. But the record number of refugees is now also dominating the Free Voters meeting. "Of course, the topic of asylum will overshadow the retreat," said Aiwanger. Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s. "We can't go on like this, we have to get to the root causes," said the Free Voters leader. The Free Voters want to deport rejected asylum seekers as soon as possible. That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum appeals: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger. The FW leader criticised several federal states for not being consistent: "We would need uniform standards among the federal states nationwide." "Bavaria deports, others don't," he said. "We have to become more capable of acting there." But state policy is not to be swept under the table in Großwallstadt. A perennial issue that has been on the agenda for years remains: education policy. For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot project "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the grammar school middle school from three to four years is being tested - as a result, it will take nine years to reach the Abitur. But this does not go far enough for Aiwanger. "The issue of G9 must be accelerated," said the FW leader. We demand freedom of choice for all grammar schools that want it. Free passage for G9 everywhere it is wanted.
Firmer Wall Street helps Dax get going The German stock market closed with gains after long stretches of directionless and nervous trading. Only in the afternoon did a firmer start on the US stock exchanges provide a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 per cent to 10 188.13 points. The MDax mid-cap index gained 0.54 per cent to 19 552.88 points. The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 per cent to 1736.69 points. The EuroStoxx 50, the leading index of the Eurozone, advanced by 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points. The trading centres in London and Paris also recorded solid gains. In the USA, the Dow Jones index was up about 1 per cent. Many stockbrokers expect the markets to tread water until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also until the big drop on the futures exchanges this Friday. The discussion about the burdens from the nuclear phase-out has temporarily pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left deep marks on Eon. According to "Spiegel", the German energy companies may be short 30 billion euros in provisions. The federal government denied the figures mentioned in the press. The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 per cent (RWE) and 6.15 per cent (Eon). Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 per cent at the top of the Dax. According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend had an impact. According to the report, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chip manufacturer. The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off. Car stocks were in demand: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt. The shares of carmakers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.34 per cent and 2.21 per cent respectively. Volkswagen shares rose by 1.26 per cent. On the German bond market, the current yield of listed German government securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) per cent. The Rex bond index rose 0.12 per cent to 139.55 points. The Bund future lost 0.71 per cent to 154.11 points. The euro exchange rate fell in the afternoon to 1.1262 dollars at last count. Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars. The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
Building area planned in the city The plot of land near Emden's Alte Post youth centre is to be built on again. The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre area. A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet. Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of land of about 4000 square metres in the direct vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre. Preparations for this are currently underway. The plan is to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing. The city is waiting for corresponding offers. It is not yet clear which investor will be considered. Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded yet. The city of Emden had already bought part of the property on the corner of Ringstraße and Große Straße a few months ago and had the building demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the Table The plans for the holiday home development at Kleines Meer near Emden are taking shape. The investor presented plans for the project to the public for the first time. Some residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat. For months, behind closed doors, negotiations, discussions, debates and drawings took place. Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kleine Meer near Emden are on the table. The interested party, the medium-sized Emden-based company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the Emden council's urban development committee. Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda. Under pressure from project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends from the System-Bau management went on the offensive: "We don't have answers to all questions yet," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors. But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now. The project, costing around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months. The pictures and new details about the desired hotel building provoked strong reactions among Meerbuden owners who had come to the meeting. Roberto Schulz, owner of the Meerbuden and member of the board of Pro Hieve, a group representing the interests of the residents, complains: "It will be a huge block that towers over all the other buildings. Like many other project critics, he also fears that the planned size of the complex will lead to an increase in traffic: "There will have to be busloads of people to make it worthwhile," says Schulz. There is still no operator. "First we have to have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends. Because this is still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twins - the offspring of gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to announce the arrival of twins among its gorillas. The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday. Twin births are rare among gorillas. The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago, in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo. The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as mother Dian has been holding them close to her body. First the "Bild" had reported.
Love story set in the Hunsrück It is a theme that is currently attracting more attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unattractive in her school days, meets the crush of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her. This is also the case in the recently published novel "Eigentlich sind wir nicht so" by Luisa Binder. Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding villages. The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged A 33-year-old car driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision on the cross-street between Nordring and Auf Herdenen. A 60-year-old lorry driver was driving on the cross-span in the direction of the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout. As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta parked in front of it. According to the police, the vehicles involved in the accident suffered property damage of about 10,000 euros. The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer roadworthy and had to be towed away.
Drunks disrupted the event As the security staff could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police. Only with the use of pepper spray were the officers able to take the troublemakers into custody. A breath alcohol test showed a 16-year-old to be 0.89 per mill. The adolescent was picked up by his mother. A 28-year-old man had a blood alcohol level of 2.15 per mille and remained in custody for the time being.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab rips apart A truck driver was seriously injured in a rear-end collision involving three trucks on the A5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening. Two of the three trucks involved had braked in the direction of Basel in front of a permanent construction site. The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, according to the police. The cab of the driver who caused the accident was completely torn apart. The driver was seriously injured and taken to hospital. The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 am. The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
More and more refugees are being apprehended away from the large checkpoints at the German-Austrian border. Many smugglers increasingly let people out at smaller border crossings on the Austrian side for fear of being discovered and arrested, said a spokesman for the Federal Police. Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been apprehended in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday. They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and weirs. There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration. According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week. By 8.00 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesperson said in the morning. After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest Meteorologists warn of squalls in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon. Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced. The powerful depression is the offshoot of tropical storm "Henry", which has been moving across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands over the past few days. Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden. According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour are expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning. On Friday, the sun will shine for a longer time.
It's the mass that counts: Every two years, carmakers present their new products at the IAA. In 2015, there is a lot of movement in the compact car segment, which is currently selling particularly well. Cars from the compact class are currently in particularly high demand: according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment in August alone. This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September). Amidst all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year. One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in dealerships in autumn. "The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the show. It belongs to the core of the brand. To ensure that the volume model sells well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive. Opel is looking at a starting price below that of its biggest competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros. The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros. The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp. In addition, the Hessians offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time. Unlike its most important competitors, the VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model. A second version, the estate, will follow in spring and can already be seen at the IAA. And what other new compact cars will be presented at the IAA besides the Astra? Renault Mégane: Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competitor, the Mégane. At the show, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door model in a conventional and a decidedly sporty GT version. It will go on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as an estate. Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment. With this new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment. With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fits in perfectly with the brand's design line. The base model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp. However, a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also on offer. Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt. The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp. According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm). The Baleno will go on sale in Europe in spring 2016. DS 4: The compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA, is not entirely new, but has been completely revamped. On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot mainly worked on the front: The radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology. In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and Apple CarPlay integrated for the first time. In addition, there are a number of revisions and new variants in the compact class at the IAA, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square metres of cell are inhumane The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favour of an ex-inmate of Tegel Prison who had been housed for months in a cell that was too small. Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small. This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a ruling published on Wednesday. According to the judges, those affected can even hope to receive money if they were only locked up in the too small rooms for a few days (Ref.: 1 BvR 1127/14). Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: Between June and November 2009, he was housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel correctional institution; the toilet was not spatially separated. Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now at liberty again, was moved to a larger cell. His official liability suit against the state of Berlin because of the undignified detention conditions failed. However, the constitutional judges overturned the decision of the Berlin Court of Appeal and sent the case back for reconsideration. They consider the man's human dignity to have been violated. Kammergericht now decides on the amount of compensation Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question are decisive for the compensation, a claim for compensation is given, they said. Otherwise, "a withering of the legal protection of personality would have to be feared". The Kammergericht must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation. The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past. Only in April, for example, they awarded damages to a prisoner because he was locked naked in a cell. According to a 2011 decision, multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane. On Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the decision of the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had found a prisoner to be inhumanly housed. The plaintiff at the time was housed in a cell similar to the one in the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months. Berlin's prisons have been in the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff. As a result, prisoners are repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, aggression increases, even fights are said to have occurred due to the tense situation. According to information from the judicial press office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled due to a lack of junior staff, and 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it" The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to take it on. What is in store for Germany? According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year; according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even capable of taking in one million refugees. Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we will". The following overview gives an idea of what lies ahead for Germany. According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) dwellings will be needed annually - for the next five years. That is almost twice as much as has been built so far (250000 flats). The shortage of housing, however, is particularly dramatic in the case of affordable rental properties: Every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of rent control, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap flats. Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros. In the view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be built annually, and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year. The scientists and the Federal Minister of Building and Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction. According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that in the long term 55 percent of refugees in Germany will be able to find employment. However, refugees in Germany are not even systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation. However, the decisive factor for the integration of refugees is whether they find work in Germany. Work is the key to social contacts, to esteem in the host society, but also to the immigrants' self-esteem, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt. According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from a ban on work for refugees to recognition of work. While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to one place of residence. In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view has prevailed that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market. A major hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of German language skills. So far, there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and job-related language courses. Studies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contacts. Thränhardt therefore believes that building networks is the royal road to labour integration. The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in daycare centres, an estimated ten to 15 per cent: "For uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration. Nevertheless, to convince the family of the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handouts in different languages. Should the need for kindergarten teachers increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by admitting more technical schools. In the Länder, pupils without German language skills are prepared for teaching in welcome classes. However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but also, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language. There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration. The German Student Union estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees want to study in Germany. In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated persons from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance. Access to higher education could be made easier for refugees who want to study. Refugees with a residence permit or toleration status no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act when they start studying. The latter generally do not receive Bafög, as they do not fall under the group of persons entitled to Bafög. Until now, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög; from 1 January 2016, this period will be reduced to 15 months. However, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union also demand that this funding gap be closed. Students should receive Bafög immediately. Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity. The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship. It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that would professionally take care of the newcomers. Rights also include duties. For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant it certain possibilities of control. This also includes the willingness to take firm action against religious fundamentalism. The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany. Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "immediately forfeited their right to reside here, in Germany", he said on Bavarian Radio. He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic. In the future, integration will be much more of an issue for society as a whole than it is today. This means that the majority society will also have to change, and the dismantling of discrimination and racism will become more urgent. Germany has - as a result of European decisions - had an anti-discrimination office and a General Equality Act for almost a decade. But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive. Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time, and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do, must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the good of all. In general, Germany is capable of providing medical care for the refugees expected so far, says the President of the German Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery. "In terms of manpower and capacity, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel. However, additional money would have to flow into the system. In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that health cards be handed out to all new arrivals immediately upon registration. Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states. And in the long run, it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided by the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act. Apart from that, the language barriers are a major problem for the doctors. The health scientist Thea Borde from Berlin has already shown that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients. She demands that interpreter costs be covered not only in clinics but also in doctors' offices. However, many refugees would be helped by more general medical contact points in emergency departments. And with a different diagnostic view. Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people, HIV education is important. However, Montgomery believes that German doctors can cope with the sometimes different clinical pictures due to their training. "Parasite infestations or tuberculosis are not that difficult to recognise. And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even alleviate the situation. Syrians have a highly developed education system, and many refugees are even doctors. In order to be allowed to practise, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further exams. According to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK. A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatised. Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, racing heart and fear of death. Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe jumpiness and emotional numbness. To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained. So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy. Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy at the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months. Moreover, in the social welfare offices, it is mostly case workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not. This often leads to misjudgements, says Munz.
With its new production "Passion", Circus Probst draws on the traditions of the circus arts. The aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment. Now Circus Probst invites you to dream in the ring on the Ziegelwasen. "Our passion is the circus." "I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior boss. "Passion" - this is the motto of the current ring production. The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years. So the gift to inspire is in the family's blood. "It is important to us to take people away from their everyday routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours," emphasises the 27-year-old junior manager. "Ring cocktail with cosmopolitan flair" is how director Reinhard Probst calls his concept. 50 cities on the almost 3 000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair. The circus programme is impressive with talented artists from all over the world. Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm. The Castillo Brothers also know their craft. The Cuban duo easily rivals the heroes of silent movies. Lightness and agility - these are the words they identify with. Their humorous art on the pole is meant to take women's hearts by storm. Apart from numerous bursts of laughter, the acrobatics of Circus Probst also fascinate with dexterity and agility. Balancing on a ball with a unicycle? No problem for He Yuan. Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time. Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with her agility. 60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect. "The animals belong to our family," emphasises Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst. Abuses in the keeping of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations. Stephanie Probst also takes a stand on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either". Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke. As far as possible, every wish is read from the eyes of the "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called. We want to work with the animals and have fun with them. If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to go into the ring. So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals. The Probst family is especially proud of their zebroid Jumbo, a cross between a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare. The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened. "But then, all of a sudden, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst says. The zebroid is not yet ready for the ring, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst. So there should be something for every visitor. "One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter if there are five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and put our hearts into it." Circus Probst invites you to its performances daily at 5 and 8 pm from 17 to 20 September. On Sunday, the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm. Thursday is family day, with reduced prices for the 5 pm performance. In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Refugees arrive in Weimar At noon on Tuesday, 49 people arrive at the municipal administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight. The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia. The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfil a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang. The rude awakening came on the rain-soaked motorway. At a company in the district of Gotha, one can fulfil one's dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp. This is what a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha did. On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over and done with. The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, skidded on the wet road and crashed into the crash barrier. The sports car was totalled and no one was injured. The damage to property is estimated at 40,000 EUR.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015 FC Bayern was apparently on the verge of signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago. Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breathtaking. In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar. But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already on the verge of leaving Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship. "I was told that Barça wanted to sell me," he said. "Madrid won everything back then, we won nothing," he recounts. And FC Bayern also registered that. Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern." "Rummenigge wanted me." As a reminder: Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern in the summer of 2008. Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not switch The switch, however, did not come about. And the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola. Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship." "Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me." "With that, he got me." Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi. Xavi was on the pitch for the entire distance for Barca against Bayern in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, knocking out the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and celebrating the royal class triumph at the end.
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse. Its arrival was expected for Wednesday night. The people arriving in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening. It expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive. Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this eventuality in recent days. Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there. They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities. In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the regional council in Gießen, which is responsible for the initial reception. Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria a possibility. "I believe that the decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said. He accused the European states of "collectively looking the other way". Four years ago, he said, they were glad that the chalice of military involvement had passed Germany by. "Now the conflict is landing crashingly on our doorstep," he told Deutschlandfunk radio. The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders. Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one would be sent back to Hungary even now. She said Germany had not sent any refugees back to Austria either. "No, that is the agreement," she explained. On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks on the matter between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany. She did not give concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin. In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route. Their destination is mostly Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week. Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday. The EU states have so far been unable to agree on a joint approach to the crisis. At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees. In view of the large influx of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to provide more support to the Länder in the initial reception and distribution of people. The federal government will manage this together with the Länder, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the state premiers in the Chancellery in Berlin. Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would receive it. However, those who do not have a chance to stay cannot stay in Germany. This view was emphatically shared in the discussion. The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now make a "huge effort". Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route. Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night. A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal off the border with Romania with a fence. Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU. Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from finding alternative routes via Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fence. The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan. There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence. Meanwhile, in Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus A global ocean is sloshing under the ice shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus. This is what researchers conclude from observations made by the Cassini space probe. According to these observations, the moon wobbles slightly on its orbit around the ringed planet. This wobbling motion is only small, but nevertheless too large for a continuously solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (New York State) on Tuesday. The researchers present their analyses in the scientific journal "Icarus". It has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus. Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006, which spew water vapour and ice particles and feed Saturn's so-called E ring. At least at the south pole there must be a subterranean sea, the astronomers concluded at the time. However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama will miss 1860 Munich for several weeks 1860 Munich will have to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month. An examination revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club announced. Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week. According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of compulsory rest". "This hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss," he said. "Of course we have to think about it now," sporting director Necat Aygün told the Bild newspaper with regard to the possible signing of a club-less professional. However, the Sechziger first presented a defensive man as a training guest. The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was also previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg. The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability". Goal scorer Rubin Okotie will be able to return to team training next week after suffering a concussion. The Austrian international is expected to start training as early as Thursday. Okotie injured his head in a violent collision during the game against Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3). Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
Not a diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet. However, if you want to watch your weight, you are often advised not to eat them. This is because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose. Nevertheless, these exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamins. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene. Eating these fruits supports vision, the immune system and metabolic processes in the body. When buying mangoes, they should not be too soft or too firm and should smell pleasant. The skin colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty. They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days. Then, of course, they taste great pure or in sweet dishes. But a mango also adds a special note to savoury dishes. It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radicchio. And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the USA. The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday. Drivers in particular are being sought. Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 temporary workers. In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking precautions earlier since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business. In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a foehn storm, then a striking cold front The foehn will break through in the valleys on the northern side of the Alps next night, Meteoschweiz reported on Tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday night, the foehn will blow through the foehn valleys, sometimes with gale force winds. After the föhn ends on Thursday morning, a prominent cold front will pass over us, bringing heavy rain, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature. As MeteoNews writes in a press release, Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong south-westerly flow. On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn will break through the valleys in the night to Wednesday. As a result, the Föhn will blow in the Föhn valleys until Thursday morning with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, in some places and especially in the Urnerland with gusts of over 100 km/h. The foehn may reach the neighbouring midlands in places, and gale-force winds of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains. While stormy foehn winds will bring summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees Celsius in the north on Wednesday, moisture will begin to accumulate on the southern slopes of the Alps. Rain will start here and continue until Thursday evening. In total, more than 100 litres of rain per square metre can be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days. On Thursday morning, the Föhn will run out of air and a cold front with heavy, partly thundery rain will roll across Switzerland from west to east. Together with the cold front, the wind will pick up strongly to stormy and temperatures will drop significantly. The following days will be autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer with up to 25 degrees at the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square Almost 500 years after the Reformation, Rome now has a Martin Luther Square. In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on Oppio Hill was christened with the name of the German reformer on Wednesday. In the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honoured as the "German Theologian of the Reformation". The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum. The naming was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome. Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protestants in the city of the popes had often only been able to live their faith as a minority in secret. The square symbolically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome. Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11. At the time, he found the city to be a degenerate hotbed of sin. According to historians, his negative impressions probably encouraged him in his later fight against Rome. With his theses against the sale of indulgences, Luther had then initiated the division of the occidental church.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible. Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts. In the beginning was the word? No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures. In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs. The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with bright colours and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures. On the contrary: adapted to the respective themes, they can certainly appear quite sombre. Otmar Alt worked for about three years on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the "book of all books". The result is cycles dedicated to themes such as the Way of the Cross, the Plagues, the Commandments or the Lord's Prayer. With these, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books. And above all, there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting. He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today, into current contexts. These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting. They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation. The decorative cover has golden letters. In this way, the 75-year-old doubly allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions. That is a high degree of intimacy. Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project in the first place: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter order. "There, education was sometimes done with the cane," Otmar Alt remembers. "I tried to come to terms with that in order to perhaps also get along with my father again". His second concern is to help art regain its status in these fast-moving times: "The perception of visual worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud. Symbolism is suppressed. Artists have a different desire and delight in showing things. Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative. "In this respect I am a dinosaur". Otmar Alt wants viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, to let them have an effect on them, to discover and feel what power they have: "The picture looks for its counterpart". At the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation on Tuesday, Klaus Altepost confessed that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he understands life with his pictures". Alt, he said, did not aim to capture the Bible in its entirety, but chose the themes that were important to him, even those that were mysterious. "This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "Here it is about the pictures, the text only explains. The result is a picture Bible. For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen one's life and find freedom". For Möhler, Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility. Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track nears Plans were made, space found, companies commissioned, mounds of earth modelled for a circuit: One year later, almost everything was ready - but even before the official opening of the BMX track, it was already over. Omissions in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the track. So the hill was removed and a new site was found - now with formal planning and an application for building permission. The approval will be received in October, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, first councillor, was now able to tell the children and youth committee. "I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said. Work on the former indoor swimming pool should then begin without "another pause for remembrance".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga sent a clear signal at the weekend. Football is reacting to the worsening situation in Germany and assures politicians of its help in dealing with the problems ahead. "I think this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification." "In principle, no one can say that this is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it." "This has to be everyone's concern, to get a grip on this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach. He plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September. "I'll be at the Chancellery next Wednesday to meet Minister of State Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor." "The topic will certainly play a central role there," he announced. Football can and wants to help. But the decisive course must be set by politics. The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years. "Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," explained Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta. Some Bundesliga clubs also support this programme. Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes). "We also want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and however they can," Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler told the Bild newspaper (Tuesday), calling the plan a "matter of course". "The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one should look away." "We Bundesliga footballers can, no, we must use our charisma, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said. Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign from the league". The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for this Friday's European Championship qualifier against Hungary. Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a great joint effort by German football". The fact that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their localities is great, he said. It is just as great that small and very small clubs are active. The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is being lived out in football. "That is of enormous importance," he said. This year and next, the federation, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will provide 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees. "The clubs have also already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses eye in accident According to several reports, the CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye in a fall at the beginning of July. In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the US, he fell on a glass of water he was carrying in his left hand after midnight, Wirtschaftswoche reported on Wednesday. "He almost bled to death, fainted, then dragged himself out into the street - that's what he told us last week," "WiWo" quoted SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner as saying. McDermott, however, could go about his work. "We will meet in Walldorf at the beginning of October before the supervisory board meeting," Plattner said. The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work", he said. McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group. "I am fully there for SAP, fully in my job," he said. "Of course, I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner the whole time," McDermott told the "SZ". McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but he has not been back to SAP's German headquarters in Walldorf since the summer. It was important for him to go public with such a personal story, the manager told the "SZ": "Something like this can happen to anyone." "The important thing is to get up again when you have fallen down."
McLaren substitute driver Magnussen out of action ... Magnussen tweeted a photo to that effect, explaining that he suffered the injury when he fell off his bike. He is therefore just as unlikely to be a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at this weekend's night race in Singapore as he will be a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal For Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of Marco Reus making a comeback in the first Europa League group match have finally been dashed. The international will also be absent from the Bundesliga leaders' clash with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky). "Unfortunately, we cannot fall back on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday. The BVB coach left open whether Reus will be back in Sunday's Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen: "We expect him to return to training on Friday." In view of the high workload of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his starting eleven in the Reus position. He announced a change in the goalkeeper position. Therefore, Roman Weidenfeller will take the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki. "He trains at an absolute top level," the football coach praised the world champion. However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League matches in the future. It is highly likely that he will also play in the second game. The brash statement by teammate Reus that reaching the final must be BVB's goal in the Europa League is understandable, according to midfielder Julian Weigl: "Marco is not so wrong about that." "I think we have a good chance of picking up the title."
Robot cars: government wants Germany to lead the way Germany wants to be the technological pioneer in the transformation of the car. On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet approved a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure. On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" on the sidelines of the IAA motor show. Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure fewer traffic jams, Dobrindt said. He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting with industry representatives at the IAA. The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio. To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on motorway 9 in Bavaria. In order to "avoid imposing additional liability risks on drivers", the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments". For example, Germany wants to lobby internationally for the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour. The German government also wants to advocate for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for humans as drivers. In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, and the driver is becoming more and more of a passenger. The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the surroundings and process the data in seconds. According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020. Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not to be expected until well after 2020". The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros in 2025. "The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol. However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified. Germans, however, are still sceptical about self-driving cars - much more so than the French or Americans. A survey presented at the AA on Wednesday by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will become established in the next ten years, 32 percent only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all. In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous driving cars by 2025, in the USA 33 percent. In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle. According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads. On the motorway, 15 percent could imagine this in moving traffic, and 45 percent in traffic jams. A good one in four would not give up control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and doubles start at European Table Tennis Championships According to the current status, the player from Düsseldorf only wants to compete in the singles at the championships from 25 September to 4 October. The final decision will be made on 22 September at the latest. "This is a huge loss for our team," he said. "The boys found out in the morning". "But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships training in Düsseldorf. At that time, Boll was on a flight to a long-term sponsor appointment in China. The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday. "Without Timo it is a disadvantage, we are not such a clear favourite now," said European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov. However, the Hamelin native, who heads the seedings list in Ekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat. "Timo was also missing then, and we became European champions." "We should orientate ourselves on that," the world number five explained.
English international footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg. During the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle from Héctor Moreno and was substituted after lengthy treatment. The first diagnosis of Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old teammate indicated a fractured tibia.
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible It's a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax figure cabinet of horrors: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday. The highlights: Mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections. They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star on the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things - and by putting men in skirts. "I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair." "It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said. For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which can be seen at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung from 18 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about himself. Actually, he had been against it because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said. When you die, you go to the museum. The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris. "It's about so much more than beautiful clothes," said Kunsthalle director Roger Diederen. It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society, he said. The exhibits provide an insight into the almost unmanageable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship. The show is not structured chronologically, but it is an excellently choreographed gesamtkunstwerk for which a lot of effort was put in: For example, a stylist was hired to do the dolls' hair. According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers transported 14 tonnes of material to Munich. Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a lederhosen outfit with a corset. Heidi meets Madonna. He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different, Gaultier said. Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition. It represents the designer's first, tentative attempts at fashion. As a child (he was not a good student and was bad at football) he used to dress his teddy in bras and dresses, Gaultier said. His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll. Later, he taught himself how to design fashion. He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told us in Munich. Later, of course, I bought them. He was unable to pay the models for his first fashion show. They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were all about making metres. The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example. That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen. Instead, fashion is important again. In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a bigger role, was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche. Reinhardt cites a few examples: Lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes. In general, so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, is an increasing order potential. Anyone in the textile industry in Germany who does not serve niches is no longer on the market. In our country, they already account for half of all orders. Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauen Lace and Embroidery Industry Association. Only they are allowed to carry the protected label. In the last 15 years, about 80 per cent of sales have been lost. Private specialist shops and wholesalers are almost non-existent. Our products hardly reach the customer in this way any more. Nowadays, mass-produced goods are made much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains. In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA. Enough reasons, therefore, for new approaches. The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have a quality seal that shows that our production is ecologically and socially compatible. Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used". Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace. To counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products. That takes time and courage. There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically above all," says Schmidt. That is why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base. A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace. In the process, the machine embroiders small balls in some places. Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace". Now she uses snowball lace for her jewellery. In an elaborate process, she embosses the pattern in silver. "Many people in the region identify with Plauen lace - young and old," says Reuter. She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memento. So I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of Plauen lace.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" film You're not supposed to touch legends, but Disney is daring to make a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins" anyway. According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a new film, but a kind of sequel that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny. It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England. Who will play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear. But the director has already been confirmed: Rob Marshall, last in the cinema with "Into the Woods".
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predatory fish and thus impose a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent on consumers. The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and small children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch. According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons". However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that about 50 per cent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the limits still in force. After doubling the limits, only 14.5 per cent would then be unsaleable. In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch. Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick" because smaller peaceful fish, such as carp, are usually so low in contamination that they already comply with the planned maximum values. The reduction for small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary tactic that only helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained. Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates in the food chain, especially in predatory fish. The Federal Government therefore warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children". However, the Federal Environment Ministry states on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum levels that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected. Mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion. German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to written information provided by the Federal Environment Ministry to Annalena Baerbock, a member of the Green Party in the Bundestag. The concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube rivers, for example, is "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the magazine "Der Spiegel" had quoted from the paper in March. Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
