The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo. India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May, meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties. Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic ties with the world's third largest economy. Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda. India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speeding motorbike A motorbike was seized after the rider drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape Bilbara police. Traffic police officers in Karratha attempted to stop a blue motorbike this morning after observing it leaving a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h. Police report that the rider then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before turning into bushland, where officers lost sight of it. The motorbike, as well as a person matching the driver's description, were later seen at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgarra. Karratha Police charged a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop signal as well as reckless driving. He is scheduled to appear in the Karratha Magistrate's Court on 23 September. The motorbike was seized and impounded for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels. George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the High Court in Glasgow. He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013. The charge is that Webster assaulted her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent." Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014. Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish union organising as a civil right. "As unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. That's why I proudly introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis. This landmark law gives workers the same legal recourse for union organising discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks. Adding to the National Labour Law to provide a way for workers facing discrimination to organise union representation, to sue for justice in civil court - and to obtain damages or punitive damages - is a sensible and necessary initiative. But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards. In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea. Despite the setbacks unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and uphold labour rights. There was a time, millions of Americans still remember, when this country named democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in the same breath. When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that Hedki Tojo's militarised autocracy would be replaced by democracy. Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role in creating a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognised that "the rights of workers to associate and bargain and act together are guaranteed." When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy. Recognising that workers would have to organise and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations for the purpose of securing and improving working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade. Agreements which restrict or are intended to diminish this right are null and void; measures intended to do so are unlawful. When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and the other drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of his interests." For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights. As this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and for that union to then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - must be protected. With these rights under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to revisit the American ideal that working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society. As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago, "History is a great teacher. Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not limit the strength of the nation, it increased it. By raising the standard of living of millions, labour has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production. Those who attack labour forget these simple truths, but history preserves them. History remembers, and so should we. The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections as safeguards against discrimination in the creation of worker representation - is long overdue. Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all Louisiana abortion clinics to close A US federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted implementation of a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state. The measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and is set to take effect on 1 Sept, would force doctors who perform abortions to obtain a patient admitting privilege at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice. The judge's ruling, however, means that for now, doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while seeking such a right. "Plaintiffs may continue to practice in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling. A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to issue a more permanent ruling for the law. Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to win hospitalization rights. "Today's decision means that Louisiana women will escape an insidious law that seeks to take away their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairwoman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law. It was not immediately clear whether the ruling extended to doctors from the two clinics that had not joined the suit and also sought admitting privileges. Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi. Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday. Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that admitting privileges require unnecessary restrictions on doctors. Abortion opponents counter that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics. Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient admitting privileges, the Centre for Reproductive Rights announced. If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor would no longer perform the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said. In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana state representatives said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient referral rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas. Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute online for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007. Women in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in urban areas. Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 per cent were still alive five years after diagnosis. Research leader Susan Jordan, from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that for those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas. SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer The researchers looked at the women's medical care over seven years. Dr Jordan said a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing conditions and social and economic status also affected survival rates. Survival rates were lowest for older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis. For those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas. Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this. "This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said. Despite the improvement in telemedicine services to counteract the distances, she suggested an increase in the service of flown-in doctors as a possible remedy to allow specialists to provide care to women closer to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region. Dr Jordan said the study found poor long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer, regardless of geographic status, and underscored the need for better treatment and screening strategies. The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia. In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres lament falling homeownership rates The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under 35, could see garden centres lose tens of thousands of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products", according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times. The report said renters spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that people who own their own home spend on their garden. The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular practice of tarmacking front gardens for parking purposes and declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to generate £5 billion a year in sales. Greater London, where over a 6-year period the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent, reports the lowest spend on garden products per household. The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living in rented accommodation or having small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants. Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser for the RHS said, "Container gardening, for example, is popular with renters because they can take their plants with them when they move." The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail gardening due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. He also predicted an improved market situation this year due to better weather after inclement weather in March and April last year.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior US diplomat for information on a report on American and British spying in Turkey. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the chargé d'affaires of the US embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday. German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as online magazine The Intercept, reported that the information obtained by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence agencies. According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report, saying that all major countries spied on each other. An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence agency was also targeting Ankara prompted much angrier reactions from the Turkish government.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption Prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and Calvià town employees to the Mallorca public prosecutor's office on Friday. The head of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge-drinking hotspot of Magaluf. Chief Superintendent José Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody after corruption allegations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located. According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the town of Calvià to the office of Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday. Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro. The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners testified that the authorities' nepotism was having a serious impact on their businesses. "It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court. Leave our livelihoods out of it. We have nothing to lose. Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a booze cruise. The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of drunken holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub crawls. The Playhouse club where the fellatiovor incident took place has been forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub crawl organiser Carnage are jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000). The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for quite a few drunken accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
First day of spring with wet and blustery weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport. Another 5mm of rain fell on the city by 9pm this evening, following 6.6mm that had already fallen on Sunday night. The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, blustery showers, including a downpour that began just before 8pm and provided almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes. After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8°C. The gusty weather conditions likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide. The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30pm, but was hit by a wind shear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off through. Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time. Flight data showed that the aircraft also had to go through on a second approach and eventually touched down at about 8.40pm. The flight delay subsequently delayed several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney. A high temperature of 16°C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Israeli children return to schools after Gaza war Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters while rocket and mortar fire rained down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, keeping Gaza schools closed while the territory recovered from the fighting. The start of school brought a sense of joy and anticipation to communities in southern Israel that were scarred by rocket shell holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh. In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from walls and sliding walls before students arrived. "We are a little scared but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there. Many children from our area desperately need a return to a routine. Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit strange" to suddenly go back to school. "Those were difficult times and we didn't leave the house at all," she said. President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support. Until a ceasefire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire. Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return. The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned. Their children have been placed in other schools for the time being. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that has been badly hit by Palestinian shelling. He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure you acquire knowledge and offer you security." Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday. The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; however, major issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports. Israel is demanding Hamas disarm and hand over the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting. A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month. More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to Palestinian and UN estimates. Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were combatants, but provided no concrete evidence to support this information. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed. Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli towns during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country. Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other strikes. The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters. While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year. "I hope school will be open again soon so we can continue learning like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a Gaza City school.
House prices have seen the sharpest winter rise in seven years, a widely watched index shows. The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, RP data showed on Monday. The increase puts the total increase in June, July and August at 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007. The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country. RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne were driving a two-tier market. RP Data's figures show that Sydney house prices increased by 16.1 per cent last year, compared to 11.7 per cent in Melbourne. The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent respectively. At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year. Mr Lawless went on to say that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale for the next few months, which would give the market "a real test". "Considering the continued high rate of auction prices, a generally fast rate of sales and the continued low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: "My father never gave me a hug. Never said "I love you" Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958. His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited. Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father, which originated from the show on Radio 4. The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies. But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments. He attended "a lot" of therapy after his mother died, and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father. It was hard to know him. You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise. Leave your sister alone. Move it! I want to watch cricket. My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a kid - would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket shot. I never had a conversation like that with him. For much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner reading the paper. Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than they were in his father's day, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him. It's a bit brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot. My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly start to sing because he could wash the foundry off him. As I walked around there, I realised that he had been doing that for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him grew. Still, Henry grew up as a child without expressions of love from his parents. My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you". It was only when my mother was unwell towards the end of her life that we started saying "I love you, I love you, I love you". Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child. Could you stop with the "I love you"? Why don't you stop hugging me? Dad, I'm 22! with Dawn French. Why shouldn't we be friends? She's a great mum. Still friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years. Dawn is a good person. Why shouldn't we be friends? She's a great mother. Henry's own mother was diabetic. That contributed to her death. So when I got very, very overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you need to be radical. So I went through this fitness thing and also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms. It's very hard. And it's exhausting. Nobody likes eating carrots. Henry's career change is perhaps evident in his sleek, short-cropped beard. Ever since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been absorbed by the theatre. The Comedy of Errors followed, and then Fences by August Wilson. It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life. He started when he was only 16, working in a factory. A DJ discovered him on stage imitating people and wrote about him to New Faces. His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time." He learned on the job. Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult. Lenny in 1975 on New Faces Because his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme where people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there over five years. My family was very uncomfortable with it. I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it. It was a weird, uncomfortable position for me to be in, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with big audiences. But this "award-winning light pillar of British television for years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people." Introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked to create an alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties. The first series of The Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef! among other roles. Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just killing time or treading water a bit." Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 called What's So Great About ...? The first episode was about Shakespeare. I was really allergic to Shakespeare. I'd never really learnt about him at school and thought of him as predominantly the domain of middle class, white people in tights and a cabbage in the front. So I was very scared of it. Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it. Don't do it badly if you don't know what you're talking about. Put some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much". Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he loved it. I felt like I could do it. It was almost like someone had finally put my head on straight. "This is what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research. Rehearsals were brutal, and I read this play for months before we did it. And it was a success. They seemed to expect a car crash, and it just didn't happen. And soon he was appearing in the Comedy of Errors. Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it. There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."" There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience. "A little voice told me "You're going to have to hold over for 10 minutes while they fix the computer."" Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would go on as soon as the problem was solved. I walked off stage and something inside me said "Oh, thank God." This is not my responsibility. I can leave it to someone else. "You're in a play, so stay in character." Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre Learning the lines for Fences was challenging. Panic is very good, it strengthens the sinews. That also went down well, so it's like a big shield from the gods telling me "This is your destiny."" He says this, of course, in a THUNDER voice. So I'm sticking with it. I really love this. I love being in a rehearsal room. Henry still has the head of a comedian though - our conversation is laced with humorous outbursts as he keeps imitating people. I've decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous. If you're always looking for that, you're going to hit a wall with it. I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn't give me as much as it used to. I ask him if he'll ever do another stand-up comedy tour. The fun I have in a room with a director, helping to shape a beginning, middle and end to a journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give that up. So is this his new incarnation? I think it is. I like being an actor. It's a lot of fun. You're always telling a story, and that's great. I love stories. People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to curb 'ghost employees' Kenya has begun biometrically registering all civil servants in a bid to erase 'ghost employees' from government payrolls. Employees who fail to register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement read. The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving salary payments even after they leave the civil service. President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013. An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was being lost in payments to "ghost employees" and through other abusive financial practices. The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid into accounts after a person has died or left the civil service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi. All civil servants will now have to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure their details are recorded on biometric registrations, a government statement said. All those who did not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the payroll, the message further read. "This action will go a long way in streamlining the civil service by ascertaining the actual number of officers and also cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating 'ghost employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiring against the government", local media agencies report. Police authorities had no immediate comment. Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News. Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December. In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organised criminal group and tapping phone numbers. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays. This day is traditionally an important one for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school. There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations: September celebrations were not held in every school. The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine. We have to fight for peaceful skies. The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian popular front must fight for a peaceful sky. Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk that Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian. We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives. The first day of the new school year is celebrated traditionally, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, BBC may have found the great headmaster it needs. She arrives with a proud haul of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party. And she has frontline experience of her own. Her career began at global management consultancy Bain and Co, after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons. She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top job at parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague. Her severance package was reportedly close to £1 million. Her political ranking is also solid. She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector expertise in Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser. Her husband is a former Tory councillor. Back in May I described the chair's job as a poisoned chalice. Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure. The trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong. This makes for an almost untenable duopoly that calls for full comprehensive reform. But what incoming chairman would risk stepping up, hammering away at everything and tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps putting himself out of a job in the process. It is a difficult task. And if that wasn't enough, many are keen to see the BBC downsized - power, money and status overtaken. As competition closes in and new technologies threaten old, comfortable certainties, the upcoming licence fee negotiation poses particular dangers for the BBC. For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into what is surely the largest media company in the world. The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day. And apparently the BBC is climbing back up the popularity scale: 53 per cent now support it, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago. Viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and watch missed programmes later on my iPlayer. But it remains a much loved and considerable institution. It needs a remarkable chairman - I hope it has found him.
Texas Perry says disparaging tweet was unauthorised A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office. The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another from Perry's account disavowing the previous one. A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorised by me. "I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it," the later message said. Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Although the tweets emanated from Perry's official account, it was not clear who was actually operating the feed. The earlier tweet painted an unflattering picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013. Perry vetoed a financial grant to her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who may be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin. The text of the tweet reads, "I don't always drive drunk with three times the legal alcohol level ... But when I do, I indict Governor Perry when he blurts it out." I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas. Lehmberg's office was not charged with overseeing the grand jury investigation of Perry. That was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge. Perry has pleaded not guilty, calling the indictment a political stunt. His high-powered legal team asked the judge assigned to the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law cracking down on the longest-serving governor in Texas state history is unconstitutionally diffuse. Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign. That veto prompted a public complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group. Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous. After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential run, Perry addressed speculation that he would quit by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, here we come!"
Berkeley declares housing market back to 'normal' One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the South East of England had "returned" to normal levels. Homes in the capital were in hot demand and subject to huge price rises, prompting the Bank of England to put caps on mortgage lending in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble. Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive of high-street builder Berkeley said on Monday, "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak," adding that this provided a "stable operating environment". London's property market was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers flooded into the capital. According to information from the Land Registry, prices in the metropolitan area have jumped by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole. Average sale prices on Berkeley's private, affordable and student listings have risen by around a fifth in the past year and were around £423,000 at the end of April. However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to overseas buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible 'mansion tax' ahead of next May's general election. London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which unveiled tighter lending rules, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year. New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in mortgage approvals in July, also suggesting that the property market is cooling. Hamptions International, another property agency, revised its prediction for house price growth in London in 2015 downwards to 3 per cent, on the back of already weakening house price sentiment. Transaction volumes in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, have now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to estate agent WA Ellis. Still, the desire to own a home in the capital has been a boon for Berkeley, with the amount due for forward sales topping £2.2 billion. Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations has remained stable and as a result forward sales have also remained stable." In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007. Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent to £280 million, with sales up 18 per cent to £1.6 billion. In a statement on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said revenues for Berkeley in the current year were expected to be in line with current market expectations. The consensus of analysts is for annual pre-tax earnings of £450 million. Berkeley shares were firm at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on internet Jennifer Lawrence appearance at 85th Academy Awards. Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets. A representative for the "The Tribute to Panem" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and charged the hacker with "blatant invasion of privacy". Authorities have been notified and will prosecute anyone who continues to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence. The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a breach in Apple's online storage system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported. It's not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" also condemned the hack on Twitter. "To those of you looking at photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home - I hope you are so properly pleased with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter. However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were of her, tweeting "These so called nude pics of me are FAKE, people. Let's fight the beginnings right now. *pun intended*. Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J". They melted away, was the best way to describe it, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard box left out in the rain. Occasionally a woman would tell him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and perhaps a little prickly. And then shook his hand. Prickly he knew. He was prickly, as in hedgehog, yes. The latest victim of this prickliness was an affair just beginning, which had held more promise for relieving the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction. Ailinn Solomons was a tremulously delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a North Island village even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben. She had come south with an elderly companion whom Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a damp but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley. No one had lived in the house for several years. The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the bathrooms, slugs had left their mark on all the windows thinking they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages. It was like the house from a child's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of mystery. Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014. The shortlist will be announced next week. Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the tall grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absent-mindedly plugged into the service console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had enjoyed listening to with the shutters closed in the house. Your feet are too big. Because of their intrinsic aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console. Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - simply not played. It was successfully obsolesced, like the word obsolesce. General taste managed to do what edicts and regulations never would have done, and just as with books people chose From Dishwasher to Millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so with music they chose ballads. In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing of Ailinn's big feet in a crudely comic serenade. Ailinn did not understand. "That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips. That was what his father had always done to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth. It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little. His father had played it with his own father, or so he had told. If you started a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it cost you a penny. It hadn't been a very funny game then, and it wasn't very funny now. He knew this was expected of him, that was all. It had to explain what jazz was. Ailinn had never heard any. Jazz, even if it was not directly forbidden, was not played. Improvising was no longer fashionable. There was only room for one "if" in life. People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end. So did the mind. Its unpredictability made people nervous. And jazz was mind expressed musically. Although he had turned 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs. But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black. At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black. Again, no laws or constraints applied. A conformist society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully like those spared by fate. People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and sport, so they sang and ran. People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed, as if by nature, with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working service phone. What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates. Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly when WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED- for fear of being charged with fire-stoking, for fear even that the flames would consume them next- had opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and became depressed with inaction. Each to his own ability. Having only heard ballads, Ailinn found it hard to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music. Music was an expression of love. "They're not really offensive," Kevern said. 'Except maybe for people whose feet are too big. My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song. He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security. Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge cabbage-like leaves. Ailinn still did not understand. Why would your father have loved such a thing? He wanted to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to his lips again in her presence. She thought he was a bit odd anyway. "It seemed funny to him," he said instead. She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern's view. There was nothing else to see in the whole world but her unkempt raven-black hair. There was nothing else he wanted to see. 'If you say so,' she meant without conviction. 'But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me. She seemed genuinely concerned. Are my feet too big? He looked again. 'Your feet, not so directly. Maybe your ankles, a little bit ... And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat? Hate you? Of course I don't hate you. That's just the stupid song. He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that. "Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead. 'I'm a bit of a pervert there. That didn't sound right. It had been meant to be funny. When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the reassuring charm needed to tame the inherent cruelty in jokes. Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too. Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be. Despite his kind eyes. Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they had been drinking. Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him. In her excitement she seemed to shake like palm fronds in a storm. 'And your stubbornness is exactly why I'm perversely attracted to you,' she said .... 'Except I'm not at all. He felt sorry for her, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes as she rebelled against him. Did she think he would beat her? She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here. The same vast and icy ocean broke on the shore here as there. The same bewildered men, with even thicker skin and more morose after WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their smuggler and beachcomber ancestors had been, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman who refused or ridiculed them. Stubborn? They would have shown her a fat fist if she wasn't careful! Smooch her first - smooching was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - smooch her first and then hit her. In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since making out was itself an act of violence. Ailinn Solomons signalled him to leave through her body. He rose from the deck chair like an old man. She felt leaden too, but the force of his grief surprised her. It wasn't the end of the world. They hardly knew each other after all. She watched him move away - just as from an upstairs room her companion watched him - a man weighed down by something he himself had conjured up. Adam is leaving the garden, she thought. She felt a sudden pang for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her. A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, lacking a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not recall a single time she had seen such a thing before today? When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked down at her feet. Several years before the events just recounted, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative watchdog on public sentiment, was working on a short paper on the continued low and medium level violence in the very parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, would most likely have been expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating it. "Much has been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically rarely been felt, despite the towering steeples among the hedgerows. But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable. The higher the steeple, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse. The populace weeps at the sound of sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with tales of hardships overcome, and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former crudeness hold a firm grip on rural communities as it does on our urban fabric, but there is evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious contentiousness at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields. "You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor commented when he had read the whole report. 'I suggest you read fewer novels. Esme Nussbaum bowed her head. 'I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
   'I don't think I have to say,' Esme Nussbaum replied. 'Are you a lesbian? Again Esme invoked her right to privacy and refused to say. Feminist? Silence again. "I'm not asking this," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism. This is a prejudice-free workplace. We serve a prejudice-free society. But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally distort results such as you have presented. You yourself are obviously prejudiced against the Church, and these things you describe as "sneaky" and "crude" could just as easily be interpreted by others as expressions of a natural strength and vitality. To continue to harp on WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED, as if, if it happened, it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of its essential vitality. Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke. Behind his head, LED lettering in flamingo pink repeated the advice Ofnow had been giving the country for the last quarter century or more. Smile at your neighbour, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologise. Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love. "I understand absolutely what you are getting at," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice when she was sure her superior had finished speaking, "and I am not saying anything other than that we have not yet healed as effectively as we delude ourselves. My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED in the first place. This time, however, it is not the others on whom we take out our anger and mistrust. Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands. To suggest angelic patience. "You go too far," he said, "when you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed. You also go too far when you talk about them taking out their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others". It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "others". There was no "us" and there were no "others". It was a time of disorder, that is all we know. "Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured to interject, "no section of society can claim to have behaved well. I am not accusing anyone. Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, happened. That was then. Nothing more needs to be said about that - we agree on that. And just as no guilt needs to be assigned, so no guilt needs to be redeemed, if such redemption were appropriate and if there were a way to redeem it. But what is the past for if we do not learn from it - The past is for us to forget. If I may say something about this - Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapse. "I will consider her report," he said, and dismissed her. The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, passers-by described, had driven onto the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage". Coincidences do happen.
Lesotho military member says no coup planned; prime minister remains in South Africa Officials in Lesotho's military denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were cracking down on police officers accused of arming political fanatics. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru. The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reports of assassination threats. Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to threats from "political fanatics" whose arming by police was imminent. "What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Force staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements operating within the police force who actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to wreak havoc," he told Voice of America. South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup. "Although no one has claimed to have usurped the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup," he said. Spokespersons for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over the reins of government in Thabane's absence. Thabane disclosed that he believes he has been targeted because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country. Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to infighting in his unity government. He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Eurozone output at 13-month low Growth in eurozone manufacturing slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, a closely watched survey showed. The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from a reading of 51.8 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. New orders fell and factories saw slumps at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine. The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday. Markets are looking to the bank for a clear plan on how to deal with a faltering eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation at just 0.3%. There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give further indication later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, along the lines of that undertaken by Britain and the US during the financial crisis. "Although a little growth is better than no growth at all, the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4. Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9. France remains a worry, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation. Indications that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer working are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said. The industrial slowdown is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus. One piece of positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999. Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best that can be said for the August Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index is that after that the sector continues to grow." He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, with the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly around Russia and Ukraine - adding uncertainties to the continued challenging conditions in many countries. These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and is probably causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders. He said it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some form of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: ten years have passed since the horrific siege at the school, as the children caught up in it continue to suffer today. Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia. More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world. We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the classroom atrocity. Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine. When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil. The tragedy united West and East in revulsion, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery. Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity. We found surprising young people who overcame resistance, although the memory of that terrorist hell will haunt them forever. Their greatest hope? That the war now ravaging Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - will now come to an end. The girl photographed trying to climb back into the shot-up school gymnasium She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and became famous as she tried to climb back into the shot-up school gymnasium in just her underwear after a mine exploded. Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old. Both were presumed dead, but they survived. "A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time. My legs were covered in blood. I got up and climbed back inside to look for my mother. A soldier brought her to safety. After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday: 'Three months ago, the pain returned. I am afraid I will have to have another operation. Some shrapnel is still in my knee. Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors. "This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says pugnaciously. "It happened to me and you can't change that. Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there. My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days. The pain is too much. My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there. We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together. "I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career. I'll think about a family later. She says the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory gets a little fainter every year. I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere. When I see the photo online of me climbing back into the school, I think many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help to ensure it doesn't happen again. The boy who fled through the hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms. As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mum told me to lie down if there was an explosion and to hold her hand." After an explosion, he thought she was going to die. She said to him, "Run." Terrified she might be dead, he fled and on the way saw a crying toddler, grabbed her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets. His father Vladimir, who embraced his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died. He said, "I couldn't save her." In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and was in hospital with leg injuries, in turn assuming that her son had perished. After being reunited, she said, "I cried with joy. I couldn't believe it. He ran in and hugged me. Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie. "This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday. But I can say it's fading in my memory. I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after. But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me. "I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself. I remember these kids I used to play with in the yard and they didn't make it outside. We never say they were killed or dead. We say they stayed in the gym. I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop where I could choose anything I wanted and the ride in an open top car. But now he is afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered. That horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it. "I feel so sorry for all those who suffer atrocities," said Damir, who volunteered at a monastery last week. 'I want so much to help. I want to join the police one day and I hope they take me next year at the training academy. His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine? I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children to call out and run around, and that silence lasted for many months. She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir. The people in London were crying when I told our story. I understood then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings, and show their support. She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004. I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how that helped Damir and me. I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants. I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him. And this was just a month after the horror. I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us. She said, "I always think that this world has not got better in these 10 years. In Ukraine, the war is going on now and people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and are still being killed. They are just such children as ours. I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else. I just know what these people feel, all the horror. And I can't stop feeling it. Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it's so sad. Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all. For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities. I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there. When he was younger he suffered from this - I remember him sometimes lying down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours. Not sleeping, his eyes were open. I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy. I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again. When I recovered after the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me, with body parts lying everywhere. I was absolutely certain that there was no way my little boy could have survived in that hell. "Damir, run, run away," I remember shouting to him, but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me. But he did hear and he ran away. And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us. Georgy Ilyin, 17 The boy whose horrific picture became a symbol of the Beslan atrocities after the siege Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgy today His bloodied face was marked with fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates. His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity of Beslan. His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university. "I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, so my little boy was left there alone for three horrible days," she recalls. Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed. Only my Georgy managed to survive. The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think and talk about it. There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy. We don't think it was long ago, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me all the time. No one will ever forget, I promise you. Haunting: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalised as a statue (right). I remember that Georgij wanted so much to go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher. I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV. And now there is even this statue of Georgij crying in San Marino. Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden on the bookshelf at home. I understand that, but I also think that thanks to this picture, people all over the world feel our pain. Georgy says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again. "I doubt that we will ever know the truth. People always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth. And now they are investigating the crash of that Boeing in Ukraine. Will we ever know what caused it?
   This world is becoming something terrible. "I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen? Ten years is nothing with such pain. We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit. It affected my health and I still feel it. For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better. I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day. I thought about my friends and classmates who had been killed. That's why I always go to the gym when 1 September approaches. I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends. It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it. I don't feel like a victim, this history is now a part of my past. I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself. My life goes on. I finished school this year and am attending a medical college in Vladikavkaz. I will become a heart surgeon. My first choice was to train in the army. I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow it. I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen. Georgy Faniyev, 20 The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive. He was trapped in the gymnasium during the siege, sitting next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist. It is truly a miracle that he was not killed. "We feel it as if it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to join the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not do so because of his damaged health due to the siege. It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind. I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true. "In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a bit better afterwards, but I can't forget. And I would like to forget. 2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym. I lost consciousness. I will never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in that famous picture. Survivor: Georgy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on his laptop My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day. My friends know that I don't like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about school. Physically, I am fine. I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now. But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in Saint Petersburg like I wanted to. I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible. My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute. I have already done two years there. He is learning to treat all animals "from cats to cows". He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences. Children should not know about it and of course they should not suffer it. His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me. It is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches. I will go to the commemoration ceremonies. I know Georgy won't go. It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I wasn't. I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help. I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is marked by it. It remains in us. Georgy is an adult now, but that horror is still in him. It's hard to accept it when something so unfair happens to you. He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot participate because of his knee. He's had several operations, he can walk but he can't do sport. I would say he is 50% over the horror, but you can never fully get over it and forget it. This horrible experience will always haunt us. Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain. I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me. My son is with me and that is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart weeps for those killed. I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried. It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it to. I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital. And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions. What are these people fighting for? Why are they killing each other? War is very close to our country now and I almost can't believe it. We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now? People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed. If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible. Alyona Tskayeva, 10 The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special operations team Saved: Alyona Tskayeva is carried to safety by a Russian special operations team (left). She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege in the arms of a Russian policeman. The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in the school gymnasium. Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter. Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Kristina after his lost daughter. Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbours say. "They are one big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend. Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary. They will understand why.
Man accused of running over girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife A 78-year-old man is on trial for running over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife. Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk. The prosecution state Mr Steward was driving his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and injured the girl. Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court. Sheriff Charles Macnair QC scheduled the trial for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of equipment. The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which can be had for around $300. I took these photos at a family gathering with several cameras, all of which are available at under $350. Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results. Double check your equipment. Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed. Also adjust your camera for the photos or videos you want to take. Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimise exposure time for dim underwater conditions. And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional. Some cameras are only rated to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet. Search our buyer's guide and reviews for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models. Take multiple shots - because many won't work. Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that lets you compose images, action cams usually don't. Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to view this underwater, and getting the picture right is a matter of luck. So take lots of shots. If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it. Stay close to the surface. The light gets dramatically worse the further you get from the surface. So if possible, stay close to the surface when taking shots in a pool, lake or the sea. This will also allow you to bring more colour into your photos; the deeper you go, the less colour you will see. Get close to the subjects. This is good advice on land too, but it is even more important underwater because of the low light conditions. It is especially important if you are using an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in an organisation as gigantic as the NHS. As a consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agony of illness and the agony of treatment. Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture. Lawson knew that doctors cared about diagnoses and illnesses, while those being treated were predominantly preoccupied with something else entirely: Pain. One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began. "I wasn't feeling it," he wrote in May of that year. I had difficulty getting myself up. As he struggled with flu-like symptoms, he noted that he was impatiently blaming his wife Juliet. "I want everything now rather than later," he noted. When Juliet was away on a business trip for a week, Lawson, quite unusually and without reason, felt anxious. Something was in the air. He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest. Only a fortnight ago he had been skiing in the French Alps. The result of the X-ray was in. He was suffering from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pleura, the skin covering the lungs. As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine. For example, while some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been former smokers. But mesothelioma is different. In almost all cases, the trigger is exposure to asbestos - contact with the fibrous building material once considered a "wonder substance" but now recognised as deadly. For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease we can easily ignore. After all, asbestos is a product of the past. The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it. Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example. As an industrial hazardous substance from a different era, it seems of little concern today. But this complacency is misplaced. Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the height of a mesolthelioma epidemic. There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world. With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents. Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is because mesothelioma takes decades to develop. And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry. Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in and the shops we shop in. And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age. The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores of London to public schools, are not safe spaces. The Houses of Parliament are contaminated with asbestos. Even the hospitals, where we are supposed to get well, have been identified as sources of this deadly carcinogen. Andrew Lawson was not old. Nor was he a plumber. Indeed, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos. Then he found out. "It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I did my training for six years," he wrote. Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels. One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease? Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question, at least in part. "Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who contracted mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive." How many more of us will fall ill? Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48. When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55. That was an unusually long survival time. Fifty percent of all mesothelioma sufferers die within 8 months of diagnosis. The disease is always fatal. So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many more of us will get the disease?" The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, reckons that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to grind to a halt, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease. Most of them have no idea at the moment that this is how they will die. An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy A quick look at the records of the courts to which victims often turn for compensation shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma already is. In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos. She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street. Mrs Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S. Now she has two children in their twenties. "Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know about asbestos. I never thought it would affect me. There are very few people who know much about asbestos. The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals. The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible. Three of the six were used in construction. Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today. It has been used for roof panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even brake pads in cars. It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "major health risk" with possible fatal consequences. More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite). Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high rates of mesothelioma." A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is far from unusual. He has presented a study of those affected, outlining that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known exposure through work or in the home were probably caused by environmental asbestos contact." Much of this contact, he says, is due to the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings. It looks like no one can assume to be safe. A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even at the heart of government, may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance. In 2009, Goddard reported that the service ducts and pipework behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be stirred up by something as innocuous as "strong air movements". Members of parliament are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true. While the Parliamentary Labour Service Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given a "clean bill of health", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work needs to be done over several years to refurbish Parliament, upgrade electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 General Election MPs are more likely to meet at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre than on the green benches in Westminster. The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not managed in accordance with the relevant regulations." No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives. All that can be done now is to wait. One person who could never pinpoint contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP. Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals. "I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were ruled positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case. It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked and the dates. What he does remember clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he got some kind of fever. He was 45, and was doing an operation late at night. Suddenly I had chills. It was very sudden. I felt terrible. I didn't think I could make the drive home. As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the skin around his lungs. But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma. He didn't go to work for a month. Puzzled doctors took X-rays of his chest and put on pleural catheters to take fluid from his lungs and test it in the lab. However, his complaints remained undiagnosed. His health slowly improved and he returned to work. From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing. In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. But even now, Abbott did not connect this to his own case. After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos. The connection in the case was clear. In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts. In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the ribcage and pleura. I'm an optimist. I usually just keep going," he says. To be honest, I wasn't that worried. But Rachel, my wife, was worried. The results of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year:
   "They told me it was mesothelioma." Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer. Only now did he realise the scale of the epidemic. "It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says. The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill. And so mesothelioma is now hitting younger people who didn't work in the typical jobs. The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably more likely not exposed to the substance. But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances. It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the doctors treating them. It is still being removed today. Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats. And it doesn't just affect hospitals. Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties. Schools, too. In fact, many people probably had their first contact with asbestos in the classroom. Across the country, in thousands of chemistry classes, students have placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats. On websites, the issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently raised. And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floorboards and shed roofs have asbestos in them by default. "It's an industrial toxin that's in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his Guy's Hospital case. In one case, the only contact an affected woman could think of was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s. So be careful how you demolish your garden shed. The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense. "It takes a while to come to terms with it," says Graham Abbott. 'I went back to work and tried to get on with it, but I found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing. I was in practice for a fortnight. Then I knew I had to go and look after myself. Well, I won't have another Christmas. One of the biggest difficulties was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient. Like countless patients before him, he remembers being overwhelmed by all the information he had to cope with. "It was very hard to take it all in," he says. "I asked my doctor "how long do I have?" And they gave me about 12 months left. I remember thinking, 'Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas. That's it."" Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer. Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos. Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres. When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibres are inhaled, they can become lodged in the pleura, the skin around the lungs. Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations. "The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001. The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma. Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who are also believed to have been exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital. Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed to the edge by the breathing process, where the skin is. By nature, it's invasive to begin with. The usual options for other cancers don't work as well for mesothelioma. The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly contested. Some think it's worth a try. Treasure denies that. "You can't cut out the pleura," he says. You can't get around it with a knife. Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but doesn't cure it. "Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says. But in the end, they all die. Fortunately, some patients actually live a long time, much longer than expected. Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis. Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling. After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott got in touch with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counselling agency for fellow sufferers. "Hello, Cancer Central," he cheerfully introduced himself to callers. "He was very positive," Abbott says. He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active. Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and likely extend his life by only one month. "I was desperate," he says. I wanted to give up. Lawson, however, managed to "put things in a slightly more positive light." After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardiothoracic specialist at Guy's. "We had an advantage in that I didn't need to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits. A normal patient would have to get a referral and wait for treatment to be authorised. Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to take advantage of the best treatments available. But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave behind. And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation. Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP. "It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says. But what changed in the 1960s is that people realised that even very low levels of exposure posed a health risk. And this is where corporate negligence began to play a role. Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation settlement" as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's. However, after the inquest into his death, a Guy's spokesperson confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s." This was too late for Andrew Lawson. How asbestos can be removed In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, attributing fatal asbestos contact to a company or workplace is a huge problem - usually decades after the incidents. Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down. Insurance records may be lost. And those fighting claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs. In response, there has been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found. The law set up a £350 million fund, supported by the insurance industry, for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone. In these cases, claimants will receive 80 per cent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal compensation case - about £120,000. About 300 successful applications to the scheme are expected each year. Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks £350 million represented a "very good job" by the insurance industry. "This is a deal by insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally. Mike Penning, then work and pensions minister, also admitted that the law was "not perfect". But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven people dying every day, swift action was needed. "People are suffering so much and they need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Bill in December last year. At that point, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months. After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he, unlike Tom Treasure, expected to have a positive effect. This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 per cent. Abbott felt invigorated. "That's one of the most important things, of course," Abbott says. You see that all the time with patients. There's something there that keeps you going. If you give up, you get worse very quickly. Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012. By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy. Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease. Then I had a scan in March 2014. There were several patches of cancer around my chest. I just turned 50, it's not life-threatening. It's life-ending. Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
   Now there is no trace of the tumours. But the process is physically and mentally exhausting. You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler time setting works. When you get bad news, you become negative. You have to look ahead. As a father to Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy. "It's hard for parents," he says. 'It's hard to know what to say and how much. When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease I wouldn't grow old with. They reacted very differently. Tamsin is very social and boisterous. She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls. Ellie was more reserved. She didn't say much. These kinds of conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through. But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not infused with hope, not a hint of hope for survival. The disease brings (as it eventually did for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty. As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening. Bodies of embalmed pharaohs wrapped in asbestos clothing asbestos fibres used to reinforce cooking pots and for greater heat resistance. Pliny the Elder describes asbestos. A fabric was developed that was not flammable. I have seen napkins made of it stewed in fireplaces at banquets. The use of modern commercial asbestos began in Italy, where it is used to make paper (including bank notes) and cloth. Important asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, and shortly after in America, Italy and Russia. It is the ideal insulating material for the steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution. Global asbestos production rises to more than 30,000 tonnes a year. Statisticians at Prudential identify a premature death rate among those who work with asbestos. As a result, they no longer receive life insurance. Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale. Dr William Cooke testifies that asbestos particles in the lungs are "beyond all reasonable doubt the leading cause of death". This is the first case of its kind. Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, accept no liability. No compensation is paid. During the Second World War, ships are built intensively, one of the deadliest occupations involving asbestos contact. Industry voluntarily refrains from importing blue asbestos A Court of Appeal upholds the first successful personal injury claim in the UK for contact with asbestos. Global asbestos production rises to more than 4,213,000 tonnes annually. The UK imports 139,000 tonnes. A Health and Safety Executive in the UK requires all companies working with asbestos to obtain a licence. The import and use of blue and brown asbestos will be banned by law in the UK. All use of asbestos will be banned in the UK. The Mesothelioma Act is passed in the UK. A £350 million compensation scheme is announced. Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, however white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material in many countries around the world. Global production is around 2 million tonnes a year.
China denies Hong Kong right to elect government, protesters vow retaliation On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided against allowing Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite increased calls for democratic reform. This action is likely to fuel the long-heralded protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists began planning and mobilising for this within hours of the announcement. The Chinese People's Congress decision basically allows communist leaders to reject any candidates not loyal to Beijing. "This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party. This is not what Beijing had promised. Hong Kong residents have been lied to. And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime. Defending the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice secretary-general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said allowing public nominations in the election would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government. Since 1997, when Britain handed back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents elect the head of government from 2017. Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership will keep a tight grip on the process through a nominating committee closely controlled by Beijing. Under a new clause, moreover, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be eligible. The decision follows a summer that saw some of the largest and most publicised protests in Hong Kong for several years. Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers have threatened to seal off the financial district unless Beijing allows genuine universal suffrage. On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside government headquarters in Hong Kong within hours of the announcement. At the demonstration, organisers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned waves of protests in the coming weeks. However, they did not give further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities. In an online message, the organisers said that the movement had "only considered occupying the central district as a last resort, an action to be taken only when all chances for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice. We are sorry to say that today all chances for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place. Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and heightened security measures including police forces and barricades were in place outside Government House on Sunday. The unrest is fuelled by a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city. The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition for products and services. There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under increasing pressure from Beijing. Some criticised the Occupy Central demonstrations, saying they threatened business - Hong Kong's lifeline. "The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said rights expert Regine Ip, who has long criticised the movement. We don't want to fuel fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control. That impression is bad for investment. China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers. This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters. In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the US is now being transferred to universities, where Freshmen are being offered performances by private plane. We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand by offering the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students. To be able to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1. Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security division. This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cart their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car. Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring students reach university this year with a minimum of hassle and a maximum of luxury. A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet as the service had just been launched, but added that "students would be booking the service in the coming weeks". The company also said it expected there to be a market for the service, despite tuition fees of £9,000 per year. Students today are very different in their expectations and aspirations from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF allows you to do just that. However, the National Union of Students criticised the service for being out of touch. Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education said, "This offer seems completely disconnected from the lives of the majority of students. Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis as available financial aid in the form of loans and bursaries fails to keep pace with soaring bills for the most basic of living essentials before they can even think about spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at halls of residence.
Feminists criticise race and police behaviour after Ferguson The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. earlier this month. Participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they waited outside the funeral. After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in online discussions among white feminists. In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when addressing reproductive rights and income inequality. However, while tensions were rising in the Midwest and receiving attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's responses were 100% about race. Compared to Black women's responses shortly after the 9 August shooting, the personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late. But for Perez, it marked an important shift. "I don't think you find a lot of people in feminism talking about being white and privilege in such a high-class way," she said. People felt pressured to express something about the incidents. It's characteristic of the crisis we're in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicised that they need to express that. For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space. "I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said. If I post something about how people of colour are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening. "How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about safety in public spaces?" she asked. For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues. For her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live in the combined reality every day. While white women now conflate race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite. "Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said. White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching. For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came at the point where white campaigners for women's suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century and determined that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: Women or Blacks. "They made the decision to go for women's suffrage, and black suffrage would come later," Hattery said. When you remember things like that, you realise with power why women of colour don't trust white women. We didn't do our job well. We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons. Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organise against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching. The group was formed nearly 40 years after the original plea for help from black women, Mitchell says. For Mitchell, the spate of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the times when white feminists played "tag" with the issues black women had been grappling with for generations. "Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell. Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means. Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and posted a pointed article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll calling for more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism. "I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding an inherent danger in the body - and opinions on race that are markedly different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote. Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, addressing race as well as gender issues, some are nonetheless taken aback by her comments on race in America. Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of colour, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson stand in contrast to her earlier criticism. There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys. But when the White House recently launched a small programme, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem. The police's relationship with the black community is not the only issue that has come to the forefront of mainstream feminism. After the US Border Patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also resurfacing - this time as a women's issue. Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for the issue to be reconsidered as an essential women's issue, all she had to do was publicise the stories of immigrant women. "These speak for themselves," Mercado said. When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation. "These stories resonate with women's organisations," she said.
"Pig house" for sale in Ipswich A picture of a house for sale was removed by estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig making itself comfortable in the living room. The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is being offered for £120,000. Details included a picture of the home's living room - which included a pig that had laid its head on a sofa. Estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet. "However, the photo was published in error and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said. In the home's exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home." Although the realtor has removed the image from its website, it still appears on promotional material. The house sale generated interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW town of Harvey home to new millionaire after lottery win A lottery player from Harvey is up this month The search for a new millionaire in Perth's south-west continues, with one lucky winner receiving almost $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw. A newsagents in Harvey hit the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, following $1 million in November 2009, but the lucky winner has yet to come forward. Shop owner Steve Forward said the win was causing talk in the small town in Perth's south-west. The town is talking about nothing else and everyone is pretty excited. We thought a win like this could happen. Eight WA winners celebrated first division wins last month, a fitting end to a happy few weeks for players in the state. Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, after a Belmont couple had won a mega $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier. The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the winnings would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house. The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th first division winner in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to track Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tyre blew on lap 172, ending his evening. Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters. His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed but was now focused on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia. "I wish we would have had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said. 'We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there. Stewart crashed into a wall earlier in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired. "I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out." Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the hauler and the team was packed and ready to go. Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a cinder track race in upstate New York. He decided to return this week and win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to earn a spot in the Chase. He returned to work while an inquest into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. is investigated. The latter had stepped onto the roadway during a race to confront Stewart. Authorities said on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks. No decision has been made on whether Stewart will face charges. The three-time champion was greeted with huge cheers when he was introduced before the race. After starting in 12th position, Stewart had moved into the top 10 shortly after and was in fourth place at times. After a restart on lap 122, Busch's No. 18 car spun out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, sending both cars into the wall. Stewart continued but dropped back to 21st place.
Bulgarian prison guards stage nationwide protest Hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria staged a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia. In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed. Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov. The civil servants have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month, demanding a return to the former 24-hour shifts. Despite meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported. Negotiations are continuing, Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures Rosen Zhelyazkov told BNR. The prison employees' protest is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of Interior.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed A British woman says she thought she was dying as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years. Karin Rodgers lived most of her youth believing she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease. She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Charity CMT UK shared that misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with CMT because so little is known about the condition. Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gait and curled toes. Sufferers also experience numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time. When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very poor chance of survival. Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday. The mother of two, who is now 51, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others. I was always falling down and everything took longer with me. I could never roller skate or skateboard with the other kids and I was often teased at school because of the way I walked and ran. Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve pressure on her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she consulted her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA. "I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked up the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said. When I got a reply, I was shocked and panicked terribly. I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, slowly losing all my abilities in between. I sorted it all out on my own and planned my own funeral. She said when she turned 17 she realised her abilities hadn't diminished as much as she thought they would and consulted her doctor. He just stood up and hugged me and said, "my dear, I don't think you have that or you'd be in a wheelchair by now." I think you have something far less life threatening. After some genetic testing, she was diagnosed with CMT. "When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said. Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of the condition.
Washington-area business tax burden rises as economy recovers An economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs. It also means higher taxes. State and local tax assessments on businesses across the country rose slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception. Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase over 2012 receipts of $26.6 billion. The state and local tax burden on businesses rose 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining assessments in 2009 and 2010. State taxes rose more than local levies, by 4.3 per cent, according to the study, conducted by services agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group. More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 per cent, comes from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's revenue comes from businesses. Virginia derives the least tax revenue from businesses, 28 per cent. Much of the increase in tax revenue is rooted in a rebound in business property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent. While much of those gains came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the drain appears to apply to the Washington area as well. Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year. But the apparent rebound in property values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of business tax assessments. Businesses in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in property taxes. "Here's what's happening in Maryland: a lot of the real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profits that don't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation. Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services that other states offer. The recent rebound in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, the data show. Businesses in the region reported $2.3 billion in income taxes to state organisations, up from $2.1 billion in 2012. Maryland took in $1 billion in business income taxes, the highest amount in the region. While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not increasing equally in all three places. The rate of increase in the District was in line with the national average at 4.3 per cent, while Maryland's increase was much higher, 4.9 per cent. Only Virginia reported a below-average tax increase of 4.1 per cent. Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes at 6 percent in all three office areas (all three have fixed corporate tax rates). Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25 per cent and the District's is a relatively high 9.975 per cent. A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local business taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland. The study did not examine the District. Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour. North Carolina passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year. If the state continues to meet its revenue targets next year, this legislation could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate as low as 3 per cent by 2017. In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area appear to be doing better and, as a result, paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study. Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure under which most small businesses are organised - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than business taxes overall. The researchers say the trend and increase in business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 per cent increase in overall excess tax revenue for state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year. Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the region's job market.
Family of Joan Rivers 'keeping fingers crossed' Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness. "Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today. We are all keeping our fingers crossed. Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, according to sources. Doctors are deliberately keeping her sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which continues to be described as "serious". Reaction came from many quarters, including overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million). The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be acquired, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company. Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion was a done deal, and the collaboration also seemed natural. Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, had started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube. Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to post their bravado in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to one insider. The Twitch interface. And "let's play", a video genre in which know-it-alls give (usually older) games a veneer of secret-science theatre, are already popular on YouTube. It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when people want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was received somewhat boredly, a textbook example of an established tech company buying out a potential competitor. It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't go through, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon. All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster." Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success. For snobs like me who declare they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play rather than picking up the control console yourself. It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3am while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a weirdo get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty. All these games you could be watching right now. Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so watching them without your own control over the perspective of your gaze can be a really good recipe for a headache. I admit that the fast-forwards in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining. But unless there's a game or humour virtuoso involved, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting. But what do sceptics like me know about that? Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic. And how exactly is Amazon going to make money out of this? It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have simply swallowed Twitch. But Twitch has something every company would love to have: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers. As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.
Ice Bucket Challenge participant dislocates jaw Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so hard when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face. This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong. A woman was hospitalised after screaming so much during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw. Isabelle Roberts from the UK shrieked so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the structure of her face. "The water was so cold I screamed and while I was doing that my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror. Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old. Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident I tried to close my mouth but I couldn't, my jaw was stuck and then I understood something was wrong. My mum and sister saw it too and nearly wet themselves laughing, but I had to go to A&E. The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to hospital to have her jaw reset after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday. The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Clever ways to save on uni textbooks With uni textbooks costing many students more than $1,000 a year, almost-second-semester student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever idea to save money. He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay selling them back. "My maths book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia. The books he needed for last semester cost him $430, he said. He spent $120. College officials said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are several cost containment options available to students. Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students. Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than buying it. Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said textbook rentals have doubled since 2011. Surveys of the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, Neebo's vice president Tevor Meyer said. Less than half of all textbooks are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade group. Here's how to get the best deals. Buy online Some new books cost as little as a third online of the price they go for in the campus bookstore. The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be obtained from specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99. Buy used If you don't mind others' notes or normal signs of use, used books are a good option. "Calculus" is available used on Chegg.com for $93.49. Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business." The book sold new for $48. Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students check with their professors to see if earlier editions were acceptable. Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar papers. In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition. Apart from Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books. Renting Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course. You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of a newly purchased book. For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20. Check the policies of the shop you are renting from, including penalties, if any, for writing notes, underlining or signs of use. Renters beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book. E-books E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option. Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic licence for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc. At Chegg, one can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61. Bracey says students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive. Definitely look around. Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of books because you can be sure to find the right textbook. And before ordering online, Gault said, one should check to see if the book is actually in stock. He learned this lesson the hard way. He bought a book that had a four-week delivery time and ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a box office hit "The Expendables 3" directed by Sylvester Stallone grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed only $12 million of its $70 million budget. The Cameron Diaz-targeted "Sex Tape" grossed just $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" also disappointed in receipts. An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that when it comes to children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason. Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films, describing Dragon Taming Made Easy 2 as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel. However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older demographic, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem. In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie release that was shown on at least 2000 screens between American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and in the current year. The results are based on the opinions of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year's hit films are on par with those of last year. Some commentators suggest that the trend is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix. Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book movie, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing." We need to accept that and not try to chase the past. In contrast to the current weak box office performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated $1.2 billion in revenue from its streaming content, almost double last year's $837 million. Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised movie studios for focusing too much on film adaptations of comic books and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown". Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a kernel of truth. However, with potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, others in the film industry are more optimistic: X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical", telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the box office, and no one will be worried about business anymore."
Nato summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff There were protests by opponents of the Nato summit in Newport at the weekend. On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march. On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff outside the city hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit. Stephen Fairclough followed developments over the weekend for us and spoke to protesters who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teens flown out of Blue Mountains TWO teenage bushwalkers have been winched to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW. THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man set off on their trek shortly after midday on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath. Concerned relatives called police at about 8pm when the pair had not returned home. A search party of local police and emergency services set off and the pair were found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 11pm. The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head. Rescue workers stayed with the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning. They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
Socialists in France should "shut up and fix France," Francois Hollande's key ally said. Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their love" for the controversial Socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people. The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support. "It is our duty to stay by his side," he said to loud applause. In a mollifying gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite fierce calls for it to be relaxed by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister. On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government. But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw a spanner in the works by appearing at a meeting of renegade Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for depriving the French of "faith in their future". Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists' constant trench warfare and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months. Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls doesn't have any either, they are forced to form a new government when the old one didn't even last a summer. "And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters. She repeated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident of emerging victorious in early elections and was ready to govern. France's ruling party suffered a defeat in local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in EU elections in May. A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before Hollande's term ends in 2017. Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that French people would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment rates. "There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned. Otherwise, he said, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3bn deal with Prestige Cruises Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the industry. A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships as well as its affluent clientele while competing with bigger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N). A deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end inconclusively. Prestige Cruises' owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise. The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public. Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment. Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean. Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 per cent from 2012. Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America. It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year. The cruise industry as a whole is about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years as the middle class strengthens in emerging markets such as China and India. Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers. Prestige Cruises filed with US regulators to go public in January 2014. Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007. Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay. Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008. Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013. Genting held a 28 per cent stake, Apollo a 20 per cent stake and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 per cent stake in the company at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities. Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together own 82 per cent of the passenger capacity on US cruise ships, according to the initial application documents for the Prestige Cruises IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after election decision. A pro-Beijing group waved the Chinese flag nearby. The National People's Congress Standing Committee on Sunday passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election. All candidates must first achieve majority support from a nominating committee, which is expected to be made up of members loyal to Beijing. This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to run in the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to make good on their threat and paralyse Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests. Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leaders fear that calls for democracy will spread to other cities. Following the publication of a Beijing white paper outlining China's domination of Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching to the city's business district and staging a sit-in. Li's poll is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The vice-chairman of the standing committee's legal commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the vice-director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were to be questioned later in the day. Student activists announced they would rally outside the leaders' office in Hong Kong in the afternoon. Britain did not provide for any democratic elements in Hong Kong until the final stages of the 150-year colonial government.
Putin demands Kiev start 'statehood talks' with eastern Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region, according to Russian media reports. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests. Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he appears to have been pursuing since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists take territory and pressuring the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West. In an interview with the state-run Channel One television station, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on 18 March. The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the captured territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire. Putin pointed out that all those hoping for early peace talks in the wake of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the 26 Oct elections and as government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas are "trapped in their illusions", Itar-Tass reported. "We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said. Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk. Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskov said. This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine." The Kremlin spokesman's clarification to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the outright annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians. Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, where most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority in favour of remaining in Ukraine. Autonomy, which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade deals and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russian territory to Crimea. Annexed five months ago, the Black Sea peninsula is the home port for most of Russia's navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region. The regions between Russia's Rostov region and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislature - after new elections - should consider additions to the constitution giving the respective territories greater control over their finances and language status. But his idea of autonomy seems sharply at odds with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and inciting. Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate eye-to-eye with separatist leaders followed another rebel advance last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov. The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk in a coup that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region all the way to Crimea. For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are underway to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with a population of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance to the Crimean peninsula. Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years. "We are close to a point of no return," Poroshenko warned. Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukraine's territory. The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia to come into force in case of unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis. Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 troops entered the Donets region last week to support besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council told reporters in Kiev on Saturday. The first suspected 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion into Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal involving Australian celebs and Gabi Grecko Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who are believed to have stolen nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-list celebrities. Movie town is abuzz after a series of explicit photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence surfaced on the internet in a celebrity hacking scandal. The hacker responsible is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tribute to Panem" and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst. Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne also allegedly had private photos made public due to an iCloud leak. There are 101 celebrities on the list. Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting." All private letters and pictures should remain private. It's a shame that private information can be stolen and leaked to others. Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected "feel violated". The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying topless in a pool. Palmer's film credits include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth. Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning were unavailable for comment yesterday about the hacked images. A rep for Lawrence told TMZ, "It's a heinous invasion of privacy." Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacking in his tweet, saying, "Posting hacked pics from a mobile phone is no different than selling stolen goods." From a purely legal point of view, redistributing stolen images should not be tolerated.
