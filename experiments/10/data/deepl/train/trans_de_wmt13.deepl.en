Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most malodorous fish in the world? Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but in the world. Could the country's secret to success have something to do with the local appetite for some pretty foul-smelling fish? Take a selection of overripe cheeses. Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear. And leave them there for a week. That's pretty much how you have to imagine the nose-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies. I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. There is snow here, spectacular scenery - and that persistent smell in the air that just won't go away. Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you want your fish. When darkness descends on Norway and the weather turns colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really quite captivating speciality. "You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station but also organises the festival as a so-called "rakfisk general". All around us, people are eating small cubes of fish and consuming large amounts of alcohol to go with it. "Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," Havard says. The spirit can take away the smell. I taste a few nibbles. If you avoid getting the rakfisk near your nose, it's not bad - like sushi that has had quite a long bus ride. Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish was soaked in airtight barrels of salt water in the autumn. Then, in the depths of winter, it was taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with the help of senses dulled by alcohol. Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA. Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, lured by a thriving job market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare. Immigrants are even pouring in from Sweden, the old rival that not so long ago was far richer than Norway. Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, if stern-smelling, part of Norwegian history. It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here. But actually, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a hefty 10 euros. Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind. Here, people still hate to mention Anders Breivik by name - the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year. Instead, they only refer to the "incident of 22 July". Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders. The main reason for Norway's current wealth has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s. "But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, handing out round trays of ripe rakfisk and embodying the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. We are a - how do you say - circumspect people. Their English is impeccable, just like that of most people here. We are not very boastful, we don't like boasting. Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's earnings is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone was throwing money around that they didn't even own, Norway kept its purse tightly closed. "As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we're happy," Anna says. "And eat rakfisk, of course," she adds with a light-hearted laugh. I stand in the snow and get in line for another dish - I've had enough of rakfisk. A moose burger like this is definitely something different. I like the juicy meat. But in the evening, stinky fish is back on the menu. The hotel I'm staying at is one of several venues organising a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most olfactory challenging - fish. There is a live TV feed to a bow tie-clad emcee surrounded by plates of rakfisk. The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest. "What's your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-JÃ¼rgen?" "Here are our scores, Havard". People clap and laugh. A man falls off his chair, possibly overcome by the aquavit. But maybe it's the stern haze of all that fish after all.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start As Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people. Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. Even on better days, this is a perennially congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, blocking off several major traffic routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads. The aim, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament. On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential armband and take charge of the nation. He faces a complex task. Mexico has done well economically under Felipe Calderon's outgoing government, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years. "My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal. Before going toe-to-toe with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico. In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided. A direct man In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered. Residents of the resort credit him with developing tourism and building infrastructure. To reach the town, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built, which are a great improvement over the crumbling, bumpy roads that once existed here. Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change. "We expect real and lasting change from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a congressman for Pena Nieto's party, the PRI. Especially when it comes to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000. Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance. He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country. He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen. But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor. In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater. The place is hidden under highway overpasses and in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City itself. And the problems in the community are of a decisively urban nature. Earlier this year, the military was called in to combat drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. On a patch of wasteland near a large rubbish dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left in the last two years alone. During Governor Pena Nieto's tenure, over 1,000 women have been murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women. Pena Nieto's critics believe that, at the very least, he has not adequately addressed the problem of women's murders during his tenure. But at worst, they say, his government has closed its eyes to the problem. In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia fights tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna. According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. But her family believes she was murdered by her partner. "When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls. There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already set in. While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: justice. But it is precisely this, the family says, that she has been denied until now. The authorities have treated me as if I were a chatterbox, a troublemaker, a complainer. They want you to just accept their judgement and shut up. "But that's not possible when there were so many technicalities and omissions," she says. When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential armband on Saturday, he will also be taking on a huge responsibility. Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new president has promised to pay special attention to this problem during his term. "I hope as president he is like he was as governor," says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo. But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment Prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison Hearing looks at Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia Defence seeks dismissal of charges on grounds of overly harsh prison conditions The US Army private is accused of, of stealing thousands of confidential documents Prosecutors on Friday sought to establish that Army corporal Bradley Manning - charged with the largest disclosure of classified information in US history - missed several opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody. Cross-examining Manning during a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention at Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment. A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defence motion to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison term - Manning had testified that he had contemplated suicide in prison. The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq. The material was then published on the internet by WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information. At Friday's hearing, Fein went over forms with Manning that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he served time under enhanced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011. The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers. When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the overall treatment by the facility to be "very professional". The forms, Fein said, did not contain any complaints of mistreatment, although officers had asked Manning directly about his treatment. Manning responded that he had expressed his concerns verbally and that the officers had discussed them with him and indicated they would address them. However, they had not been recorded, he said. "They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) "no issues" and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said. The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form several months earlier. Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to have his observation status downgraded for "injury prevention". The military testified that it assigned him this restrictive status - which is one level below suicidal - for his protection and that of others. "I wanted to convince staff that I was fine and get rid of the injury prevention observation status (...) to be able to achieve what I perceived to be a higher quality of life," Manning said. Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010. He said that in Kuwait he contemplated suicide and at one point passed out due to the heat. Not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was stressful, he said. "My world shrank down to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday. I thought I was going to die in that cage. When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company, he said. He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses. Manning said he tried to keep moving, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down. He had always had to sleep with light coming into his cell from outside. If he turned over at night and guards could no longer see his face, they would wake him up to make him turn back. In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment. In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an allegation he had made in his testimony on Thursday - that he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count. Manning had testified that he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during that count. During questioning on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. He admitted, however, that no one had told him to do so. On Thursday, Manning had testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself. Manning had told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his pants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but had not done so. That night, Manning testified, his pants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell. His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his detention experiences into account and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his trial in military court. This is scheduled for early next year. The defence has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offences, while other charges considered too extreme will be challenged. The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention. The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held under the regulations that apply to all detainees held under the highest security at Quantico. The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the internet, transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents. If found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis. Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities Mexicans tend to blame emigrants - bringing hard times to their minds, he says Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the concourse and arrived at passport control when perplexity set in. Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners"). I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to. I grew up in central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life. An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian". Later I decided on "Mexican-American". But this was Mexico. And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens. I was just American. I speak Spanish, at least well enough to hold my own in that language on both ends of an interview. But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either. So I took my American passport and got in the queue for extranjeros. I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. On the agenda were all the issues you would expect when the heads of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade. Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico these days as to emigrate to the United States. He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union. And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard. Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment. Most Americans probably never give a single thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leaders at gunpoint to give them more than half their territory. But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, reminders of that event cannot be ignored. So as soon as a US government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans are squeezing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country. And the children of Montezuma are going on the warpath. And yet, in truth, Mexico's greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. Feel like talking about resentment? There are more than enough. Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not. The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree, one person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not offered an opportunity in Mexico and emigrated north. And in most cases, that person fit a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc. We are the descendants of those people, and our allegiance is to them. Not Mexico. And although we may now be living the American dream, going to good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living - not the Mexican dream. Our identity may be blurred at times, but our loyalty is not. It is clearly to the United States. Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us. This is mutual. They see us as a monument to humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough. Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough. In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure. If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left. And then we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but still somehow lost. My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent this. While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries. But many Mexican Americans I know feel they belong to neither country. We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen. One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in neither. In Mexico, we are seen as Americans. And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans. As I was to learn during my trip, there is something that complicates this relationship: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated middle class want to reestablish their ties with the diaspora. They want to appoint Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States. They want us to tell our American colleagues about how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico. Well. That's not going to happen. Too many hurt feelings. And given the inequitable income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's really a great country. I'm afraid you'll have to go it alone, amigos. Fair enough. If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago. Hmmm. Maybe we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud. Amid the usual recriminations, countless buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. But although Israelis and Palestinians seem locked in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them. The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may finally come to an end. A war that will neither be lost nor won At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate given the current situation. Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November holds, this week's fighting has emboldened hardliners on both sides. Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his grouping has suffered major losses of its own. Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants are crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to crush Hamas. In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah. And Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side. Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side. Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. Jubilant Hamas supporters believe an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah holds sway, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist stamp may be on the verge of overthrowing Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has permanently altered the balance of the region. Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time for Hamas. In contrast, the Brotherhood is related by marriage to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion. In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be a player that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States. Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion. Militarily, Hamas is no longer a threat. The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has proved its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. For a while at least, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully. Diplomatically, the United States remains steadfast in its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations in violence. Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process. Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - thanks in no small part to the barrier walls that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but which continue to expand. Netanyahu is in a good position. His Likud party, under Avigdor Lieberman, has allied itself with an even more hawkish group in the run-up to the 22 January elections. Why also coddle these devious Palestinians and let them have their own state? If they really had control of the West Bank, wouldn't they also fire rockets just like their fellow Gazans? No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them should they dare to raise their heads. Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. But the Arab Spring could throw a spanner in their works. Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties at home. Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined. A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies. That the pragmatic President Mursi joined forces with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be an auspicious sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era. Israelis should also think more long-term. While the rest of the Arab world takes tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week. Oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen. Bloody missions to push back Hamas in Gaza will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years. Both sides need an outside push The correct response is the one advocated by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: Two states with Israel ceding territory for security purposes. The hope - a small one for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more leverage to enforce this solution. Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms shipments to Gaza and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territory swaps and a shared Jerusalem. Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming application for UN observer status. Obama, too, must do his part to persuade Israel to negotiate. During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan. Far away in the White House, it seems he is equally averse to involvement. But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective. The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian uniform cigarette packaging laws come into force Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands The world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colours with neutral olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing diseased body parts and infants and children sickened by cigarette smoke. Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs from next Saturday will be the brand names, which will be printed in identical, small type. With this, Australia is introducing the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging. The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco use. In doing so, the government is basing its approach on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking by the age of 26 are 99% likely not to start afterwards. "You can see even in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess. Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on multinationals' profits, other countries are already considering similar moves. The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws. They said the laws would encourage black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes. "The laws will lead to serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on Australia's streets. Others, however, say the laws have boosted their business. Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has soared since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed in their challenge to the laws in the Australian Supreme Court two months ago. He said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and was waiting for new stock. For us, it's a good deal. Experts say the catch is the popularity of social media among the very demographic the plan is aimed at. A series of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from being sports sponsors and forced most retailers to stop displaying cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has moved to the internet. The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no control over international sites. "If you market tobacco and you only have a small area left to advertise your products, you can't avoid the internet," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney. On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in testimonials about brands written by "ordinary people". You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or is a marketing agency involved? British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws. It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of them have major trade with Australia. A WTO ruling is expected in mid-2013. According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws. Canada was the first country to mandate photographic warnings in 2001. They have since been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. Many Australian smokers are showing defiance. The images don't affect me. I just ignore them. "You just take a fag and put the pack away," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes with a photo of a mouth tumour printed on it. Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit, and that's my little girl. James Yu, operator of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in inner-city Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made restocking his shelves more difficult. "It used to take me an hour to shelve a shipment, now it takes me four," Yu says. "The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're shutting down," he adds, visibly incensed.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport when our plane broke down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. So I had plenty of time to get some thoughts on boredom. I'm not going to lie. Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and tax-free shopping, of course) are available. But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as a positive thing. If they have their way, it's OK for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally. This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting trains of thought, which may promote creativity. And because most of us stare at one screen or another almost constantly these days, the benefits of boredom no longer accrue to us. So should we welcome boredom with open arms? Yes. And no. I'll come back to that one. Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved as leisure time has increased. But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't think so. "In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says. Pompeii's house walls are adorned with Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century. And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom. According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways. After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to engage in a satisfying activity but not being able to do so". Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be. In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything. The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly". Boredom can thus sound almost like depression. But Professor Eastwood believes although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves. Sometimes we think we are bored, even if we are just having trouble concentrating. In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article. Some groups listened to a loud television programme from the adjacent room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at a low volume so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all. The people who heard the barely audible television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it and attributed their difficulties to boredom. When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors. On the other hand, if you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract you and help you not feel bored". In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and doodling, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can actually combat it by keeping individuals more physically alert. "Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske. We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a droning loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film. But some people get bored more easily than others. To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom susceptibility scale" in the 1980s. The scale includes statements like "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything". Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli. But in general, teenagers are a pretty jaded bunch. In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager. He found that 32% of the adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, whereas 23% said they were bored when they were not at school. However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored. Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have gone up or down in terms of boredom. However, he says he is certain that "young people are perceived as particularly bored", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much control over their daily routines. So back to my original question: is boredom healthy? Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and turn to gambling or drugs to relieve it - studies have shown this. On the other hand, many philosophers and authors study the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades. "With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University. But the brain doesn't always know what's best to do right now. If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll be happy. But while watching TV can provide short-term feelings of happiness, these evaporate again in the long run. So if you hand an iPad to your bored child, you may be able to stop him from being bored. But it does not teach them to entertain themselves or to control themselves, says Professor Fenske. And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another". The child not only learns to entertain itself, but also gains more self-control in other areas. I don't think we should celebrate boredom. Nor should we be too critical of it. Instead, our goal should be to feel good away from the constant barrage of activities and technology. Professor Eastwood agrees. "It sounds like we need to be bored more often. But boredom is the agonising, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says. He believes that people are really just looking for a way to switch off and relax. "In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated, it's hard to keep busy once the noise dies down."
In Colorado, no clear guideline for new marijuana law 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for an offence that will soon be legal in the state: Possession of a few sticks of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke them. According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving their car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were pulled over. After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - peccadilloes that each carry a $100 fine - and given a court date. "We are treated like criminals," Orozco said. But is he one? In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalise small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on the law than on location in hundreds of minor drug offences. Hundreds of misdemeanours involving marijuana are already being dropped here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures. Police departments will no longer prosecute adults over 21 for small-scale possession. That will be allowed by law once the new laws take effect in the next few weeks. But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative counties have announced they will continue to prosecute existing marijuana offences and are still citing people in court. At the same time, several cities, from suburban Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities. "This situation is moving so fast, I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is east of Denver. And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads in perplexity. They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013 in mind. In Washington, the view is that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana. There, the drug was first legalised for medical purposes and then for personal consumption. "Colorado has a more regulated market. So the state is good for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Regulatory Commission. But Smith also admits that no one place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide. "We have no real precedent to follow," he adds. The Washington law, called I-502, comes into effect on 6 December, also marking the end point of a grey area where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalised. And awkward practical questions will have to be resolved during this time - such as how to reconcile the state's requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis businesses within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities. "Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group. On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora stating that the DA would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences involving people over the age of 21, and that police would not seek criminal charges for those offences "effective immediately". Chief Oates added that police would continue to enforce city guidelines regulating cultivators of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be prosecuted. In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view. After the vote, he indicated his office would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly to get users to withdraw. Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other offences. "Our agency has a duty to prosecute offences that were criminal offences at the time of the offence," Buck let slip in a statement. Reactions have been mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative. Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults for possession of small amounts. District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding possession cases. "I don't think I'm going to waste my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says. Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the start that reconciling personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and the legal system would not be easy. And the conflicting reactions across the state revealed a profound discord among local officials regarding the Great Green Experiment. District attorneys are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offences and acts as a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. "They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for this that they still can't accept legalisation," he believes. As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being held up as national model cases for drug legalisation. While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue treating the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level. Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Justice Department will relent. Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that while criminal investigators are unlikely to kick down any doors to seize small amounts of the drugs, they will likely balk at condoning state-regulated marijuana businesses that are legal under the new legislation. Several Colorado cities are not even waiting for the feds to act. Even before Election Day, some local municipal governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, even though they might not open for about a year. Last week, Montrose, a city to the west, passed a six-month ban that will likely be adopted next week. "We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council. Our community voted against this amendment. We are going by what the municipality has decided to do, not what the state has decided to do. There are still many unanswered questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford for being Tory It's not just university students today who are attacked for their views It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University. Both my father and older brother had attended that university, which I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilisation - free thought and tolerance. But within two weeks of moving into Worscester College in the late 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags again, creating the first scandal of my life. My father broke down in tears. My friends were confused. The Evening Standard said I had left because I had had a problem with fellow students having sex in the next room. The writer A N Wilson mischievously declared that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups. The truth, however, was less amusing. I ran away. Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic bullying and threats. Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a public school. I had been bullied for one reason only - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my father Woodrow Wyatt, now deceased, had been a key advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I a supporter of the Conservative Party. Why am I bringing this up now? Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students on the moderate right is suffering similar persecution. The organised and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equal rights protections enjoyed by gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views. They are demanding a place on their college's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. Their situation was made worse by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University's Conservative Students' Association, driving a Rolls-Royce and flaunting a silver suit and silver-trimmed walking stick. At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees". Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the University of Nottingham's Conservative Students' Union, let slip in a Sunday newspaper, "There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities. People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met us." Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". Stephanie Cherill, 19, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Students' Association, says she has noticed a growing hostility among JCR members towards students on the moderate right. "This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says. In my first weeks at Oxford, I was part of such a minority. An incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986. Hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak. The previous year, the university had voted not to award Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education. The atmosphere would have startled even Stalinists. In the first few days of Freshers' Week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was to come. My experience was that tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but actually enjoyed taking part in it. Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial. For my first of these, I was to translate 18th century French texts into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come. "Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph". I stumbled at this. Pitt was a small man with a face like cake batter, and rather spiteful. "Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me. The other students sniggered. Tears welled up in my eyes. "I suggest they take some French lessons in your spare time - that is, if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me. I returned to my room with my head hanging. That evening I was sitting alone at dinner in the college when someone tapped me lightly on the shoulder. It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association. "I know who you are," he said kindly. Unfortunately, it is what it is. Anyone suspected of being Tory is bullied. It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. Most Tory freshers pretend to be Labour supporters. In a local pub later, I tried to pretend. I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on everything. This ploy was to prove unsuccessful. A freshman philosophy, politics and economics major, who ironically had attended Eton College, considered a conservative college, said to me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig." You are polluted. Other students shared his opinion. I was perverted and dirty. "How do Tories have sex?" one asked me. 'They hit each other, don't they? I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States. Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at Oxford University? Would I only be able to meet like-minded people after dark? Was I to turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations? The three years ahead stretched before my mind's eye into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who was based in my college. He was hated not only for being a Conservative but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her. He was rarely there. He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist determinist perspective on history. In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. "You won't be happy here," he told me. I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house, finding refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city. I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did. He seemed incredulous. During his forties, all political views were accepted. "But it's the best place in the world," he said meekly. 'They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires. Even my communist friends always displayed impeccable manners. His moist eyes clouded. 'Give it a chance. I'm sure you're just being teased. It would break my heart if you left. Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakening. One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs. During a tutorial the following week, when another history tutor had earnestly asserted that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same. Although secretly bursting with shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old fools". The relief lasted only a short time. It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. At the time he was writing two columns a week in the Murdoch Press. My door was locked. I hid in my room and after five minutes my captors gave up. When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London. I never returned. Feel free to call me a whiny wimp. But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and viciousness in an educational institution. And even more tragically, it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
