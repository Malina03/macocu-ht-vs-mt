In an emergency call, professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told police in a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers needed to come to his house.
Lamb was keen to stress that his "sweet dog" was alive, however, and probably upset, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her mobile phone.
Inside the house, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scrawled on a white pad, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This is what the letter said, according to authorities, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school campus where police say he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18am.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
A day after the university shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
Details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified to, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote about the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Social Sciences and History Department, which has a faculty of 17, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little agitated and nervous, "like there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
He taught only two online courses that year.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard for would not guarantee him an automatic path to tenure as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he was driving back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himselfwith a .38 calibre pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and education.
He earned his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent a few years trying to teach her how to play the guitar.
He was the ladies' man back then.
All the girls melted when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss apparently dated for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that abuts a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was absolutely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
They later played the odd gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various businesses online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on Sept. 5 after Lamb finished playing his guitar and harmonica to a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of banter.
Schmidt, the dead professor, ran the freshman seminar programme and specialised in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and sorority committee.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight memorial service Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the 911 call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many Christmas seasonal employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give employees and seasonal workers currently employed by it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people at shops and distribution centres across the country. It still hired 45,000 workers during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing people this month and the headcount will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to staff shops to sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment professionally for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royals, and I realise the seat next to me is empty, and it's starting to hit me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins and it occurs to me that I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really, to me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief is again calling on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the Council's five permanent member nations - the US, Russia, China, the UK and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial session later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Poll numbers that show Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a meltdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the real estate mogul's chances of winning the nomination.
Of course, it is still early in the election cycle.
No one is suggesting that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's lead was ceded to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Trump's staying power and are starting to flow their dollars to bring him down.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul favourably.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
By early August, it was 52 per cent.
Now six in 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
And those numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as their nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson manages about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment favourite, became the nominee.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters leaning Republican believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post reported on Monday.
The same figure holds true in the nation's first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in ten say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll from last week.
That's a change from when four in ten put their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four in ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is diffused among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a neck-and-neck race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.
A slim majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have their minds made up.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switching to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition right now is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made up their minds are twice as likely to back Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a linchpin in the public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep crucial Hispanics away from the Republican Party and damage the realignment effort.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will too.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of Republican voters' support, largely due to their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans in ABC/Post's new Monday poll say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a fortnight ago shows three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with congressional Republicans, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "angry as hell."
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at prime minister's question time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly anticipated
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-set questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs up close.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to give to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual conference on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and that he had recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences on the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the cap on gains.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposed to government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron across the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade since he became Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and barbed arguing, instead setting out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Business Secretary will stand in for him when he is not attending - for example when Mr Cameron is away abroad.
He has also floated the idea of other colleagues speaking up occasionally, and that he had approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later he conceded that he had failed at it.
Since it was first televised in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Hour has been seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgement and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': homeless youths trained as photographers
Johannesburg's city centre is a tough place to be if you're homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the project's first graduates.

Pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound jumped after data showed a surge in UK wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was boosted by bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of an interest rate rise.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the standout stock in the market, jumping 20% after receiving a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A deal would combine the world's two biggest brewers and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5 % after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion from a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling 4.3 % after Goldman Sachs set its rating on the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
JD Sports chief says higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this spending power will offset higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches ground-up campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA shops from an Aldi incursion in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-up campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo handing out samples in IGA shops and shop owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the food, alcohol and appliance wholesaler holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA shop business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snatch away about five per cent of the grocery market in these two states 12 months after opening its first stores, taking sales away from all existing players but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and grocery and volume on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley reckons Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash was likely within a decade. Metcash would disappear.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But a Metcash board member is understood to have contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging combined with pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to align selling prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and help IGA retailers improve their shops by growing fresh food faster and delivering a better range of private label food.
Metcash's chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and shop refurbishment programmes will gain momentum and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his conduct.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks", came into the spotlight because of Kyrgios' infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the umpire, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should hit the kid."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite upset about is the fact that in my view Thanasi got a bit involved in the altercation," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the US Open, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little bit too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits in with the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young lad and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision not to include Kyrgios in the all-important preliminary draw, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right thing to do for everyone, but assures the Canberra man will return to the team as a long-term permanent fixture."
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has moved up the ladder very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He's rising in the eyes of the public and he's made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the limelight where he can just think about it I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, detains refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants piled into a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
People fleeing violence were stuck for an unknown amount of time in a strip of land on the road between the countries' two checkpoints, erecting tents and settling there.
But frustrations mounted.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece, which were caught off guard. They expressed hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached for EU states to take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any early action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close off roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to procedurally approve the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, and 15 others had already entered deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car carrying barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and a crowd pushed to squeeze in.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground on her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 per cent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 per cent (up 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, has support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choices than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders trails by only 5 points here.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now tied.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead among this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the nominee.
Six per cent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are mostly enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say this about their frontrunner Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Also mentioned by Clinton's supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement on how to handle the problems and electability are also cited.
With the vice-president putting up a potential for the presidency, 57 per cent of Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who their second choice would be for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage who see him as the most "electable" has risen.
Still, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters cite questions about electability.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on some key characteristics among voters in their party's primaries.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden scores highest on honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him on this.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically in line with their views.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be raised about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story among the American public at large.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their overall opinions of Clinton, though 36 per cent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It is mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight percent from last month and down 15 points since May.
62 per cent of registered voters do not see her as an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive high marks in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score highest on honesty.
A majority view Sanders as more honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves up close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson finds himself close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
The two candidates now account for half of voters' support in the new poll, and others are losing support dramatically
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS poll, conducted before Fox News debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well among demographic groups and outperforming Trump among Republican voters with a college education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropping the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson rising in the polls - landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a surging Carson in the last week, Trump found some siding with the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologised for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Murder charges are being filed against five people nearly two years after a student died during a hazing ritual at a fraternity in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, weighed down with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to walk across a frozen field towards a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache, then fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
They did, however, have time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At that point, the members began hiding paraphernalia and basically put the welfare of the fraternity above that of Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived and died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, blunt force injuries were repeatedly inflicted on Deng's head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by fraternity hazing. At least one student has died from hazing every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, are also charged with hazing attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We don't want to just hold the individuals involved accountable, but if there is an organisation that sanctioned - officially or unofficially - this, we will hold them accountable as well," Mr Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
Here's what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will all take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy on how it will play out.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why representatives of the US central bank have stressed so fiercely that investors should not focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but rather on the time it will take to normalise.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been overdone.
"The Fed's first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of cheap money," Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at levels too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean there will be no impact.
Here is a look, based on historical trends, at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market saw last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike arrives, the impact is not as dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset returns to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, again perhaps reflecting the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been mostly in an uptrend over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 per cent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 per cent according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on equities tends to occur later in the increase cycle and returns begin to decline as a result.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Most notable in this case is that GDP will be near its lowest point when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal GDP been below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raises the question "whether this time is different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes have been on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at that meeting, futures traders are only giving it a 25 per cent chance.
"In our study, all hike cycles from 1950 to the present have occurred in a super-cycle of increasing momentum in GDP, eclipsing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
By contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the period observed.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike and the pattern is quite similar to the capital markets.
The main difference is that the effect is faster with bonds than with equities when they change their strategic course.
With bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together, leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns," Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What is interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do the greater part of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and so does financing their debt.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to react overwhelmingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate hikes.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) each.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure equity plays, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher yields, although experts differ on how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a carbon copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for "dumbing it down"
He argues that it is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice programme, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, a senior MP has claimed, increasing new pressure on the station to prove it is doing something private stations are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station was "dumbing down" and becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word dumbing down - but it seems to be morphing into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be The Brits just under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples given off the top of my head where you're really just imitating what's already out there," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals when it came to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and music making that's really second to none.
"And Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work was needed to engage audiences than it had done in the past because Britons were less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire for stepping on the toes of its commercial rivals during the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee hearing.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is often debated as being unoriginal and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he would like the corporation to "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launched an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or spending ratepayers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew slowest in August and Black Friday may be to blame
There was a seven per cent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015.
Last month saw the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday in November put the brakes on spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent year-on-year rise.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, it has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales picked up three years ago when shoppers started using their mobiles to make purchases.
It meant more people could shop online and people could do it in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that is levelling off and we may see that growth reduce.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been cited as one reason for slowing sales.
Experts believe that shoppers are holding back their purchases ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November each year.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rallied around their computers to get their bargains and some retailer websites crashed.
Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers fought each other over bargains, could deter shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online rather than in high street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames collapse in part on giant Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the holy site, where only days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 people injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers killed when a crane crashed through Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already given firm assurances that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands continuing to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not being used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report that detail, but said its leadership was banned from foreign travel.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, crashing into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden group did not issue statements about the collapse de crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not having up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was dispossessed by the family in the 1990s.
The crane crash came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every sane Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured people will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says time of cheap Eastern European tradesmen is over
Britons are increasingly employing tradespeople, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe is on the rise
This will lead to the opening of 200 more Screwfix shops targeting tradespeople
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed Britons are putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of using skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out the work in their homes
If you're handy with a hammer or a paintbrush for painting walls, you're apparently in a minority these days.
That's because Brits are increasingly employing tradespeople to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said a big increase in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices was now outdated.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting tradespeople and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops because eight out of ten in-store buying decisions are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among the staff.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends that show more single female households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this more towards balance.
Basically half of our customers are women with 80 per cent of the decisions to buy items made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of a UK leading company listed on the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 per cent of its team made up of women, including its chief executive and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women to join our board.
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the costs of closing shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new shops.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve.
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought the Fed would do so as recently as last week now think the Fed will hold off a little longer, keeping rates at the current 0-0.25 percent level.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at ZERO.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned markets to brace for a hike, but signs suggest the odds are stacked against it.
The decision is due to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University shooter left letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say he was "sorry" at the first killing and wanted "to be able to undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social science education lecturer at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 Monday morning
and said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 operator that police needed to send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house, but that he "won't bother anyone" but will probably be upset.
Police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shooting.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and she is "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain point Monday to tell them "he wasn't going to jail."
When officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with one shot.
Lamb received a doctorate degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his life's blue on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he battled leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw unable to play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this left the left-back in tears and will rule him out of playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then have surgery in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastically, and then this happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when you have a double fracture, it takes six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have escaped a red card and the award of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad tackle with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read, "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my road to recovery starts now, I'll be back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has added incentive to recover between now and next June with the European Championships in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the pitch with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland side at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is struggling a lot because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and then when you hear it is a very bad injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball travelling in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like that can be.
I feel very bad about it. I feel so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after being fouled by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
It's one thing every parent soon learns: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favourite children's book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, continuing, "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I love to read to my children because there always seems to be an image or message we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron ostensibly describes the book's plot, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand on the rather brief original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by granting her wish to see a real tree," one reads. However, a love interest was completely unknown to Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the synopsis of that of the Lorax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins like this: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although, yes, he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment ravaged by the money-grubbing, tree-cutting, Thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively menial PR task has been delegated to an aide who has not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text had probably come from Cameron's constituency office.

Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of expulsion from England squad, but it's still tough
Coming up against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task but looking at the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my cards.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up and the community spirit is strong; they won't carry any scars from 2012, just a youthful, positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option in attack.
Related news here: Adam Lyth is dropping out of the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is of course, for me as his head coach at Yorkshire, difficult to analyse.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even if he didn't perform that well, and I'm not surprised; he's a team man above all.
The question of how much time a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only criticism that can be levelled was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at his best - but that lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He's an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early on this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us hard.
He needs to be given at least the same chances as those in front of him, but of course this depends on the team line-up at the UAE.
The idea of having Moeen bat alongside Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, surfaced and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a batsman can't bat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there is not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before becoming an opener in 2001.
He scored three hundred runs straight away and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner and in my limited interaction with him, he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People might look at his stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there aren't a huge number of back-up spinners raising their hands and the coaches have gone for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the squad, England have made a few shrewd additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as an adviser for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I've always felt he was cut out for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can be a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used in the One-Dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no problem with that.
Some may disagree, but coaches and team setters don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember that like players, their jobs depend on results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could gain traction if the economy goes into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run deeper into trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to leader of Labour or the TUC, which fell out violently over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, as deeply mired in various crises as the EU is, and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's home-grown agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes they mostly don't want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it doesn't like them either if they put social protection at risk.
We might as well call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local bigwigs, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets slip that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously level-headed Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before things look bad for her, as happened with the overly long-suffering likes of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking ahead to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine they'll be bending over backwards to help the selfie Brits, whose energy would be better spent on preventing Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful remarks, very SNP-style, during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics the oligarchy of press barons are, but were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum that supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-Euro opportunist who made his name as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing scoundrels, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly of them, but noted that when you're in a cage with a hot gorilla, you're better handing out bananas to distract it rather than becoming its lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum spin, for Blair had put principle above the EU's unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I'll put it kindly - evolving.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-dye tendencies and the wilder climes of Tory's small-Englandism can probably all say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father struggled on TV to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "at all costs" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MPs and MPs by all accounts at their closed-door meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the maudlin bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities on EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economics, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities on Nato - Tom Watson is rock-solidly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British when it can all be meaningless?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a Tory government cost-cutting in power, which I was reminded of at Monday's launch by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "policy report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Writing in BMJ, two other researchers have asked whether the claims are "built on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed off on BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was previously reported to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel's members are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE's tobacco leadership also attended the meeting.
The group's research "tellingly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of harm for most products under most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said BMJ's claims had been responded to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence does and does not support, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health Service £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are meeting our national responsibilities.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes, which are likely to be watched by smaller audiences, in hard contested time slots against the most popular shows on its rivals and on stations such as BBC4.
After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had spent six years trying to engage with the BBC during his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea of BBC commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its enquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the licence fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least limit your output to programmes that others don't make or commission.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to get the widest possible support for its future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense of course.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax would fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such programme, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I struggle to see how this is supposed to be public service television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe it's the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo what former Sky head Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003, that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more niche public service programmes "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of licence fee, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody's watched."
They put them in a time slot where nobody ever wanted to see them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think, that for £150 a year you get great value here, but for people that £150 is a lot of money, I wonder if that's true because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC's output was now officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a cue from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and form alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have frequencies too high for human hearing to hear.
The pulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new technique called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses to people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they turn on the altered motoneurons.
The process has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said Sonogenetics may have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unimpeded and can be sent into the brain from atop the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons fair video.
Terrifying killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voiceover and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this ad for the world's biggest arms fair is a hawkish parody produced by Amnesty International to shine a spotlight on the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters being seen at bus stops and on Tube trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you travelling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the London Underground typefaces and the DLR line's trademark, which morphs into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute them in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of Allen keys that are claimed to "gain access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this billboard "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists are getting involved with activists within protest movements and realising that they need to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets commuters on the underground.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence around the arms fair ad - through a blank space on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with inventing a more realistic dodgy corporate ad, but "by blowing it in with bright colours and animation, it sticks more."
"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
'What we need now is for the British government to intervene and guarantee that torture devices are not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a US Army order for "the shoulder-fired AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."
Whatever that does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for dorm life
Eleven years ago I moved into a dorm as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now remembering the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student accommodation ranges from mildly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to gossip: People telling you where you're from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you pick out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes caught fire and they were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal meeting places, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related to this: Don't think about starting a relationship at uni
Introverts get rough treatment at university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many halls of residence form a room-to-room strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you need to leave so I can get back the energy I spent interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and text them instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
As you start uni at the height of baking mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies is less weird than the 1950s greeting "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something". So, now please smile as I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat will cause people to feign sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in dormitories.
Of course stealing chicken is stealing, but so is taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they'll say help yourself even if they're cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it in a more balanced way than my flatmate, who added washing-up liquid to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You shouldn't make noise that stops people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but that you are literally one of those people who are in a glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbours if they minded turning down the drum & bass a bit because it was three in the morning and she had an exam that morning.
They responded by playing the music even louder.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she kindly let her neighbours sleep for another two hours before she let her own music blare, locked her door and left for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student dorm?
Conversely, wouldn't it be abysmally embarrassing if you mistook a flatmate for your future spouse, made a pass at her, broke up again and then had to see her every day and perhaps witness her dragging all their mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense into your abdomen.
In that exciting moment when you realise someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between a prank and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to boomerang.
Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't staple their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping General and then selecting Software Update.
When it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message saying that the "software update failed".
To work around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush subsides or try updating via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This could potentially mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this if you use a dedicated tool, delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger during the update so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue as the phone may shut down halfway through and this could cause the update to stop.

FedEx results mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its full-year profit outlook because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the open on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp said it expects to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its earlier forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases averaging 4.9 per cent that take effect on January 4 and higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large parcels that will be levied from November.
The company said it nevertheless expected earnings to improve year-on-year due to cost cutting, higher revenue and because of growth in online retailing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "delivering solid earnings considering weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
FedEx earned $692 million in the quarter ended Aug. 31, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales in its express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
Last quarter, ground shipping revenue rose 29 per cent, but operating profit was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the open, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 per cent for the year and 17 per cent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists will spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table deciding whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests before all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximise US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too close to predict. It will be known on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Although most data show the economy growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials anxious about adding to that volatility by raising the federal funds rate - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation are going to be the primary things they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise rates, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of a hike.
This suggests a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another hike is a long way off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will keep rates on hold this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted rates at this point," he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to reassure financial markets not to panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected to raise the rate this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year has been solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has been running steadily below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tightness in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world winced late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors worried that a slowdown in China's economy would curb global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from its May high.
For Fed officials, the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If it weren't for the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the last couple of weeks, they would be tightening the reins this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts it will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so technically it should not be included in its decision-making.
But the bottom line is that the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere suggestion by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "tighten" its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA. noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market moves with seemingly no link to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited discernible effects on growth in the US", Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The recent turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where it's afraid to raise interest rates because markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
'The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think she should get ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop and offers a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious ornaments and Christmas decorations.
There's even a car section if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cookshop (good and cheap) at this shop is near the checkouts and has several takeaway options.
What's available here: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are reasonably priced and a number of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive frozen food section. Here you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and gall, natural pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even when the shop is busy, it's not hard to find a parking spot.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does this by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet for the baby can negatively affect the immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report in the wake of the Liberals' loss of the leadership, but it hasn't yielded any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to topple Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase on Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) ratings, but its numbers fell short of last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
Earlier in the year, the gap ran between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 Words with former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the coast of New Zealand with his two children scored a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes".
Seven's The X-Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00pm to 5:30pm) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and a whopping 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-Seat averaged 620,000.
The drop in ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5:30pm.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to outperform the McGuires show.

The final three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood eventually ends up with on The Bachelor has been shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three girls left will certainly reveal if she is the one who received the final rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before three becomes two, you may have inadvertently given a hint as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's final
All three women waxed lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked the question "If not you, who should receive Wood's final rose?" their answers could become spoilers as to who won the Bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name Mackay - other than themselves - as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, that's when I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and at ease with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would do well as a couple.
From her perspective, Mackay said last week's home visit made her realise that Wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realised that this is obviously not just a game - I'm unconditionally into him now," she said.
And when asked who Wood should vote for if not her, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs on Wednesday, 7:30pm, on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed strong interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were plenty of other teams sending enquiries after his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have relegated Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scrimmage the way the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first punt return Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly boosted Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his blown catch and move on to the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"It was a thing that happens, you just worry about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian tarmac.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts stopped.
4 people killed after policemen fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, appeared to produce such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group, who want a separate state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
NHC predicts 60 per cent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 per cent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 per cent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organisations that will help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an unusually personal approach in announcing the fundraising appeal on its blog.
Instead of having an executive make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go to four charities that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said initial donations raised globally will be doubled to $11 million up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for mildly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show anything," said Dr Robin Blackstone, a weight-loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgeries, or bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done on people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sleeve formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments, BMI remained about the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgical intervention, diabetes resolved completely in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only one per cent and partially in only about two per cent.
In addition, results for controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 per cent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 per cent to around 6 per cent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 per cent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality over five years, according to lead researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes for the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and were more likely to have completely overcome diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 per cent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit among surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group" with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, reversal is really hard."
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents in the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, while admirable, was inadequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the problem of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack, noting that the US's violent response led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence and that has produced unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in hand sanitizer ingestion by children in last 4 years
Poison control centres in the US are reporting a nearly 400 per cent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing strong alcohol hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer ingestion among children under 12 reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly getting these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or for a dare on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking disinfectant just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children may be lured by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitisers) are those that are scented.
There are sanitisers with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitisers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
Especially for young children, just a few squirts can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Control Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 station in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children get to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently ingested four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered drunk for an adult, said Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and to store hand sanitizer out of the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health workers suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "mean" teacher by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banned them from her room.
Police considered the foiled plan "gossip" and referred disciplinary action to the school authorities.
Rumour mill: no disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, with Deila admitting the Hoops are in a bad place but that he will turn it around.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson allegation and Warburton wary of January new signings that could destroy squad unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic for the Dons.
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths. The latter insisted that he and his team-mates are not under heightened scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of title contention in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show highlights of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because Rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about Rangers coming back.
They are talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see those games.
I will turn things around, vows Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League elimination was followed by defeat to 10-man Aberdeen, who are now five points clear at the top of the table.
However, Deila said, "Celtic have had bad times before and we will be back."
Now we want to get out of there as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we need to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new signings and insists he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different to the summer window."
The players that come in in the summer have that pre-season time to integrate, which you've seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been troubled by a troublesome ankle for two years and failed to make the exit from Wales this summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2 but the defender's red card was later rescinded - Collum's third red card revoked in eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on any performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after he admitted singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I won't go back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice board has faith in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We will get the boys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to get 'messy win' against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see off a seventh successive league win which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's no team that's won everything, in cup games or leagues that haven't won games like that at times."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of people in work now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation first came through his best friend back in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to dread it.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in the US, and because there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who gets chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it emotionlessly.
I can't.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'll just have to try and remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story any way he wants and you get access.
I complained to her.
She conceded that she 'could have worded it better' but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I have told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've done.
I won't go into all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is insufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to get out of Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry as he persuaded the Canning River man to come out.
An attempt by a Perth man to lose police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow, swampy water just metres from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore."
Canning Vale Police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water- saying 'I can't get out, come and get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to get away," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a breathalyser test and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims Racing Victoria stewards tried to spy on him in his stables last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria's stewards and integrity department, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for race-day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and had found himself in difficult circumstances when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample on Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had kept a low profile for 18 months over the spying allegations and didn't want it to "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I intended to say nothing about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I then have to think about what I'm doing with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I was doing inside my stables," Moody told racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly hold their noses for failing in their attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL were aware of this at the time and still are.
Should this lead me to believe that it is becoming personal?
Has the RVL acted cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take away my licence and disown me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making them think about that now.
But I'm at the point now where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put the pressure on her and push her to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with Lidari's prolonged Cobalt investigation, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his licence across the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which it was.
But it also had it like that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the pack treatment on race day. An investigation into the matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all realise we need rules, but here they have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after hit and run
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent hit-and-run in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia man turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with hit and run and failing to render assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rival over wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as "agenda-setting" by two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" with his team during the Storm's high-scoring win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled comment about the Storm team after his side's final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "showcase" of rugby league and said the Queensland two were not "too good" at wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two leading coaches gave him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year. But in the last six weeks we've made our contact at tackles a real focus, and that's turned it around for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach. So he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this keeps coming up at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premiership in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
'I remember in 2010 St George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said he wouldn't give a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have those kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like them.
I'm building stronger confidence because they're saying those things because they're a bit worried about having to play us.
Six weeks ago, I don't think they were thinking about us when it came to Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm v Roosters game had a higher score than the Broncos v Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18, there were two more tries in our game, but is that an exciting game ?
Or is making breaks and not scoring something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we will still face them at one stage.
The Storm team are off this weekend as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Tickets go on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man bailed $200,000 after drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for his attempt to gain possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-accused at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilogrammes of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he attempted to possess the entire quantity and that could have been at the café for an innocent reason.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic's flight risk.
He has clear ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 bail as security to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of $200,000 security is a real financial burden," Justice Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on conditions that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and abide by a 18:00-06:00 curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure paedophile into sending pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up to discover the phone missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police dealt with it and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court "he said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people".
He admitted the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear on the register of sexual offenders, arguing that there was "no significant sexual element" to his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentencing until October to obtain social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in the case but was remanded in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders' register before the date of the verdict.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes fake speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall quickly went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims from opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and that they had been warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with boos.
Last month, they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation Address in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's address.
"The message is from a number that is not displayed but it is titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns affected MPs that immunity in parliament ends and once they leave, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said the Morgan Tsvangirai-led party was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the company's services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of more than $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who is expected to lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses to help companies transition to a new style of doing business," Whitman said.
'As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses," according to a company statement.
It splits up a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the move away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in the sector, based on the belief that narrowly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal FC captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championships is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere finished last season strongly after suffering a separate ankle injury and then regained his old momentum during pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the inherent risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return mid-season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern developing.
The Premier Injuries Ltd investigation records 23 different illnesses for Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rates over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilises, I'm confident he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is lining up a rotation within the squad.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also start Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most intimidating venues in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games, having launched their "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation to Monaco and remains driven by distant hopes of working with his management to guide the club to their first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out for Arsenal.
We came very close in 2006, but on the other hand I've been in the business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships.
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially in light of how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods," their chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first for a friendship to work.
In the age of communication conducted via social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned on its head.
Each character was defined not by their work, but by their personality, which shone through their interactions as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfy armchairs, and Ross's longing for Rachel all came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone counselling worker explained it to me.... "my listening role to people who are feeling depressed and suicidal has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase 'I can handle it' has a huge impact, like feeling like it's perceived as weakness to talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're attending Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the set completely revamped to celebrate, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends airs on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG crush Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Di Maria scores on his Champions League debut on Tuesday to help PSG move past Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as PSG set the French champions on their way, but they missed a series of opportunities after that before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a 61st-minute header.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtyor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualification for the knockout rounds but improvement en route to the quarter-finals in each of their last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game from Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was later substituted in the match against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems for our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to perfect as the season goes on," Blanc said.
"It's a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that held on for a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in the First Division at the weekend, but he was cut out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was tipped as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was acquired from Manchester United last month and he hinted at why when he ran on to Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmo defence before finishing beautifully past Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone thought PSG were going to pull off a big win, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, entered kick-off with nine internationals on the pitch and, with a five-man defence and two lined up deep in midfield, were tough opponents.
But apart from a Nikola Djurdjic shot that went wide of Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves away at times, with some misplaced passes and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who fluffed no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then abandoned after Cavani put him in after the restart.
Still, he showed much more skill in bringing his teammates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a spinning shot that was deflected past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. It was the Uruguayan's sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had latched onto a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any thoughts of Malmö getting back into the game and only an excellent intervention from Wiland at point-blank range to stop David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were playing a class above his team and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered Glencore said in a statement it sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating effect on markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60p on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of broader plans to pay down about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence a share, a 2.4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price.
It gave up 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, with coal, copper and other commodity prices down 20 to 40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on 25 September and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US president and first lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also allowing President Obama and President Xi to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and its growing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity, saying it is not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in reference to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we're going to talk about diversity, do it in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
Brown responded in shock, with insulted disbelief, exclaiming " Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the The Martian actor's comments solidified.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to challenge people to think about - whoever the director is going to be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she is a hooker who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People lobbied finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon retorted that directing them "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her - that is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made an impact nationwide, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of colour.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sport climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, had never seen a contestant complete all levels of their obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The final task included climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the gruelling Stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock over winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never made more than $10,000 or had more than $10,000 to live on," Isaac told E! about his pile of cash.
So all of a sudden ... like I can't even imagine what that's like ... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first to ever finish the course, doesn't receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beaten by anyone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had reversed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an Eighth Season, with filming set to begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to move within one game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter what," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept up his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out six in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was just his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard to pitch every game in the bullpen, so I want to be completely focused going into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (batting practice), looked significantly better in the bullpen, and he took it right into the game.
Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back in the game.
Centre fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out before he was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, before rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano ripped a two-run single off right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners on and the final run at second, Verhagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Mauer hit an RBI double off Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon to make the score 5-4.
The right-hander, however, struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a not-yet-mobile Phil Hughes to open the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the injured list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back ailment.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I got going and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to J.D. Martinez brought in Victor Martinez, who hit a single "up the middle" for the game's first run.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-21 hitting streak with the runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single down the right side, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers went ahead in the second, scoring on a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by centre fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring nothing in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes yielded three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was ruled out because of a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is expected to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Morris will come off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has missed since Aug. 20 because of a right hip strain.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will pitch against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Xi urges economy to open wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in an address to the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Encouraging start-ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a series of policies, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax border control policies, encourage state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to raise private capital, and overhaul the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up to identify sectors and enterprises that are not eligible for investment.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programmes.
The initiative is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a business environment based on the rule of law and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More areas will be opened to private investment as part of a bid to open up state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged enterprises and provide better services to them," the statement said.
It will also make it easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residency or the "green card" by streamlining requirements and making the application process easier.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practice and appointing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
