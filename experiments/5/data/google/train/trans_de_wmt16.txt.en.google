In an emergency call Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly delicate voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" still live and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo I could undo, I loved Amy and she is the only womanwhich ever loved me. "According to the authorities, this was in the letter, and he was signed by LAMB.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, taught, has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he, according to the police, a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt,the door to his office shot and killed.
Delta State University Policeichef Lynn Bufford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb has made the fateful emergency call at some point.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police pitched him.
One day after the shootout in the university, the students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal prehistory.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people", with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty covers 17 members, and many students visited courses from both.
At the same time there were some inclinations on problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes said that lamb told him that he had stressed at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he has any health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which LAMB had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Of course there was something in MR Lambs's idea."
These are questions that LAMB can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, the police later found Lambs's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car ran in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew people who lived there.
LAMB grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in the spring in pedagogy.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met with common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her guitar game.
He was at that time the woman's swarm.
All girls melted when he was there, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate from a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which adjacates a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
LAMB met Prensiss as he and Abigail performed both three years ago on a summer repurchase.
Later they played together one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at the Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5th, after Lamb his guitar andHarmonica game finished before a sparse audience ended.
There were no signs that something did not agree.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were tidying up and joked together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the Tote Professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people took part on Tuesday evening, including lecturers, employees, students and members of the community on a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's Ms. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the University choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to return our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call Prensiss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two there are everhave married.

Michael J. Fox kids about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat is empty next to me, and it will gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back inTime ".
The movie begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawning and a poor length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation about "Back to the Future", presented interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "Unstreated the greatest time travel movie ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his answer to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of almost five years conflict, and more weapons become violence and misery for millions of people only worsen.
The UN boss again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday, that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Five Standing Member Nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the edge of the Ministers meeting of the General Assembly this month, to the location in Syriato discuss.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban demanded the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in managing the crisis in Syria, which they have proven to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey values show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks for surveys down, it did not work (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national surveys Donald Trump showed in the double-digit area, and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nomination of real estate Mogul.
Of course it is still too early in the electoral period.
Nobody claims that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, of which no one also won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super Pac and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to fall.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popular values have rotated 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of Monmouth University showed that only two of ten republics saw the real estate Mogul positively.
It was 40 percent by mid-July.
It was 52 percent in early August.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers stick to early states.
A QuinnoPiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN / ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they were either "excited" or "satisfied" when Trump would nominate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "excited" vs. 40 percent, which say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the Establishment, would be candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticized widely for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, such ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is valid in the first Regional Code of the Nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality in order to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temperament does not fit into the white house, such as ABC / post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When you put on your scholar hats, Republican voters hold Trump for Real.
If you are asked who most likely wins the GOP nomination, say four out of ten of the CNN / ORC 's survey that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put your money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four of ten republican people thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that a variety of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans collected around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffusely.
But a survey of Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other republican candidates, Trump's majority support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, from Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald-Trump fans says they have formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that just more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have fixed their voices.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and nobody can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgical Ben Carson, but voters saying that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they match Trump's immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his election campaign two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapist", the immigration was in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic version of Trump will keep crucial Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC / post office survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump for immigration issues.
As long as the immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump seems to do so.
The frustration over the government climbs to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, around half of the support of republican voters, especially through their outsider status is eliminated.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / post, they prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience.
And they are also angry on Washington.
A survey of the Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated over the Republicans in the congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly annoyed".
Jeremy Corbyns debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected in the questionnaire of the prime minister with tension
The new Labor Chair Jeremy Corbyn should give his debut in the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and call for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to put the first of its six questions shortly after noon, whereby its performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labor MEPs from proximity.
He demanded "fewer theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary audit of Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after its appointment, it comes to the member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labor Chairman, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and is the focus of several types of titles.Stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention
A spokesman of Mr Corbyn said he would have been "in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldentum of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of MR Corbyns Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program, he had advised the Labor Chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in MR Corbyn's top team, and they invoke differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The Political Correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labor, according to MR Corbyns's statements on the European Union and the Limitation.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the Shadow Working and Pension Minister said that the party was "very clear" that she was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,000 £ to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor Chairman, who has been opposite David Cameron, since he is Tory boss in the last decade across the Dispatch box in parliament.
The Labor Chair, who promised another policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The ISLINGTON NORTH MP has said that the questionnaire of the prime minister is too confrontational, and that he is refrigerated both "impact eagerism" and the quarrel with a barb and instead has made itself on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young peopleto concentrate.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Economic Minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word, and that he addressed John Bercow, the spokesman of the Unterhaus, to discuss the problem.
When he was leader in 2005, MR Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theater", which is often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister.But several years later he acknowledged that he failed in it.
Since she was first sent in 1990 on television, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and its leadership in the Unterhaus and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued, she has become a cartoon and neededfar-reaching reforms.

Pound rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose jumping according to data that shows an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom.In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the bidding goal of Sabmiller.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% over the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and rated assessments for an interest increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $ 1.5505 and climbed to 1.84% compared to the euro to € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
Sabmiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20% after the transfer offer of the rivals from Inbev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grassch.
Burberry shares were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales include all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - reigned growth again.
Shares from Glencore rose 5% after the mountaineering said that he took $ 2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt collection.
The shares of the packaging and paper company MONDI were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company rating on "selling".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported a pilot earnings of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for higher labor costs with his company, he says.
The costs could make the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
MetCash launches the downtime campaign to combat ALDI
MetCash tries to protect the IGA branches in front of an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler MetCash has started a downtime campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million ALDI invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen MetCash and IgA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IgA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing over the socialMedia, as well as events like adelaide show.
IgA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice makers Simmo from Dunsborough distributed in Iga stores samples and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football league in loyal customers.
It is expected that MetCash released further details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy date.
There is a lot on the game, as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of MetCash's IGA store shops and generate higher profit margins as MetCash's IGA network in the Baltic States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent inthe East States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi's twelve months after the opening of its first markets is about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers sales.
According to a report published this week, the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and MetCash $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This prognosis is based on the assumption that ALDI will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts of MetCash's high fixed cost base could cost MetCash around $ 13 million earnings before interest and taxes, MR Kierath said.
At the same time, MetCash loses market share in the Baltic States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are loyalist.
Morgan Stanley assumes that MetCash's food and grocery sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share of 14 percent in 201510.3 percent by 2020 will be reduced.
Last week, the leading fund manager told Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, in a business lunch in Melbourne, that MetCash probably within a decade.Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board of MetCash has contacted MR Douglass last week.
IGAS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from MetCash's food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resides and invests more than $ 150 million to ensure sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops through rapidly growing fresh foods and better choice of private labelFood to deliver.
Metcash's Chief Managing Director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading renovation programs will grow in Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise as criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy rather praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special KS", came into the limelight by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon afterwards, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice through the referee, with Harrison, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he crashed a tennis racket after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth's second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing about which I'm pretty much emerging is the fact that after my view Thanasi was a little pulled into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost the US Open because of a spasm, but he is not the first player who broke a racket from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that heNot proud of it.
But, really, he has considered extremely well in the US open, even among the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he earns much recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he trains hard, he is good inShape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I believe he deserves to be assessed according to his own merit.
Healy supported the decision to not consider Cyrgios in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as a long-term integral part into the teamto return."
"First, we wish the team to be fully concentrated on the competition and not all the controversies all around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has quickly managed the climb, whereupon people like Federer and Murray pointed out.He rises in the eyes of the public, and he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to understand the consequences of his actions.Some time outside the ramp light in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all the trying to get illegally in the country.Everything with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no man's country and serbian officials with indignation.
The people who fled violence was stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
As a police helicopter over them, the migrants skimped "opens the border!"and shouted insults against the Hungarian standby police.
Some meadows from protest food and water back.
Serbia's Foreign Minister explained that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be returned, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation block in a disputed meeting in Brussels could not make common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the surprised Italy and Greece.They expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU countries would record another 120,000 refugees, including some of Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
Hungary, however, did not put his hopes for an early action of Brussels or his neighbors.
The emergency, which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions, gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could shut off roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plan to build a barbed wire fence along his border to Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie d'Agata reported that even prison disposals in the race, the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and to the topic in the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are, which are looking for a better life, and not to have war refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany, stands.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4-meter (13 feet) high fence, which the government had to build along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime.These laws also set higher prison sentences for condemned traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the Notz state," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree with the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Land Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities encrypt 45 people while trying to cross the border to cross 15 other were already deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offenses according to the new laws.
Authorities are to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the limits had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the most important limit crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to push in there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important highway combination of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's leader in front of Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her to ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the preambles (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced whether he is running for the presidential office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the preambles.
More than five months before the start of the premises, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their minds are established, which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News Survey, Clinton has lost in a series of demographic groups while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a great advantage in women and temperate, but these protrusions have decreased.
Your support with the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has volatilized, and she and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a large advantage of the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with double-digit lead in the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the preambles nationwide say they would help with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support you with some reserved and another 15 percent would only support you because it is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about it.
The views are more mixed at those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the preamections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate, is the most common answer that they have the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time that a woman is presidentialbecomes (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
From Clinton's supporters, their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned.
Approval of dealing with the problems and the eligibility will also be quoted.
Since the Vice President casts a potential for the presidential office in the Waagschale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the preamections would like to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not do it.
If democratic voters are asked for the preamections who would be their second choice for the party, biders are at the top.
From Clinton's trailers say more than half that biders were their second choice far from Sanders.
If bidets decide not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's advantage increases from Sanders, from 20 points with bidets in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the choice;However, this number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is at a distance a second in this measurement, but the percentage that looks at him as the "selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked about what is more important in a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Similar to last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters of the preambles as unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics in voters of the preamections of their party.
Measures consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden equipped as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts best in the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the preambles generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voter has no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continued during the term of office as a foreign minister, most democratic voters of the preamections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions.
But it is a different story in the American public overall.
Half of the Americans is now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions had deteriorated.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for you under registered voters Overall: only 32 percent they see as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades at lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are best at honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as Carson many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the preambles is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close to National Survey behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest Survey of CBS News / New York Times close to Donald Trump
On the two candidates now eliminates half of the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically stopping
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number nationwide.Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News Debate last month, 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and trump surpasses under republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is bottled with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, which is the deepest favor, from 10% support last month to 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are located 6% on third place.
The bug margin at the sample of 376 persons of republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, which was released last week, shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he lands at 19% support in the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed trump in front of Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side bushes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's belief in question.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a baruch college neutlings burdened
Almost two years after a student during a harassment rituals of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, died, murder claims are submitted against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-PSI Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Civil servants said he had been burdened with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-PSI Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became fainted and allegedly waited an hour before she brought him into a hospital, the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothing, Googling his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to catch up with advice, Policeichef Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide utensils and basically put the well-being of the brotherhood about that of Michael Deng," Policeichef Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly added with blunt force injuries to head, hull and thighs.
"Too many families were destroyed by the brotherhood harness. At least a student has been at the harassment since 1970 every year on the harassment," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members have to be accounted for, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended an indictment for the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including MR Meng, are also charged with harsh attacks and formation of a criminal association.
"Not only do we want to do the persons involved, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficial - has sanctioned, so we will also draw them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
That will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike comes, and the bouquet is wavering, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will glide into a recession.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long that will last and how long it will stop.
In particular, the history offers only small instructions for the economy for the economy.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, albeit not always, a factor in which the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have emphasized so violently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement may be exaggerated due to an interest rate increase.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to seismic shock that many seem to be afraid.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things for a while volatile.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a tendency that asset income is covered 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said German-Bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after interest rate hikes of the Fed.
More specifically, the market is usually in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate increase, quite flat in the 250 days later (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days,With an average return in recent six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll, Chief Plant Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, published by Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable here that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect that this will last and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question, "if it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made a number of interest rates of the Fed all year round, and all eyes were addressed to the Session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, ending on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trade gives only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all elevation cycles have taken place from 1950 to this day in a super cycle with increasing momentum of GDP and pre-recession levels were put into shades very quickly after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession;The record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also Volatil, as the market is anticipating an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar as in the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than equities when changing their strategic course.
For bonds, returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists from Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful, higher yields to be expected," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Is interesting, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, loan spanes have expanded and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from increasing interest rates and become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse than a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that" quality "shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers.
Companies with a strong balance have surpassed companies with a weak balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns as well as low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt become a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts are different, how quickly that will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Parliament member Andrew Bingham
The conservative member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster because of his "dumb"
He argues that he is not increasingly to be distinguished by commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated the Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked the program The Voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "is converted to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of the parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private channels do not.
The conservative deputy Andrew Bingham also said the BBC-Bossen that the public radio station "edges" and increasingly no longer distinguish from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I do not like the word" sleeping "- but it seems to transform to Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, who started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, starting last year, seem to be the Brits only under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, where they actually imitate only that, which is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from his commercial competitors, when it comes to the live music and educate the public.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works, I also really consider it important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harders need to work on it to engage the audience when this did in the past because the British is less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, which was under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sports under fire to kick the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory-deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the Musical Talent Show of the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for esteemed cost of £ 22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge "on a special BBC manner".
He added that he wishes that the company "find a hit from our in-house stable" when the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to issue money of the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose at the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday braked the expenses in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain has turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagnate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers recorded only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, as a buyer started making purchases with their cell phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, eg.B. at home on the sofa.
But now that commutes, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers retire their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers spent around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when the buyers fighting for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £ issues were issued a little more than 1 £ online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now being conducted via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.

Saudi Arabia lays the collapse part of the huge Saudi bin-shop group to the load

B & Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has an increase behind
This means that 200 other Screwfix stores, which aim at craftsmen, are opened
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B & Q sales outlets close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chef Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their home
If you can handle a hammer or brush for painting walls, they are apparently to a minority today.
Because British increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out home improvement jobs in their homes, so the head of the company behind B & Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the hardware store chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at low prices is now overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which focus on craftsmen and close 60 outlets of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to engage more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women.
At the moment the men outweigh the men.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trend, which have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "There is still a majority of men in our stores.
We have to move this more closely to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers from women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles through women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, which is one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also recovered its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the semi-annual profit and sales after the group shoulder the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q possesses, open 200 new branches.
Time of Decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is observed if the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision, whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not.
A survey under 80 economists questioned from Reuters found that a little more than half, which was still last week, that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will remain a bit longer and longerThe interest rates at the current state of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold.
It is a historic event because it's seven years since the Fed interest rates added to zero.
"For the first time, we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, executive staff at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy outlook on global circumstances.
She has warned the markets to build an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances of such a step are good.
The decision should be announced at 20.00 o'clock Mez on Thursday
Death contactors at the Delta State University left the letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague later on the day and killed - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted him "He could undo it, "Governments announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And said he had shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employee of the emergency call center that the police must send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" And he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but who will bother, "but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
LAMB gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
After writing the note, LAMB drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, as police officers surrounded him.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Of course there was something in MR Lambs's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there are no information, no evidence "for a" triangle relationship ".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who had said that they were married for about seven years as a "good person" described.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.

LAMB received a doctorate in the spring of 2015 by Delta State University, as his lifetime indicates on the University's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor has allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was condemned for drug ownership.
All that certainly demands his tribute.
Luke Shaw by Manchester United can not play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left-edge protein to cry and exclude him from the gaming for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and lies in the hospital."
He will be laid tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it has very hard and then playing fantastic, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very worse attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your news. Words can not describe how broken I'm, my way to recovery starts now, I'll get back more."
Related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next time.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad violation."
If a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break, when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if they hear that it is a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction, so it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something can be.
I feel very bad.I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul of Chris Smalling.
Certainly David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It's a thing that will soon learn all the parents: If your child loves a book, it will not take long for you to know it almost memorized.
Unless they may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, which was published in 1971, decided.Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company Supercamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read my children, because it always seemsgive a picture or message we have missed so far. "
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead reproduces a content indication of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Tverned-Ville, where all the nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by seeing her desire to see a real tree, fulfilled, "you read.A love interest was Dr. med.Seuss whose right name was Theodor Sussel Geisle and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled town of Tverned-Ville, whereEverything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams. "
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar to the action of the book.Here is an unnamed boy, as the local environment is devastated by the packed, trees felling, tianed knitting once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous lorax, a squatting, mouthful nature, "that speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper, which the Lorax has not read a child 20 times a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
Supercamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees were delivered but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still hard
On Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, a difficult task is, but if you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not exclude a away win.
Alastair Cooks page may experience less than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong;You will not carry scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on test level, an option for the attack is.
Referring message: Adam Lyth is leaving from the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.
At its seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are geared to results.
There was no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, there - and I said earlier - players are their own best selects.
Long ago, the run of Lyth had been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopefully sticks out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
The England Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not bring such good services, and that does not surprise me;He is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman receives to put his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to home and away games.
The only reproach that you can collect was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was high - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman I amazing high.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which made us a lot.
He must receive at least the same opportunities like that before him, but of course this depends on the team's assignment in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of making Moeen besides Cook, which would provide an extra-spin-bowler and received four quicks, dived, and I do not mind.
I do not see why a batsman can not beat there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a devil guy of Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as Opener in 2001.
He made three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the squad as back-up spinner, and in my limited handling of him he impressed me as a young man.
People may see their statistics on - on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game, which will bring a wealth of experiences, as he played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as coach, and how Mahela he has insighted, of which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team displays do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that as the players depend on their jobs from the results.
Such decisions are not hit slightly.
The Brexit Warehouse (Brexit = Exit United Kingdom from the EU) could win in the event when the economy until 2017 in a lull device
David Cameron's uneasant new negotiation strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU, with each day is deeper in trouble, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy "is it or no?"Corbyn to the leader of Labor or the TUC, which deals violently because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend said the other day that some member states, so deeply entangled into various crises, as the EU is it and not always from his own guilt, Great Britain self-created agenda with split concessions and disturbing contract changes that they usually do not want to be full.
In Brighton, TUC decided on its annual meeting that it does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Climbing on Summit or Bilateral Meetings in Foreign Capitades, take a picture of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend who wishes to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - "Do not let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets you see more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals to the pointare where it does not matter if we stay or go.
Germany's carnivated Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been on power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it comes to the exaggerated long, like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14)and cabbage (16) has happened.
France François Hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear out a leg to help the Selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's escape from the UK - something they do not want, because mosthave similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may purposely do not intentionally do not helpful comments, in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, suspects my friend.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Great Britain has not won anything of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how robbery the Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics is the oligarchy of the press linch, as they were during the Tony Benn inspired referendum 1975, but our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1 supported.
You can remember weak to Boris Johnson, the Ore euro opportunists who made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his craziness, ED Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-female villains, telephone-chopping foreigners and the pseudo non-national, which own most of our great newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but stated that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distribute it instead of being lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians as Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum vertebra, because Blair had set the principle of the unattended constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which he had a back dooropened.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs to waste for me - seems to be in danger, Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80'sRepeat, a mistake then and today.
It can take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position is to Europe - I'll keep it friendly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional Blaufloff tendency and the poached clads of Tory's Klein-Englishism can probably say everyone.
It is what Hilary "a Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week said, when the scout fought in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell was a bad idea as a shadow chancellor.
It reminded me of the 70's years when his old father was trying on television to be illoyally to his Labor Cabinet's colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, still told JC to his colleagues and deputies after all reports on their clausing meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even stirred me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media,a breeding area of Paranoia and betrayal.
It's right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities for EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion under left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle ofDogmatic disputes is.
As with its ambiguity to NATO - Tom Watson, Felsenfest is convinced that JC does not start his campaign - foreign diplomats are required to try to find in all a sense of their supervisors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin wasten political capital - - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be meaningless?
The USA is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was recalled at the start on Monday of something British Influence Security Forum called.
Experts criticize report by public health england over e-cigarettes
Allegations of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) closed Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
Phe published the "principle report" last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which Phe established its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the allegations "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies are based on proof of efficacyshould."
They said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to their opinions about the damage of different nicotineto lead contemporary products to a synthesis;The results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euroswiss Health, whose managing director is previously received by British American Tobacco Medium (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing he should have received after reports by the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the panel are not delivered, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also provide industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco management of Phe participated.
The research work of the group "announces significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evaluations for the damage of most products in most criteria", McCee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "there are no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a path to smoking for children or non-smokers" premoured.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Phe, said that the allegations of BMJ has already been reacted before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies at his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
Phe has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the proof occupies and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to the tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually at a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
Due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop programs like Eastenders and The Voice.He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arms" for hit shows as the Albert Square SOAP.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC to place public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and transmitters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 in contact with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sending, which would also be clearly shown by unused rivals," Johnson said to the House Committee Committee under his investigation on the future of BBC.
If you want to hold the broadcasting fee, which I do not think of a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least not produce programs that others do or commission.
You will send The Voice in a first-class time window because you want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one would show this would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense of course.
Johnson said, "I do not see why a regressive tax finances programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arms.
I strive to see how this should be public-legislative television.
I do not think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a businessman for series, who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC blame for the hunt for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best wayto secure long-term support. "
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC give this again what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows should sell like Eastenders.
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can not measure pretty much the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they are on their hypocritical missions to justify $ 4 billionBroadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window in which no one wanted to see them.
To the broadcasting fee, Johnson said the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from it.
Of course, they all think, we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150, if that's true, because they do not consume much of theBBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-boss David Elstein, who also stated before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should check their Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now officially classify as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should be at the public television broadcasters in Australia andCanada An example take this to change in "inform, enlighten and entertain".
To the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of television are shown, and with the commercial channels alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematods change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have to be heard for human hearing too high frequencies.
The pulses operate by turning on Motoneuron cells that are genetically changed to carry the membrane channels reacting to ultrasonic waves.
Other on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, Researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said the Guardian that one day's proceedings could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that emits electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's symptoms.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani realized that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4-ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblowing and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientist to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlikelight, whichwill berevealedat anoptical fiberto the desired locationin the brainmust,low-frequencyultrasonic wavescan pass throughtissuewithout hindranceand can besentfrom the top ofthe skullinto the brain.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus is possible to temporarily prone to the meticulous human neurons for the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door!
The advertisements are shaped by Great Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Weapon Watch Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle crunching legs!
Stray bombs!
And electric shock bars that cause torment pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images no doubt that this ad is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International for the world's largest weapons fair to bring the willingness of the British government to the limelight, weapons on repressive regimes over the Defenseand Security Equipment International Jamboree in Excel Center in London's Docklands to freeze.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and requiring a second look.
"Important Announcement: Take the DLR from 15 to 18 September?"(Docklands Light Railway) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which converts to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of weapons dealers with the DLR will drive ... Customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are of artists who have issued their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 pound pack of allen keys, which is asserted that "access to around one third of the bus stop advertising space on the planetgain."
Transport for London does not find this poster "Vandalism" not funny.
One of the parody displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world outside, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works charitable with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who works for free.
VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed about the silence that prevailed for the weapon fair advertising - through a blank space of the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's give you the campaign you try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic sophisticated company advertising, but "through the influence with bright colors and animation it remains stronger."
"They made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention of the British government and the warranty that torture devices are not illegally acted in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel, where exhibitors exert fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order of the US army over "the AT4CS RS shot by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battlehead, which provides outstanding impact effects inside the target."
Whatever this causes it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student residential homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a dorm, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those who have annoyed - and to the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely frightening.
It is tempting to talk: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took a sabbath year, where they are in relation to Corbyn and why they "honestly marmites neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just oneHefe extract Hahaha, I'm in my room. "
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out people who like them in contrast to those that they would not speak, even if their eyelashes were on fire and would be these fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are wearing up and touching their underwear.
Related: Do not remember to start a relationship at the university
Introvert received a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residential homes form a room-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship going on, but you have to go away, so I get the energy back, which I have consumed for interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of sociability is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of call waiting: do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He looked a few things.
Friendship close by baking.
Since they start the university at the height of the back-mania, the knocking on the doors of people is to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950s years "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have themSomething baked. So, and now please smile when I give you a few personal questions. "
Homemade leaks offer is a great way to close friendships.
Her roommates feel obliged to talk to himself and will in the end maybe associate their face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat lead to people asleep when they call.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the claw of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check that with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my roommate that adds a detergent to your milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that they belong in the truest sense of the speaking word to the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if it makes something quieter to give it a bit quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
She reacted with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she was kindly sleeping her neighbors for another two hours before blowing her own music, climbing her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Would not it be romantic if your future spouse happens to move into the same dorm?
Conversely, it would not be due to embarrassing, if you hold a roommate for your future spouse, ran back to you, disconnect yourself again and then you have to see every day and maybe live on how to bring all the common friends to themselves?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to call your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone left his keys in his unclosed room is the border between a Ulk and bullying fine than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments until he gets to Bumerang.
Provide a valuable and amusing lesson about security through hide - but never give you someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackle your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by clicking "General" to "General" to the settings app and then select "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option for download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that communicates that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update about iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may possibly mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made that unlikely by the distraction of the update.Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone may shut down halfway and could cause it to stop the update.

Fedex result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
Fedex reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit view for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its floor transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At this time last year, Fedex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp.Said to earn a profit between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the financial year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than earlier prediction.
Analysts faced a survey of Factset $ 10.84.
Despite the price increases, the lower views, which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4th, and despite higher surcharges for land transports of heavy and large packages levied from November.
The company said that it would still expect the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and due to growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides sound yields, considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade,".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to set 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx deserved $ 692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share, just behind the $ 2.44 per share, which predicted twelve by Zacks Investment Research analysts.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion.
Fedex has recorded a decline in international priority shipment in recent years, which brought sales in its unity express shipping for stagnating.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fedex Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result was sank for higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.
On Tuesday they concluded 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11th.
On their most expected conference in the years Federal Reserve Strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table sitting to decide if it's time to raise the key interest for almost a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation in front of any other things.
The Central Bank has a two-time order from the Congress: Maximize US employment and prices here stable.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it.It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start by the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data is growing solid, the most recent turbulence on the global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarterPercentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation primarily will be the most important thing you watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if you were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification, continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which implies the financial market in itself.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the sentence unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial has jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group said.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time, "he said.
If she does it, "she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
One month ago, the Fed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals, that would require more economic progress to increase the sentence.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level, which the Fed looks at as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need it because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economics at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world suggested late last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average value fell by more than 16% in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered a bit this month, the Dow now lies nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence influences the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins at this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the Ucla Ziman Center for RealEstate and a former US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better under control.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is none of the main concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed monetary authority has become the world.
The influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the maneuver Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" their monetary expansion, confusion released around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also advise other central banks and experts to make a better understanding of theGet global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art as science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the company's asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that seem to be linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de deals with an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to reduce their key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited recognizable impact on growth in the US", Lacker said.
One year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts undo.
The Fed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the 2008 market breakup, Adam S. Posen said, former member of the Committee for Interest Control of the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence does not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest, because the markets get upset," Posen said, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not believe that they should precede the time.

Brazil's pediatric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization Sprs tries to clarify women on shocking ways, how important good diet is during breastfeeding.She does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with deposits of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies to all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to make mothers.
A recent study under the direction of Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine, to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report to the loss of Liberals leadership, but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, put in London as part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed no role to play for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved averaging 397,000 spectators at the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached averaging 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise is at an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winch of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are ok, thanks for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Serial Star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama over a recently widened father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the rafers Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strongly at 1.136 million spectators and slammed the block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17.30) The new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe gave average 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 hours to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour from The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat average 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will vote Nine confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that did not manage to outstrip the McGuires Show.

The last three votes coincide: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose?
Secret reveals?...
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may disclose unknowingly who win the Bachelor.
The woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was wrapped in great secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if they are the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Javons Fellows a day before three two, they may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips to the final on Thursday firmly sealed
All three women have laid out in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you do not, who should get Woods last rose?", They could become their answers to the game verder who won the heart of the bachelor.
JEAVONS Fellows and Markoski quickly called themselves - besides themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies noticed, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it's so fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair.
From their point of view, Mackay said that the home visit made her clearly last week that Wood "the one" could be.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I am now unconditionally set to him," she said.
And when she was asked to choose Wood, if not she, she was puzzling.
"I do not know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30 clock.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a scramble as the Aussie rugby league convert at his first Punt Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a Punt Return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies from the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged her.
Tomsula also raised Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er Sport Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missing catch and to take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Patzt at a Punt, who was restored in the first game quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start to hope for Hayne and its massive Australian followers for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2Dayfm 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the carver with his origin debut at that time in 2007 as a passport in his own in-goal area to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.

4 people killed after policemen shooting rubber poses on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in the southern Nepal, after the police shot a rubber posse into a crowd that demonstrated against the suggested new constitution, a civil servant said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before backing on rubber poses.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber poses used, known to kill them, which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal Southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed in the context of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political impact.
There were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial theme in Nepal, which has been centrally governed century.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake, which had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators have coordinated this week about certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
NHC presents 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verdish Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide gravure printing system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Capverdish islands, which has a 60% chance of developing a tropical hurricane over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravure printing system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verde islands and the small antillen also has a 60% potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, added the weather operators stationed in Miami.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc (Googl. O) announced a doubling donation campaign, which is to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations, which should help thousands of refugees that have rolled out European nations, as they flee from war torn and depleted countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of making a manager's announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who has fled to her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, about her personal experiences.
"To our journey many dark rail and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear, belonged," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family desperately look for help.
Donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save The Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations can be doubled to $ 11 million up to a value of 5.5 million on Google.com/RefugeeLief.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, who has distributed more than 4 million people this year.
Many flee from the war-shattered Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years.
It's still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data requires a long time to show something," Dr.Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery writing an editorial to the new study in Jama Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to accommodate food.
Over the years, obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed in humans who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.USA.GOV/1D0ZQDV.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - gastricpass and gastric hose - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humanswho were slightly overweight.
The average BMI under those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained at those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing a surgical procedure, 36% dissolved the diabetes disease completely and partly at 28%.
In the medical-treated group, the diabetes solved completely only at one percent and partly with only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1C, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1C is best kept below 7 percent, write researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1C level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable about 8 percent.
But these better "glycemic control" - as they reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1C level - did not decrease mortality in five years, according to the senior researchers Dr.Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger decreases in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1C (3,1% vs. 2.1%) and rather recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are hints from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, at obese people undergoing an obesity surgery, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival at the surgery patients, Blackstone said, it was reassuring for persons with a BMI below 35, which are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without the risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as you have accumulated these genetic changes that firmly connected your bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East lounger.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader asked to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to tackle the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created," he stressed.
Ultimately, we have to think about how the killing is reduced in its countries.
We have to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent US reaction took a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him the way to solve this problem is in nonviolence.
"I know his motifs were good, but he put violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Quadruple increase of taking hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Gift control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow highly alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr.Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, rose the cases of revenue from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years, which report poison control centers, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more common to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them ends up in the emergency room," said Lopez Cnn.
He said that some children of disinfectants deliberately drink while some do to impress their friends or because of a courage of social media.
Show videos on Youtube, as youthful disinfectants only drink because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of the disinfectant.
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are perfumed.
There is disinfectant with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, which are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in small children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr.Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Giftnotrufzentrum in the Hospital of the University of Kansas, the station Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let hugs be around whiskey, but people leave this hand-disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come from it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently taken four splashes of strawberry fragrant hand disinfectant at school, was brought into an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies as a drunk in an adult, Dr.Chris Ritchey, an emergency department doctor treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah lulled her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had encountered his head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfection wipes and store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after the swallowing of handshakes containing a toxic, non-declared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was noted as active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by adding antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them out of their room.
The police looked at the thermosted plan as a "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school board.

Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was 5.5 percent above the UKS of 5.5 percent, as the numbers of the office for national statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented the latest figures and said, "The long-term government plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish job market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Why I'll witness an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the Gifts injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January over his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day moved closer, I started to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since often more applications are available as places, a maceable lottery will take place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Who is selected, it will observe it emotionless.
I can not do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossipsen's tight friend, with which I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh much when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist, so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She acknowledged that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it even if he would do it.
I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go back to all details here.
I can not say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of the murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I can not claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters that you can turn to it.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man's unnecessary death.
Man after damp police chase persuasive to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale Polizoon remained dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to departure the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters from a police officer who tried to "persuade him gently to return to the shore."
The police of CANNING VALE was called on Tuesday to a trend breakage incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he did not come too far.
"He stood in the water and said I do not come out, come and get me," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he turned on a more reliable tactic - "a good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do fun things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but themselves inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spine him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria stewards have tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to stop the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a racing day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do that, which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris he can not explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say, and I sat for a long time, but sometimes they are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to walk around the main way, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If you start thinking, I do not do that, then I should not be more coaches.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had highlighted the bomb in an interview with Racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spine its stable.
"Eighteen months sitting Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. med. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I'll name, when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I insideMy stables do, deliver, "Moody said to Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a scamming.
If that's the case, you should certainly believe your noses because you have failed to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, Current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should this make me think that it will be personally?
Did the RVL behave fleeing and perhaps responsible for people outside of coaches what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people think outside that I am.
Maybe you have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say, you can think about it now.
But now I arrived at the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will do the pressure on you and urge you to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led he said that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by its preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or tone had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the racing racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It could have been the same last night.
It could be like that yesterday the whole day, which was like that.
But it also had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day.An investigation of this affair has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.

Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy beats back rivals for allegations to ring fights
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling of his players as "Agenda setting" of two Premier League Favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "Ringkämpfe" with his team during the High Storm Victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night.He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland are not "too good" in rings.
Bellamy defended the Tacklarg of his team and said that they were only focused on tackling on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches at his team confident him confident him, as it meant that she was worried to be beaten by the Storm team.
"This is coming up again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson spoke about ring fights as she beat us 24: 2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year.But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided the trendy for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train.He is probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is already funny, as this always appears at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea from "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George IllaWarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting her game was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that St. George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we look as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like them.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably did not think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I have not looked at it yet, but what was the result?16: 12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks make and no points more exciting?
For me it's the game schedules.
If you mention us, it means that we will meet you at a phase.
The Storm team released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the forfinals in Aami Park.Ticket sales starts from next Tuesday morning.
Serber with $ 200,000 deposit after drug accusation
A man who may be a lifelong punishment threatens because of his experiment to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and stood in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly lifelike punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the total amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was worried about the rivaling hazard at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he explained to the court on Wednesday.
At the criminal matter he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve its release.
"After reading the affidavit's explanations of the two persons, it is clear that the support of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Richter Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him, he did not warn.
Maksimovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he releases his Australian and his Serbian passport, reported to the police daily and holds on an outgoing lock of 18: 00-06: 00.
Stevan Hogg used girl phone to curlpen pedophiles for sending pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "respective" web research, which used concepts for the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed against the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the internet" and he then "praised to be a policeman to scare them".

Hogg was granted in this case deposit, but was held in custody due to hearings on other still outstanding cases.
He was taken before the date of the judgment in the list of sexual offenders.

Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will divide into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service business activities.
Expected job reduction leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said MEG Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, which is to direct the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deepened portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on the deployment of unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for companies," says a statement by the company.

The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is convinced that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates have to stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized Wilshere, that it was only September and unless his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history, his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had greatly finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old momentum during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in conjunction with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be made of purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider image for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have recorded most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury ratio will last during the last season.
"Sometimes, when they come back from an injury, they have a vulnerable period of time, a time in which they need to strengthen their body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he is going through a career of the species he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger introduces a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to treat the players who need a small breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites, by Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign has been launched last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with 3.2 measured on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teachings from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club with his management to his first European Cup Triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other side I am a long enough business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
FriendsFest: The comedy show, which gives us serious lessons about men's friends
The lack of similar representations in shows is obviously, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever has ever become, as suicidaries prove under young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains more common in men than women than women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a miserable life) in 2015 announced as the year of the man, with the aim of asking the culture, which hinders men from looking for helpIf you need them.
Friendship is the centerpiece in the fight to master this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.
In the age of the communication led by social media, with its focus on style on substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has the need to seep strong, lifelong and successful, doubles, even if the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values;Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our internal longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much deeper.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained money, luck really can not buy.
The beautiful at Friends was that this focus was on his head.
Every character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football look in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely relate themselves, even if they often hold back, completely their feelingsto explore.
Like an employee of the telephony care I explained: ... "My auditor's roll for people who feel depressed and are suicidal, I really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I'll come up with it" has a tremendous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems open. "
Friends is one of the shows that me comes to mind when I try to offer long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friends.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of desperation, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit Comedy Central Friendsfest this weekend with the backdrop designed to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone around someone in Starbucks, give him a smile and tell them hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move past Malmo.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player, who launched the French master, but then they missed a series of opportunities before they finally raised their lead as Cavani in the 61.Minute scored a header goal.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they do not just strive for the qualification for the K.Or.-rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while she got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate.He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start to win 2: 0, to get our opposed problems and relax our opponents, even if there are certain things we doThe season still needs to perfection, "Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I'm sure we did not get one or two more goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend was a 2-2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was stuck in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing runmer was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why when he fell into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defensebefore he graduated from Johan Willand nicely in the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would score a big victory, which was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic hit a play-off to reach this level, stepped on on the field with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in midfield a heavy opponent.
But except a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, which passes far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some miscalcids and bad degrees, not least of Ibrahimovic, who had no fewer than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, which di Maria turned into a swell shot, which was passed by Willand in the 52 minutes by the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hourly brand thanks to Cavani.The Uruguayer achieved his sixth goal this season after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmo could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention of the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, the final result could hold low before replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi was a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Haride, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, which has not the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hat off before Paris!
It was a great game of you!

Matt Damon plays a variety in filmmakfen
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she will not be needed behind the scenes.
During a sequence of Sunday Night from HBOS Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted, as it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it in the occupation of the movie and not in the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted unbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", as the commentary of the actor of the Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People sat for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film;Damon replied that her director "in the end could give us something we do not want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter users MR Pooni pushed his rage over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's so white that it hurts".
The Tweet deserved more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since its publication.
Damons Comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Movement Black Lives Matter achieved a nationwide effect and urged legislators and authorities to provide discriminatory practices against colored stopping.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.

'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climbers and service assistance Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the great price of 1 million $ home.
The competition show, which just completed her 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all levels of his obstacle course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, until the final.
To the last task, climbing belonged to a 75-foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten ended the task within the time, which he was the first athlete, who completed the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior.However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, which made him winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock about winning the great price of $ 1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E!About his pile of money.
So suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown.
The senior producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to end the course, does not receive any prize money.
After the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changing life, he receives the great gratification.
I do not think he's about some grudge.
He is just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
