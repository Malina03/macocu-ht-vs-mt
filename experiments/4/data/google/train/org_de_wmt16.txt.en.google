Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The relationship between the two has deteriorated further as a result of the deal Obama promoted for the Iranian nuclear program.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, who had declined a meeting with reference to the upcoming elections in Israel.
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential complex is here in Hobookenweg - with a view over the North Sea tidal flats.
On the street, one square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows the special locations in which a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student apartment in Munich is not really low.
In contrast to Germany's top places to live, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros for nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But well, if you can afford it...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - and then it worked.
A confident start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the cauldron of Piraeus.
Coach Pep Guardiola's team won their opening game in the Champions League at Greek record champions Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's brace (52'/90'+2) and Götze's goal (89') deservedly 3-0 (0-0).
The twelfth start success in a row should be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the handle pot to Munich in the third attempt.
When he scored his 28th goal in the Champions League to put Bayern ahead, Müller received friendly assistance from Olympiacos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed the world champion's shot that was intended as a cross to pass.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 passionate fans - and Bayern kept their word.
They showed a focused and engaged performance without shining.
Piraeus had won its most recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went bold, but were often unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
Attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Braunschweig player Omar Elabdelloui.
Müller was luckier from the right when his cross from the right half-field landed in the top left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion missed the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half.
First, when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown knocked the Pole's header off the line (26').
Then by direct acceptance, which goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35th).
Although Bayern played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set pinpricks.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable.
For example, when he deflected a shot from Ideye over the bar (56th).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a back four defended with David Alaba in the center alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer on “Sky”: “Anyone who wants to make something else out of it is malicious”.
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the ailing Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came on late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller added a penalty with a penalty.
Before the game, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a small group of partially masked Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with batons.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported from the stadium.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news: If you do without, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees from the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
The DIfE emphasizes that the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums.
The authors emphasize that smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smokers, explained lead author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE: "Smoking shortens lifespan."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are edentulous, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists come across remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have once again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Romano-Germanic Museum have dug up skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called archaeological monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always consulted as the specialist agency for the preservation of archaeological monuments.
The archaeologists have now found what they were looking for in the third construction phase of the Rheinboulevard.
Trier explained that it was already known from text documents that there was a fortress on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman hit by freight train
After a young woman had an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Linden, the federal police asked the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the federal police, she suffered serious injuries when the train was captured.
She received emergency medical treatment at the scene and was taken to hospital by paramedics.
The investigating officers have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman crossing the tracks at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or local residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information that provides information about the cause of the accident can be given on the round-the-clock, free Federal Police hotline on 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more similar to traditional courts in terms of its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede plans to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow appeals against judgments.
So far, those involved in the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
According to her own statements, she wants to work towards an international investment court in the long term.
Disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be clarified there, for example.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) demanded by large corporations in particular are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional courts of arbitration have been criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system that companies can use to claim damages from taxpayers, undermine national laws or enforce lowering of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Economics Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission is taking into account key points that Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the legal options for business through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized companies in particular could be disadvantaged as a result, it said.
It was still unclear on Wednesday when talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement could be concluded.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
A framework for the agreement was originally supposed to be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered tenable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on the stage in Cologne's Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven's presentation.
Using various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, he tells the story of what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear that are harmonically very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into great opulence at any time.
The rumor spreads that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung about in a row.
But "Seven Swans" was already released in 2004 and near the Rhine and positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens appears reduced here.
Guitar and banjo are enough for him live.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") was released in 2005, a masterpiece that was celebrated across the board.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing from any of the influential music media's best-of-the-year lists.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic elements on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This decent sixth studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and reverberations.
Long gone from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here are a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring through Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
Theater he mainly presents "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting spellbound in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play their way through the broadly enriched album.
One hears from the audience: the lecture is "more opulent" and one could "basically throw away the record".
Stevens only modestly thanks for an encore, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Ridiculous 21 years young, a linnet with a very chic hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is worth 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Pole has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where her idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in abundance in Szczecin since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
If any.
She says: "Actually, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade at high school."
"I'll fulfill her dream".
compulsory education?
Who cares?
The fans don't.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He's taken care of anyway.
He earned three million for advertising during the Super Bowl commercial break, and a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company brought many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And for every doll that looks like him that goes over the counter, Bieber cashes in, too.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, people are amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype has gone too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What Do You Mean?" in 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he pretends so.
Pegida poster gives Lebanese idea of potato kebabs
Potatoes or doner kebab?
Both are possible - in the potato kebab that the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the slogan "Potatoes instead of doner kebabs" on a Pegida movement poster, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of doner kebabs," which he happened to see on television, gave him the idea.
Since then, a spit with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop.
"It's multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea with the patent office in Munich.
According to the authorities, it has recently been protected there as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by his customers.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for beach holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: The water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees at the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Aich/Dob officials on trial for breach of trust
At the regional court in Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball runners-up Aich/Dob had to answer for breach of trust and tax evasion on Wednesday.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to senior public prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the accused used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to use in their functions, for private purposes.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was ruled out by the chair of the jury panel, judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
Regarding the rejection of infidelity, the defense argued that the association had never suffered a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials only charged expense allowances and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 schillings (approx. 44,000 euros) .
"At that time we were faced with the situation: should we continue the club or should we close it?" said one of the accused, a day job as a large-scale auditor for the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We advanced money and put our life insurance at the bank as security," he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: You can freely manage the money, only no debts may be incurred.
Furthermore, the payment of the expense allowances retrospectively to 1991 was decided - with corresponding financial success.
Therefore, part of the expense allowances were only paid out years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
That's why flat-rate and not detailed debits appeared, explained the former chairman of the processes.
The two defendants managed the accounts and savings books together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of financial management, only being debt-free was important, so the answer.
When investigations into abuse of office began against one official in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association's account.
Those were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account was in the name of the second accused and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The interviewee had no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed it was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known about this money, the prosecutor pointed out.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage compensation".
Why compensation? the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says: "You're all off the hook with him".
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The functionary also said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only charged mileage allowance and diets.
He billed the club 1,000 euros a month for diets, but the actual expenditure was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not produce precise documents for the early years.
After an audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, these were no longer kept, they explained.
The second accused had also received mileage allowance.
All payments were made in cash, so he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the downsizing that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut more jobs when the company is split up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not coming to an end.
The US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division as part of its restructuring.
This should save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The job cuts of 55,000 that have been going on for three years have not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 fiscal year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent in after-hours trading.
The group from Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo was recently hit by disappointing PC sales again and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services.
In the third fiscal quarter ending July, PC and printer sales fell 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenue fell in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, was slow to respond to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans envisage a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, meet with overwhelming rejection: 54 percent spoke out against it, 35 percent said they agreed.
61 percent find it positive that other states are flying airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Fifty-one percent of respondents reject working with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, while 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not decide.
Auto: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair until September 27th will be connected, self-driving cars and electromobility.
After two days of press, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
Like two years ago, the organizers from the VDA car association are expecting around 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported over the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind them and a water cannon was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
The officers used pepper spray at first.
After that, the police used tear gas.
Much tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
With that, the group was disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is reorganizing the group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with better organization alone.
The restructuring of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is reorganizing its corporate structure and upgrading the low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board member responsible for passenger business at Lufthansa.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board of directors around boss Carsten Spohr.
With the realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the pilots' association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the strike was stopped by the court.
This was announced by the union.
The subject of the talks is said to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a forecast record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision for the pilots, the background is the "Wings" savings concept.
It provides that Lufthansa outsources routes to the group's own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who don't have much money in the central Franconian town of Eckental.
For example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living space, but also single mothers and low earners."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner thinks he knows how quickly cheap living space can be created: in a project he is building terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be entering the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums is not sustainable.
Because most of the people stay here.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient living space in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you house people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each.
Each residential unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, not including the land.
That's manageable.
Construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have building codes complicated your plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I went through my project correctly.
The threatening sword of Damocles special construction and the parking space ordinance always make it particularly complicated.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities there is not enough space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to your terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true: We've had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
It's all about this.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
Rosberg's only motto: full attack
In the fight for the world title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg only knows one motto: "Full attack".
Before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, the World Championship runner-up emphasized "that I have nothing left to lose".
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday, 53 points separate the vice world champion from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Brit has already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and is also the favorite to tackle the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state.
The 30-year-old Briton won the race in 2009 and last year.
It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix.
A haze has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has one prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for a cure.
Gauselmann bears the Federal Cross of Merit, 1st class, and is an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to admit chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the "Rot-Weiss" tennis club will be seen as an expression of his connection to the spa town.
The district office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift old people's center have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation is drawn down from the mountain to the city center.
To be more precise, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new neighborhood office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the supermarket, senior citizens and those seeking advice can now get information on questions such as long-term care insurance or the benefits of health and long-term care insurance.
With our outpatient nursing service, we have noticed for years that caring relatives are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"It is also not uncommon for many health insurance services not to be used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood anymore," explained the new landlady Jutta Weigand, who, as division manager for the elderly, is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus " responsible for.
In addition to advice, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis ideally complement each other.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and nursing," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see demographic change as the reason for opening the new district office in the city centre.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social get-together".
In this way, the social foundation makes a major contribution to seniors being able to live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings as possible.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus is losing an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
From 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and director of institutes.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Design Institute.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at the police officer
Ex-soccer player Tim Wiese was not noticed well in Bremen.
Once upon a time there was a footballer, now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not increased.
Wiese was having his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking lot attendant issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the fine at her feet, as reported by the "Bild" newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still being examined," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for marijuana plants to thrive.
For the past three days, Panamanian authorities have been uprooting and burning the 4,500 plants.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses to an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called out to them to wait for him.
At this time the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the gas station premises.
One of these men yelled at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding profusely from the nose.
When his two friends rushed over and talked soothingly to the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and demonstratively drove past there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male.
The victim's face and thighs were beaten with a baton.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second thug is said to have been around 1.65 meters tall and was wearing jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
dr Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Bernd Bormann, mayor of the joint municipality, Uta Seim-Schwartz, business promoter, and Asendorf's mayor, Heinfried Kabbert, are also happy about this.
In many places in the countryside there are no doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller left the Felstehausen practice on October 1st.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will support his successor with a part-time job for the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on October 12. Until then, he will have invested 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and also wants to start working in the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time came, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees being his own boss as an advantage.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, father of two, also grew up there. After studying medicine in Hanover, he worked in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed head emergency physician in the Diepholz district and is a volunteer in the DRK on-call service in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to establish themselves as general practitioners.
"That's why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more consulting room.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a subsidy totaling EUR 50,000 as part of a support program from the district (EUR 25,000) as well as from the joint municipality (EUR 12,500) and the municipality (EUR 12,500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," emphasizes joint municipality mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, compared to around 500 in the average practice in northern Germany.
There is another general practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller taking over the practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's office hours will continue to see familiar faces in particular: they will take over the seven medical assistants and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She already feels a little nostalgia after such a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients more often," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6,000 square meter property."
"So far I've always avoided gardening, but now that could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also being ramped up on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will remain in place at the same time.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The care and safety of people is the priority.
But it is also clear "that clear signals are needed," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to continue their journey towards Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also wanted to build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not see it that way.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will in fact intensify the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenia does not want to seal off its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," stressed Györkos Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing during the night on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, since then.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action.
In the coming days, his country is expecting around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was their job to instruct people to take certain routes: "We neither can nor want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, the first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid early in the morning, and more buses are expected during the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could now actually result in the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a route a little further west, as already predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive options for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give any details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently given the country good marks in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to media reports in Belgrade, they spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm people down during a local inspection in Horgos on Wednesday morning: He considers the debates about alternative routes for refugees to be premature now that the Hungarian border is closed.
The number of refugees would not be very high at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started distributing maps to the refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not without its dangers: in parts of the border area there are still minefields that have not been cleared, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a demining team had been dispatched to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is believed to be part of a cybercriminal ring accused of hacking unpublished financial reports and press releases from websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider deals are said to have been made on the financial markets with the information stolen.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were stolen in this way.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders are eventually caught," the SEC statement said.
The trials of 32 other suspects in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the USA and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People go about their errands, sometimes at a brisk pace, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You head for the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon on Paradeplatz.
light rail stop.
Vibrant, full life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it all four large panels each with the heading "I want to die before I die"....
With this campaign, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid draws attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people with the campaign," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions, as are the volunteers.
While many a passer-by spontaneously grabs a piece of chalk and adds "affirm my life", "be able to read", "drive a camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "don't suffer long", others stop for a moment , read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then move on.
Small discussions about the action itself, about life, about dealing with dying, keep developing on the sidelines.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which, together with the Caritas Association, is the sponsor of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this high-profile campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in particular has contributed a lot in recent years to people opening up.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and bereavement attendant is one of the voluntary employees from the very beginning.
Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, she immediately got in touch and was there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who support those affected and their families in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Saint Vincent hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is good at her job and the experiences she has made.
"I see life from a different perspective, I think it's precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enable the training and further education and supervision of the death and bereavement attendants.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the Evangelical Church building (M1, 1a) and in the Catholic Church building (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who selflessly support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even at the age of 74, she still enjoys teaching.
She does it every Thursday in the home for asylum seekers on Dillinger Strasse.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different from teaching at a real school.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar systems.
The planning for the long-awaited construction of the gymnasium at the Bernried sports grounds is progressing step by step: at the most recent municipal council meeting, the planning application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The committee had previously decided, among other things, to apply for an "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan under building law.
The "exception" was about permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with a non-central ridge and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background to the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south-facing roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to what is stipulated in the development plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "exemption" was necessary because the development plan does not allow any "exceptions" with regard to the pitch of the roof - although the Bernried municipal council is generally rather restrictive when it comes to applications for exemption.
However, the construction of the gym is not a recurring project: "We are not creating a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The construction of the gymnasium at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The costs are around 2.3 million euros.
Subsidies are expected from school and mass sports funding.
In the next step of the process, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and most of the employees are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the district hospital GmbH, which district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiss confirmed.
However, the supervisory board will make a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, September 23rd.
If the plans are implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiss, employees who cannot come to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees have been informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When it came to the question of who should succeed him, according to Jochner-Weiss, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take over the management from October 1st and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiss.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the inner ward.
If the supervisory board agrees, Fischer and his team will run both houses temporarily for the next two years, until next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years .
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation of the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
District Administrator Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chair of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Miners' Association, is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"I rule that out". Jochner-Weiß could not say how the property would continue, there were several considerations.
Short-term care from Caritas and day psychiatry are currently housed there.
"Nothing better could have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," says Fischer about the virtual move to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (8.15 p.m.) at the Bergisches HC.
The leaders of the Bundesliga are the clear favorites in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
Several hunters were in action during the harvest in a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), the police said.
After a shot was fired, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
It was initially unclear how exactly the accident could have happened.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victim of violent crime
A suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenager and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who reportedly confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location where the body was found.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed the night before after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, investigators first found the victim's personal belongings.
When questioning friends and acquaintances of the missing person, there was a suspicion that the 20-year-old had committed a crime.
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted to the police questioning that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought before the magistrate on Wednesday, and investigators charged him with manslaughter.
Further investigations should shed light on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing shortage
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are crowding into a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year until 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing Construction" alliance.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in an initial reception center as asylum seekers.
Many then come across the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in rented accommodation last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany has a housing deficit that is getting bigger every year.
Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains that around 770,000 residential units are currently missing in the metropolitan areas.
Many working people therefore had to live in shared apartments in big cities.
Due to the slump in the housing market, young adults involuntarily stayed longer in "Hotel Mama".
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "social housing" alliance proposes a new start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing construction again.
For example, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the real estate tax for subsidized apartments could be suspended for a limited period.
According to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are also necessary.
The support program for refugee accommodation from the state bank KfW is already being well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees have safe conduct: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
It is practically impossible to get through to Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighboring Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border was sealed off, hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there.
The Croatian television station RTL reports that 500 people crossed the border near Tovarnik.
Hungary had sealed off its border to refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: "You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia's border with the EU neighboring country Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by both bus and taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not come across border fences.
But the border strip harbors other dangers: there are still live mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
Hardly any refugees come to Hungary after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, there were still 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important Röszke crossing.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in the past few weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the border between Serbia and Hungary was closed, only a few refugees reached Austria.
The country has also tightened its border controls.
According to the government, around 20,000 migrants are still in the country.
Around 1,400 people are waiting in Salzburg for the onward journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, small groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance to the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau .
Before that, we fed the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks.
We said right away that we would take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
A man insisted on handing over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very happy about that," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels in order to try to cross the border after the short-notice announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been discontinued.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
Cross-border activities are generally very popular in Wernstein.
The bridge festival connected socially with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a sporty Zweibrückenlauf - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the Röszke camp that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly placed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism.
Those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas are not the only victims of this policy.
Refugees, too, will find that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is just another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the continuing stream of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception center under control.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was done without any fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states and 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a bottomless pit," said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the provincial governors.
They had assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"Things are going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to find out how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations of the ORF campaign "Helfen wie wir".
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need, it cannot be the case that accommodation providers have to maintain a certain height for the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a limited time.
Konrad uses his experience to justify the fact that, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in finding accommodation.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told an untruth to his face.
The power of persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three or four.
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
But apparently there are problems with the permit.
Linz demands a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment because the people affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, other locations should be checked for their suitability.
The mayor criticizes the distribution of the refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on how to proceed with the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany on regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is, for Pühringer, "a logical consequence" of the actions taken by the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in Linz's Industriezeile is officially complete.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the bright minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies at Neue Werft and acquiring some later.
S&T wanted to cooperate with its new neighbors right from the start - which Niederhauser has high hopes for: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the location, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which is owned by the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG) one third each.
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2,700 square meters of space in the building have already been rented, and there are inquiries for a further 40 percent.
Lia Peroni owner opened a second shop in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project without further ado: After all, she has now grown in the form of another shop.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags from the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously it was remodeled several weeks.
"But I thought long and hard about opening another shop," says Breit.
One of the decisive factors in the decision was that the Furla producers, who are based in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of having their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit inherited her interest in fashion from her mother.
I'm best when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Even the specialist cannot answer with absolute certainty why some women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag.
Maybe it's because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's Palatinate ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-offs.
Some also associate this quality with the billionaire who wants to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he makes xenophobic comments, is rude to journalists or reveals gaps in his knowledge of international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency stirs up the election campaign.
And does well at it.
This is also registered in Kallstadt, Palatinate, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the blow-dried hairstyle is well known to many in the wine-growing village on the Wine Route.
Some people in the 1,200-inhabitant town are related to him over umpteen corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstadt resident Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it exciting in a way, but aren't that deeply impressed in their Kallstadt way," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, she made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which include Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't make it there to become the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the family's achievements, there is also a tendency for the opinion that Trump is "a bit of a loudmouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has around is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of braggarts.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when his future grandfather emigrated and opened a bar for gold diggers in the USA.
The cornerstone of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return home permanently failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
The director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, said at the start of the film that he didn't include Trump because he once ran away without permission.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he rumbles, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandmother was born Trump, grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distantly, "he's always so short-tempered".
Does he think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadt residents, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
She thinks it would be better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's a good thing".
If those who ruled the United States in his grandfather's day were like him, "he would never have gotten there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says vintner's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed at length, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also growing in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village".
The village of 1,800 in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism from the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
There are already 20 "Mountaineering Villages" in Austria.
In the neighboring country, the local Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Because of the high number of refugees, the Free Voters are demanding that 1,000 new teachers be hired in Bavaria.
At the beginning of the FW autumn retreat in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools if there weren't new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapsing to preserve," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of free voters meets in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voters' meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will supersede the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, like those that existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"It can't go on like this, we have to look at the causes," said the Free Voters boss.
The Free Voters want to deport rejected asylum seekers as quickly as possible.
That's why Aiwanger called for more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticized the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bayern deports, others don't."
"We have to become more capable of acting."
But state politics in Großwallstadt should not be neglected.
A long-running issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
At the start of the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot project "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the middle school level from three to four years is being tested - as a result it then takes nine years again to graduate from high school.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free travel with the G9 wherever you want it.
Firmer Wall Street helps Dax along
After largely directionless and nervous trading, the German stock market closed with profits.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start on the US stock exchanges ensure a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax for medium-sized stocks gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.

The trading centers in London and Paris also posted solid gains.
In the US, the Dow Jones index was recently up around 1 percent.
Many stockbrokers expect that the markets will stand still until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also for the great fall on the futures exchanges this Friday.
The discussion about the burden of the nuclear phase-out has meanwhile pushed RWE shares to a record low and also left deep marks on Eon.
According to "Spiegel", the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions.
The federal government denied the figures given in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
According to a trader, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" over the weekend had an impact.
Accordingly, investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car stocks were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen preferences increased in price by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the current yield of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro fell in the afternoon to 1.1262 dollars.
Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
Building area planned in the city
The site at the Emden youth center Alte Post is to be built on again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of retail, commercial and residential is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4,000 square meter plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth center.
The preparations for this are currently underway.
The plan is to use the site for a mix of retail, commercial and residential use.
According to the city, the company is waiting for corresponding offers.
Which investors come into question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
A few months ago, the city of Emden bought part of the property on the corner of Ringstraße and Große Straße and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home complex on the Kleinen Meer near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
A number of residents are still worried - they fear that their leisure retreat will be sold out
For months, negotiations, brooding, debates and drawings had taken place behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home complex on the Kleinen Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emden company "System-Bau", presented its plans to the city development committee of the Emden Council for the first time on Monday evening.
Originally, this item was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, who accused the investors and the administration of keeping secrets, Ralf Behrends from the System-Bau management went on the offensive: "We still don't have an answer to all the questions," he told the audience Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to counter all rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction provoked violent reactions among sea shack owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, sea shack owner and board member of the residents' interest group, Pro Hieve, complains: "It's going to be a giant block that towers over all the other buildings."
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase significantly due to the intended size of the system: "There have to be whole busloads for it to pay off," says Schulz
However, what exactly will happen on the one-hectare site of the former restaurant is still unclear.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twin offspring in gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about the offspring of its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined as their mother Dian has been holding them close to their bodies.
First the "image" had reported.
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It's a topic that's getting more attention in fiction these days: A young woman who was unpopular and unsightly when she was at school meets her childhood crush years later, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recently published novel "Actually we are not like that" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be of particular interest to readers from the Hunsrück region, as it takes place in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to erect a literary monument to her home town.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the Querspange between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the Querspange in the direction of the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The police said the vehicles involved in the accident suffered property damage of around 10,000 euros.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer drivable and had to be towed away.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
The officers were only able to take the troublemakers into custody with the use of pepper spray.
A breath alcohol test showed a 16-year-old to be 0.89 per mille.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had a blood alcohol level of 2.15 and initially remained in custody.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: the driver's cab tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a rear-end collision involving three trucks on Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, the police said.
The cab of the driver who caused the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked for over six hours until 2 a.m.
There was damage of 122,000 euros.
Smugglers use small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the federal police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been apprehended along the border river Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and weirs.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
According to the federal police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
A spokesman said in the morning that around 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1,759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of gusts of wind in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced that warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe.
The strong low is the foothills of tropical storm Henry, which has moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in the past few days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can also be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun will be longer again.
It's the crowd that counts: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was a lot of movement in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particularly high demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days September 17th to 27th).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new full-size and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in dealerships in the fall.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
So that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in prospect, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
The Hessians also offer other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
The station wagon, which can already be seen at the IAA, will follow in the spring as the second variant.
And what other new compact cars will be on display alongside the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and a decidedly sporty GT version.
It will go on sale early next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand's design line.
The base model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Sales of the Baleno will start in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: The compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA, is not entirely new, but completely renewed.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot put their hands on the front end in particular: the radiator grille was redesigned here and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system in particular has been modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, there will be a number of revisions and new variants in the compact class at the IAA, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters cell is inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of an ex-prisoner at Tegel Prison who was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they have only been locked in the cramped rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: Between June and November 2009 he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
The man, who according to his lawyer is now free again, was then transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit against the state of Berlin because of the unworthy prison conditions failed.
But the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal and sent the case back there for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of men violated.
The Court of Appeal will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question are relevant for compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "an atrophy of the legal protection of the personality would have to be feared".
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the monetary compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of convicts.
It was only in April that they awarded a prisoner damages because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
On Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 as inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff at the time was held in a cell similar to the one in the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also made the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have broken out because of the tense situation.
According to information from the judicial press office, 21 positions in Tegel are vacant due to a lack of young talent, and 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's in store for Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year. According to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we can do it".
The following overview gives an overview of what is to come in Germany.
According to various forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate by the Federal Building Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate by the Pestel Institute) apartments will be needed every year - for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
The lack of living space is particularly dramatic when it comes to affordable rental properties: Every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units are no longer subject to rent control, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be built every year and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany will be able to work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, the decisive factor for the integration of refugees is whether they can find work in Germany.
According to migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt, work is the key to social contacts, to being valued in the receiving society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from a ban on refugees working to recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the view has prevailed that refugees should be given faster access to the labor market.
A major hurdle for access to the job market is a lack of German language skills.
So far there has not been a sufficient range of general and job-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
In Thränhardt's view, the development of networks is therefore the silver bullet for work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to day care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for young people and families in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day care center, the administration distributes leaflets in different languages.
If the need for educators increases sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the federal states, pupils without knowledge of German are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated persons from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Access to university could be made easier for refugees who are willing to study.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start studying.
The latter generally do not receive Bafög, since they do not fall under the group of people entitled to Bafög.
Until now, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for student loans. From January 1, 2016, this period will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that would take care of the newcomers in a professional manner.
Rights also include duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant it certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to resolve such conflicts in Germany "immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany," he said on Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more of an issue for society as a whole than it is today.
This means that the majority of society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series of murders showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for everyone: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for example good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"In terms of manpower and capacities, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system for this.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be given health cards as soon as they register.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to fobbe off so many people with the limited catalog of benefits provided for by the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the language barriers are the main problem for the doctors.
The Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
She demands that interpreter costs not only have to be covered in clinics, but also in medical practices.
Many refugees would have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency departments.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
According to Montgomery, German doctors can handle the sometimes different clinical pictures because of their training.
"Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even provide relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take another examination.
According to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatized.
Anyone suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, tachycardia and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe jumpiness and emotional numbness.
Early treatment is necessary to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new "Passion" production, Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the arena on the Ziegelwasen.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior director.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current arena production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm runs in the blood of the family.
"It's important to us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them with us into a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior manager.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept "ring cocktail with cosmopolitan flair".
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also know their craft.
The Cuban duo wants to easily take on the heroes of silent films.
Lightness and flexibility - they identify with these words.
Her humorous art on the mast should take women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous laughter salvos, Circus Probst's acrobatics also fascinate with their sensitivity and agility.
Balancing on a sphere with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Contortionists fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with her flexibility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the keeping of circus animals are all too often a topic for various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, anticipate every wish as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go into the ring.
So the top priority is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid may not be ready for the ring yet, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "It doesn't matter whether there are five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly involved".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17th to 20th September every day at 5pm and 8pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, the prices for the performance at 5 p.m. are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
Borrowed a 440 hp sports car and wrecked it
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
Then came the rude awakening on the rain-soaked Autobahn.
With a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
A 29-year-old from the district of Gotha did the same.
The dream was over on the A 71 near Arnstadt.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, skidded on the wet road and crashed into the crash barrier.
The sports car was totaled, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to Bayern Munich in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
FC Bayern was obviously about to sign Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight-time Spanish champions, three-time cup winners, four-time Champions League winners, two-time club world champions, two-time European champions, one-time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was about to leave Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we nothing," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't move
However, the change did not take place.
And the man who made the difference today works for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EURO."
"Pep told me I wouldn't leave, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern for the entire distance on the pitch, knocked out the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and finally celebrated the premier class triumph.
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Gießen regional council responsible for the initial reception, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on options for military action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collectively looking the other way".
Four years ago, people were happy that the cup of military participation passed by Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing down on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has reintroduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said talks had already taken place between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, have requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (September 22), the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to give the federal states more support in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the states, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those people who need protection will get it.
But if you don't have the prospect of staying in Germany, you can't stay in Germany either.
This view was clearly shared in the group.
The chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also fence off the border with Romania.
Unlike Serbia, this neighboring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers from looking for alternative routes via Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
A global ocean sloshes beneath the ice sheet of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Researchers conclude this from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
Accordingly, the moon tumbles slightly on its orbit around the ringed planet.
This wobbling movement is small, but still too large for a continuously solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyzes in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the Enceladus ice sheet.
In 2006, for example, "Cassini" discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon that spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn's so-called E ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
1860 Munich will have to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for around a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier in the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably a four-week compulsory break".
"That hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non-club professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Striker Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after suffering a concussion.
The Austrian national player should start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in a violent collision in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
Contrary to initial fears, he remained without a serious injury.
Not a diet fruit - Mangoes are high in sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to keep your slim figure in mind, you are often advised not to use them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support their eyesight, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When bought, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and should smell pleasant.
Skin color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can taste delicious too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as chicory and radicchio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Above all, drivers are wanted.
Last year, UPS increased its workforce by 95,000 for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking early precautions to be prepared for the holiday shopping season since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a foehn storm, then a distinctive cold front
In the coming night, the foehn will break through in the valleys on the north side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night, the foehn will blow through the foehn valleys at times at gale force.
After the end of the föhn on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front will cross us, bringing heavy rain, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong south-west current.
On the north side of the Alps, the foehn will break through the valleys on Wednesday night.
As a result, the foehn will blow in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h until Thursday morning, occasionally and especially in Urnerland sometimes with over 100 km/h.
In some places, the foehn can reach the neighboring central plateau, and hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are even possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday a stormy foehn brings summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the southern flank of the Alps is beginning to build up.
Rain sets in here and lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning the foehn will run out of air, as a result a cold front with heavy rain, sometimes with thunderstorms, will roll across Switzerland from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days will be autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
In the presence of Mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on Oppio Hill was christened in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now being honored as the "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the Working Group of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes, as a minority, were often only able to practice their faith in secret for centuries.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
As a young Augustinian monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At the time, he saw the city as a degenerate babel of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome.
With his theses against the sale of indulgences, Luther then initiated the split in the western church.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not with the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has retained his "language" with bright colors and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, it can seem quite gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles were created that deal with topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
In doing so, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today's current context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's paintings.
They are embedded between the original quotation from the Bible by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who is formulating his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The decorative binding has golden letters.
In this way, the 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul and his emotions in two ways.
That's a high level of intimacy.
Ultimately, emotions were what triggered the Bible project in the first place: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Order.
"The education used to be done with a cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I tried to work through that, so that I might get along with my father again."
His second concern is to help art regain its status in fast-moving times: "Today, the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising, and it's loud.
Symbolism is suppressed there.
Artists have a different lust and delight in showing things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In that sense, I'm a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into" the pictures, let them affect them, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture looks for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt didn't make sure to fully understand the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him and also mysterious.
"It wasn't an equal partnership," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text just explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen your life and find freedom".
For Möhler, Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track is approaching
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, mounds of earth modeled for a circuit: A year later almost everything was finished - but that was already over before the official opening of the BMX track.
Failures in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So down the hill, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for a building permit.
The first municipal councilor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce that the approval will be received in October in the children and youth committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
Work should then begin on the former indoor pool without "another commemorative break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sends a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is reacting to the escalating situation in Germany and is assuring politicians that it will help them to deal with the problems ahead.
"I think that's our country's biggest challenge since reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone must be interested in getting this issue under control," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I'll be in the chancellery next Wednesday and will meet Minister of State Ms Özoğuz and the chancellor there."
"The topic will certainly play a central role there," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But it is up to politicians to set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesliga clubs also support this program.
The 36 professional clubs are already sending a clear signal this weekend when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left shirt sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "a matter of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, nobody is allowed to look away."
"We Bundesliga clubs can, no, we have to use our charisma, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a major joint effort by German football".
It's great that all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their localities.
It's just as great that small and very small clubs are active there.
The "1-0 for a welcome" message that we put out is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection team and the federal government, is making 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
According to several reports, the CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother's house in the United States, after midnight, he fell on a glass of water that he was carrying in his left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott can go about his work.
"We will meet in Walldorf at the beginning of October before the Supervisory Board meeting," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I am fully there for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner the whole time," McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but he hasn't been to SAP's German headquarters in Walldorf since the summer.
It is important to him to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Something like this can happen to anyone."
"It's important to get up again after you fall."
McLaren backup driver Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen tweeted a related photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off his bike.
He is therefore just as out of the question as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore at the weekend, as he is at the Japanese Grand Prix a week later.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The national player will also be missing from the Bundesliga leaders in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. / Sky).
"Unfortunately we can't fall back on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
The BVB coach left open whether Reus will be back in the top Bundesliga game against Leverkusen on Sunday: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
In view of the high pressure on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his starting eleven in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolutely top level," said the soccer coach in praise of the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future.
It is very likely that he will also play the second game.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers the bold statement by teammate Reus that BVB should be aiming for the final in the Europa League to be understandable: "Marco is not so wrong about that."
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title."
Robot cars: the government wants Germany to play a pioneering role
According to the will of the federal government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show of a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
So that the driver "is not burdened with any additional liability risks", the federal government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The federal government also wants to work for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is increasingly becoming a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not to be expected until well after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros in 2025.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans are still skeptical about self-driving cars - much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra presented on Wednesday at the AA comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent do not expect it for 20 years So, 31 percent don't believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of those surveyed expect autonomous cars by 2025, in the USA 33 percent.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to relinquishing control throughout the journey on all roads.
At least 15 percent could imagine that on the freeway in flowing traffic, and 45 percent in traffic jams.
A good one in four would under no circumstances let the car take control.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis championships
According to the current status, the Düsseldorfer only wants to play individually in the title fights from September 25th to October 4th.
The final decision should be made by September 22 at the latest.
"It's a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was en route to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo it's a disadvantage, we're not such a clear favorite anymore," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The man from Hamelin, who leads the seed list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was also absent then and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by that," said the fifth in the world rankings.
Manchester United's England international Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle from Héctor Moreno and substituted after long treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a tibia fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old team-mate.
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror chamber: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look shockingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen from September 18th in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude has changed to a show about himself.
He was actually against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than just pretty clothes," said Kunsthalle director Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man, who can hardly be overseen, who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
The show is not structured chronologically, but it is an excellently choreographed total work of art that required a great deal of effort: a stylist was hired to do the hair for the dolls, for example.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
Gaultier said he was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first tentative steps towards fashion.
As a kid (he wasn't a good student and bad at football) he dressed his teddy bear in bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier said in Munich.
Of course I bought it later.
He was unable to pay the models for his first fashion show.
They received nothing, but were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelery instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
The long embroidery machines in and around Plauen used to be about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a bigger role, but was then pushed out by the home textiles industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives a few examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, forms an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not serve a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, along with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauen lace and embroidery industry association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have collapsed.
Private specialist shops and wholesalers are almost gone.
Our products hardly ever reach customers in this way.
The mass-produced goods are nowadays manufactured much more cheaply in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have had a seal of quality that shows that we produce in an ecologically and socially responsible manner".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau - in the faculty for applied arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to stand up to the competition from Asia, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
A tension is created between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process, she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old," says Reuter.
She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelery as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to do a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
It is still unclear who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and small children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt from Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "political economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that around 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold based on the current limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller non-predatory fish, such as carp, are usually so low in pollution that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that only helps the economy," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates in the food chain, particularly in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written statement from the Federal Environment Ministry to Annalena Baerbock, member of the Green Party in the Bundestag, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded", the "Spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
