Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city A mental asylum, where today young people are said to meet. A crypt chapel, where they are now digging tunnels for the S-Bahn. Allotment holders cultivate the soil of former farmers. The oldest official map of Munich brings captivating stories to light. It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date. Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that. The historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas, an offering from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date - and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative. Especially when one compares them with current online maps. Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century. The digital BayernAtlas is a patchwork quilt that one doesn't quite recognise for what it is at first. Within the large overview map, were worked in detailed maps for towns and municipalities, so-called original-lay-of-the-land sheets. According to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority, these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria. Their commissioner: Napoleon. The French army commander had occupied Bavaria since the spring in 1800, during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria. Napoleon wanted to gain an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey - naturally for military purposes. Even if the French troops finally retreated with the Treaty of Lunéville from 9th February 1801: it was the current neighbours who had the idea to create a comprehensive map of Bavaria. Elector Max IV. Joseph propelled the project further forward, founding the "Topographical Bureau" - and with that, the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority. The original lay-of-the-land sheet for Munich originates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library. The comparison of past/present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital. The city has stretched out in all directions and coalesced. An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856. Sendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created. Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city. Around 1856, Untersendling's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers' revolt against Austria in 1705. Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but field - at first sight: upon zooming in, a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record," from which the property tax was derived. Today, it is no longer farmers who occupy small parcels there - rather, it is allotment holders of the "Land in Sonne" facility. A large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling. Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still actually a "Wiese" - a meadow - and not a concrete wasteland. On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine. In the original lay-of-the-land sheet, in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is, one can make out not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "Auf der Lüften" - but can actually read in large letters "mental asylum." Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, they once imprisoned people with delusions. The Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" had come to life there in 1858/59. From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II. "He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men. What is more, he forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, leader of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been busying itself for an exhibition with the establishment. Originally there was place for 280 patients; later this was expanded to 500 places. At some point even this capacity was no longer enough - the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905. The Isar Amper Clinic, East Munich, has been located there since 2006, one of the largest psychiatric units in Germany. On the plot of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum. The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes. To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, and to the east, residential houses from the 1980s. In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" nursery was built - in the architectural style of the original mental asylum building, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks. Marienplatz was recorded as the "main square" in around 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse." The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich. The bombs of the Allies tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944. One big one remains up to this day - at the Marienhof. The English Institute, small commercial premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood in the Marienhof, where these days, preparations for the second S-Bahn main line are underway, with first digging to follow on 5th April 2017. You can use the slider control to compare the old Munich map with the aerial view from today - and to fill in the hole at the Marienhof.
Pasture fence project is fundamental The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued next year. Members of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view. Representatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm, belonging to the Schwendemann family. To start with, Markus Schwendemann gave insights into his business, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of pasture and 40 hectares of woodland, keeps 40 milk cows and just as many young stock, and accommodates five apartments of holiday makers. Schwendemann says that, for him, there is no alternative to the "Black Forest milk" marketing channel he uses for the milk from his cows. Only regional produce is served to the holiday-makers. Since he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "fundamentally important." I can't make a profit on that kind of steep-sloping ground. Grassland areas make for a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the string trimmer. "We have to grapple with the conditions and with the topography here," stressed Schwendemann. In 2003, he took over his parents' business and he manages this without chemical crop protection and fertilisers, even if it's not an organic farm that he's running. For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that "the community has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy to have the Leader funding." The farmers need support to the tune of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare. One hopes that with that, afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while. "The biggest asset that we have are the people who work in agriculture and who give thought to how to bring their businesses forward," stressed the mayor. The farmers are often the target of criticism thanks to the funding. Using the pasture fence funding, a total of 25 plots from eleven participants were fenced off in 2013. The areas kept open with these amount to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023. Of the total costs, to the tune of 71,500 euros, half was funded via Leader, and a quarter was borne by the community of Fischerbach. The farmers were thus left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in the 16.2-kilometre pasture fence. "The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job. Without farmers we'd not be able to function." Peter Weiß is also standing firm: "First-class foodstuffs are produced here." The Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation (LPR) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible. Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open. A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR. In addition, the fenced-off area is not allowed to be farmable with a tractor (gradient of over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation. For the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project, an application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build just shy of 16 kilometres of fence. The areas of land to be kept open equate to 35 hectares; the calculated costs amount to more than 112,000 euros.
Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking In past two decades, an ever decreasing number of people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking. This is the conclusion drawn by scientists from the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study. "According to our estimations, 167 lung cancer deaths a year can be attributed to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher. For comparison, he referred to one of his own studies on this topic from 1994. Back then, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking every year in Germany. The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health."
Home connections prove to be very complex The building works in Villinger Straße are in full throw and "are more or less on schedule," according to the manager of the construction yard, Fred Heinze. In terms of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since lots of things are hidden in the substrate that were not noted in the plans. The traffic, which always disrupts building works, poses a big problem for the Stumpp company construction crew. "The ignorance of car drivers around red lights and barriers is really huge," reports Heinze. The street is closed off and only the public busses are allowed to drive through. Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been engaged in the works on the bridges for weeks. "The hot days were pretty exhausting, for sure. But luckily we were supplied with cold mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," explained Marvin Kostorz.
No Davis Cup reform: Best-of-five continues The president of the International Tennis Federation has failed with his big Davis Cup coup in the general assembly. At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the (for this sport) revolutionary suggestion to from now on play the Davis Cup singles over only best-of-three sets received just shy - by a whisker - of the necessary two-thirds majority in support. The admittedly often very long, but for that reason also greatly treasured, five-set classics are therefore surviving in the traditional competition. 63.54 per cent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform; ITF president David Haggerty's objective was therefore only just missed. "We respect the decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup. We need change in order to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historic competition," said Haggerty. There will continue to be work done to improve the competition. After many objections beforehand already, the suggestion to hold the final at a neutral location did not even make it to the vote. New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: so, in future, the finalists of the David Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year. In order to keep costs to a minimum for organisers, the requirements in matters of training courts etc. are being simplified and the players will not have to give so many official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders Electronics-multi-talent Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3." Up until now, he has withheld the fact that a portion of these customers have already cancelled their non-binding reservations. Alongside the always triumphant figures for sales increases and the even more gigantic sales targets, with the announcement of the most recent quarterly financial statement, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time had to reveal another, less glamorous number: that of the cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3. In recent months, Musk had frequently used those more than 500,000 pre-orders to talk up the new car, for which distribution is just starting. Musk now concedes that of the 518,000 total pre-orders, 63,000 have already been retracted. Critics had time and again pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations. In cases of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000-euro (in the USA, 1000-US-dollar, and in Great Britain, 1000-pound) "reservation deposit" back in its entirety. There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, conceded Musk in a conference call with analysts. However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem. His argument: The challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side. Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles. In 2018 - all models taken together - it is said to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million. The demand is therefore clearly there. According to Musk, a further 1800 reservations arrive each day. Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - that's if Tesla manages to get its brand-spanking new production lines going, as of yet never tested in practice, without any major interruptions and at maximum capacity. Many experts doubt whether that's possible. Should there be major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla. For the company cannot then prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.
Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, invitations are being issued to a serenade in the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm. Due to its idyllic setting and beautiful view over the village, the historical site of St. Hilarius is a beloved place to tarry a while. Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can let themselves be enchanted by this powerful place. The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area their concern. Walter Martini stresses: "It is a one-of-a-kind rural jewel." The St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in records in 1267 in the Württemberg register: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church for Tumlingen on it, together with the Bailiwick" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks. According to the text of the official document, aside from the former parish church, a lordly farm also stood on the Tumlingen mountain, which itself owned the church, or the right of patronage, and not the other way around. People therefore also lived there too. As is apparent from the upper administrative office for Freudenstadt's description in 1858, the "mountain" was, alongside the lower village and the upper village that can just about be made out still in the appearance of Tumlingen today, the village's third, grand centre of settlement. All maps from the time of around 1600 substantiate this historical reality. The right of patronage arose out of the Early Middle-Age proprietary church law. A lord who built and furnished a church and staffed it with a priest still remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequeath this proprietary church right. Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or nominate a new priest to the bishop. There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower. The larger of the two shattered at Christmas 1673. The newly acquired bell then first chimed in 1692, but had to later be surrendered in the Second World War, in 1942. During the 30 Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes stolen. The roof was leaky. In 1796, French troops made camp in the vicinity of the church. They brought out the pulpit and the pews and used them as firewood. The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809. Up until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen served as the last place of rest for Hörschweiler's dead. In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished. Only the church tower was left standing. On new year's eve of 1834, a storm cleaved the church tower and half of it collapsed. In order to prevent an accident, the tower was pulled down. Only the dwarf tower that is still present today survived as witness of the church's 750-year-old history. Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Industrious Pensioners" care for the Hilarius site, as successors of Dieter Dockhorn. As event organiser, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen are issuing invitations to the sixth serenade in the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel, on Sunday 16th July. It is being arranged by the Kepler Gymnasium, Freudenstadt, combo, with speeches from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis. Municipal administrator Hartmut Romann gave the closing words. The programme starts at 4.30pm. Last admission is at 3.30pm. The serenade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the cemetery. "Enjoy a summer's evening under the shadows of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows right up to forest," invite the organisers, emphasising the fantastic view. The serenade will only take place in the case of dry weather. The organisers are hoping for many backers in favour of preserving the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to Tumlingen and to Hörschweiler. The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen feel especially bound to take care of their local region, as serenade organiser Walter Martini reinforced.
Association wants to have wind turbine approval examined "Boisheim wehrt sich," sees no legal basis for the construction and has therefore turned to the District Administrator. The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to retract his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette. They say it was unlawful. The association argues that at the time the approval was given on 30th December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in Bosheimer Nette, since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Viersen, on the city boundary with Schwalmtal. Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area. Such zones are said to prevent "asparagusisation" of the landscape. The city of Viersen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, through an amendment to the local land-use plan - but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error. "Due to the lack of legal planning requirements, the approval decision that was issued is still unlawful, and should therefore be retracted as well," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich." The current state of affairs: the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the regional government is still pending. Erkens: "Grant of approval for the construction of wind turbines on this site is therefore precluded by planning law." The district confirms receipt of the call for action. "The relevant correspondence was received by the district of Viersen in the last week," declared a spokesperson. The district is taking it as a reason to investigate the matter afresh. However, it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings. With a view to the proceedings underway at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wehrt sich." NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a plot by Bosheimer Nette. The company, in which the city of Viersen holds indirect participating interests, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site last year already. The construction of the four wind turbines should cover the energy requirements of around 11,400 households - that equates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Viersen households. NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros. Last summer, Viersen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Übachpalenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident A terrible accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district). In it, a woman was fatally injured. Two other people were mildly injured. The road remained closed for hours. According to police information, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich, practising accompanied driving in her car with her 53-year old mother, the accompanying driver, was using the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
Town and dealers plan "hometown shopping" weekend Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September. The trade association and town authorities want to use the weekend of the 8th and 9th September to entice residents to a shopping spree in the town centre. As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "home-town shopping" weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual supermarket goods. A market with local suppliers is thus planned, similar to the weekly market. In addition, homegrown companies are to give showcases, with their apprenticeship places. Furthermore, the businesses in the town centre are to invite people to come "midnight shopping." The campaign is not only for residents of the town and the nearby region. Adverts on the radio, an online video and printed bags that allude to the campaign weekend are in preparation, Christian König tells us. Town authorities and the trade association are cooperating with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the "attractive town centre" project. To this belong new offerings such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival along with Sunday trading, talks with all the traders and proprietors to induce people to actively participate. Attractive offers on the Saturday and waiving of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept. In addition, new and existing customer bases can be developed. This includes spa guests and tourists. But many locals too had lost sight of the town centre for shopping. Ultimately, it all has to contribute to breathing life into the town centre - right up to landlords, businesses across the whole town and associations. We have to overcome the lethargy with a network that has partly built up, König had said in the spring. Brigit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in Mühlhausen communicated that five Thüringen towns are taking part in the nation's third "hometown shopping" day. Alongside Bad Lagensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode. The day is intended to "promote appreciation for local trade and emphasise more strongly its importance for the common good of our towns," said Streich. The campaign, under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion in US school During construction works, there was a huge gas explosion in the school building. Another nine people were wounded. At a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have died and nine others have been injured, some of which seriously. According to information from the fire department, one injured person was still in a critical condition on Wednesday (local time). One person died as a part of the school building collapsed during the explosion. Someone initially classed as missing was later also recovered dead. The dead were employees at the school. Authorities suspected works on a gas pipe to be the cause of the accident. Being holiday time, only a few people were in the Minnehaha Academy building.
"Götterdämmerung" propitiates Wagnerians in Bayreuth In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf again focusses on a colourful and frivolous production, set against a giant, six-storey backdrop. The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner, complete with remains of the Wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the DDR times, or the New York stock exchange. In front is parked an open vintage Mercedes car, in which the Rhinemaidens pose like rocker girls, or alternatively, an Isetta. Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - gold, power and greed - that runs through his production of the "Ring." The three Rhinemaidens - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - work wonderfully together, as they did already in "Rheingold." They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), lug a body in the boot in Hollywood manner, and play the riotous clique. Stephen Milling sings the part of the superbly nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavy-weight boxer. The scene where he slays Siegfried is brutal. Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) cops it too. The audience thanks the ensemble with mighty applause. There is a rapturous reception for Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who effaces himself and bows his hands, forming a Merkel diamond. There is huge applause for the Festival Orchestra, who appear on stage for the first time - in casual leisurewear in view of the high heat. The performance from Frank Castorf and his directing team had been awaited with excitement. Even if in 2013 he had had to endure another hall full of shrill catcalls, five years later there were great cheers, which drowned out the isolated boos. Festival head Katharina Wagner will likely have been delighted. "Once can see that the audience has in some way grown into the "Ring,"" she had said shortly before the performance from the dpa. The audience has not only made a kind of peace with Castorf, but on top of that, an understanding for his point of view has grown. I see positive results.
Max Menge works as volunteer During your voluntary service year, you're working at many locations simultaneously. What are all the different places? Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, and once a week I help out here in Greven in the Möbelbrücke. And I have also worked at the full-day school in their supplementary activities. What are your experiences of that? Menge: It is a nice, broad spectrum that I see here. I deal with different people: with adolescents, with refugees, with young adults. You are 26 years old now, so a volunteer with a late-calling. How did that come about? Menge: I did my Abitur exams. And then I successfully abandoned, shall we say, a civil engineering course of studies. I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else, work with people. And then I asked myself, what do you do? Do a social year, you can get an insight, can see what it is really like on site, in the thick of things too perhaps. And was it like that? Menge: I gathered great insights. I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester. I will study in dual, probably do an apprenticeship as a welfare worker at the Herne child protective services and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences. Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service? Menge: Yes, it is very variable. It always depends on where one is doing their voluntary service year. One can do it from at the old people's home right up to in youth work - in all possible facets of social work. In my case, it was very varied. I was also sometimes at the open full-day schools, that is, for the afternoon care. For me that was exactly the right thing, the thing that got me fired up. I was able to recognise and see my own strengths, as it was really happening. Differently from when doing the civil engineering studies? Menge: Yeah, sure; here it's not about working out statistics. One always has other people at the front of their minds, people who all have totally different histories behind them. Whether it's a refugee or an adolescent who has been pulled out of their family - you always have to approach it individually. Very interesting. And they didn't have any fear of contact? Menge: I'm not the kind of guy for that. It is an area that gives one a lot. A lot of love, a lot of friendliness. There are negative moments too sometimes, but that's just life.
Municipal council wants common room In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln passed a resolution for a common room in the future retirement home. Ahead of the debate, there is an important piece of information to be had: the purchase contract for the as yet still needed plot section has been signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden. Admittedly it will still be a while until the plot, which up until now has belonged to the church parish, comes into the possession of the municipality, but nevertheless, there are now no longer any planning obstacles for the project that has to be materialised by a private investor. That is why there is a debate concerning a common room. One of the two investors that are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality. For a special price, it would provide a living space - of around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with no less than 70 square metres on the ground floor. What the management and the majority of the municipal council have in mind is not simply to set aside such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior citizens' accommodation, but for it to be open to the community. Talk of a "knitting café" was making the rounds, for example. The decision, which was already pre-determined last Autumn through the allocation of resources for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities. The building is in an area for redevelopment. The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support, reports Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent. So as to signal to the investor that no-one wants to put a spoke in their wheel, the proposed resolution makes allowances for the determination that both a saddled roof - based on the surrounding buildings - and a mono-pitch roof - which reduces the height of the eaves and makes the building more economical - would be possible. An uneccessary addition, thinks not only Wilfried Sohmer. If it helps: it passes through the committee unanimously. It's not so easy with the common room. Daniela Ruf points to their many owned buildings that are not really being forged ahead, but instead they are going out of their way with the common room: "I have difficulty with that," she says. Yvonne Staiger declares herself to be unequivocally in favour of the common room - but absolutely against an investment from the municipality. She views that as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy, or even foreign, investors. That is simply not true according to the counterargument, for by purchasing the plot they are not giving away any grants, but are rather getting a genuine, when in doubt saleable, equivalent in value. Staiger's proposal, to split up the proposed resolution accordingly, has three supporters. So, with two dissenting votes, they are sticking with the original programme, which Stefan Haller summed up as follows: "If we pass the resolution as so, we make a huge step towards plugging a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with a car: Cyclist hurled onto the road The 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car whilst crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured. According to police reports, the 82-year-old from Langenfeld was travelling on his bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg cycle lane at around 12.20pm, coming from the direction of Hilden. The senior citizen wanted to cross the lane of traffic up where the street Am Buchholzer Busch is. A woman driving a car in the same direction gave way to him. However, as the man from Langenfeld cycled onto the road, he evidently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic. He collided with a car being driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden. The man was hurled onto the road. He suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospital in an ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich have to do without David Alaba and Thiago for the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund The Super Cup is happening without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund. With squad concerns, FC Bayern are travelling to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season. The title-defender is missing seven of its pros in the Super Cup against the cup winners. The squad concerns are getting even bigger for the German football record champions Bayern Munich ahead of the Super Cup on Saturday (8.30pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winners Borussia Dortmund. Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to also do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB. The Italian confirmed that on Friday. In addition, the Munich team is missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat. Ancelotti blamed the physical state of his team and the lack of balance in their game for their five defeats in the past six friendlies. "We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding, "The most important point is the balance in the team. That has not been good recently." However, the 58-year-old believes that they can improve their performance in the first official competitive game of the season. "Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation. I have great confidence that my team exhibits these qualities. The team is ready. We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who is expecting a "difficult, intense game." The duel between the two German football heavyweights is captivating the fans. With 81,360 spectators, the game is sold out, shared the German football league (DFL) on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the Harz The nation's first "astral path" is to come to life in the Harz. It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory society. There has been a planetary trail in Göttingen since 2003. An "astral path" satisfies many Harz visitors' need for information, it is said. It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance. Members want to set up plaques along the planned route and put information about stars and constellations on them. In a first phase, until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz. In the running are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber. The information on the plaques is to be expanded upon online. So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations. Accessibility is also a criterion. The astral path is later to be extended, step by step. "Spectators will gain lots of useful knowledge on the astral path, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the society. In addition, they will learn why stars have different colours, or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is significantly further away. It will also teach which constellation a selected star is located in, and when the best time to see it is. The society has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany, in the small mountain town of St. Andreasberg, since 2014 already. The location in the middle of the Harz national park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. One can regularly clearly see the Milky Way, and even the Andromeda Galaxy, from there with naked eyes. The university town, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium friends' association, has had something similar to the astral path since 2013 - the planetary trail. Starting at Gebhards Hotel in Goethealle, which forms the centre of our solar system, the planetary trail leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extra-terrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna. The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto, which was downgraded to a dwarf planet, at the end point - are set up at exact intervals and on a scale of one to two billion. The Earth thus shrinks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres. The total distance covered by the planetary trail is a good four kilometres. While the light of the sun needs around eight hours to reach Pluto, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto. So, pedestrians are faster than light in space. The trek to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though.
Four injured after burst tyre In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were injured, some severely. According to initial reports, the driver of an Opel Zaifra lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30pm, shortly before the Marktbreit junction, after a burst tyre. The car slid right into the embankment, where it overturned and then lay on its roof, on the grass verge. The four passengers - two adults and two children - were, in part, severely injured in the accident. While first aid was being given to the injured by the emergency services, the A7 was closed for around an hour in the northerly direction, before traffic was able to be led round the site of the accident in the left lane.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three at the back works better" Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to kick off the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points in Aue. Andre Hoffmann was content with the first game of the season, and with the result too, were it not for the two own goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig. "That was two own goals too many, and in Aue, we have to take better care still," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf. The line of three at the back is to be optimised even further in the Ore mountains. And the Fortunas don't want to let in any more goals after free kicks either. "In future, no-one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing) any more." Hoffmann is convinced that his team manages better with the three-at-the-back formation, even after the experiences in the build-up. "I don't know yet how we will play in Aue," said the coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoachmann is sure of himself, "because in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well," said Hoffmann. "However, a prerequisite is that we harmonise even better together and don't commit so many passing errors in the build up." Naturally, Hoffmann is also travelling to Aue to win the game. "Whether after one draw though one can talk of a failed start, I don't know. The performance could by all means be okay," said Hoffmann. "However, if we're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season kick-off." His coach didn't want to hear any of that. "I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony team's game in Heidenhelm had to be cut-off early due to a storm. "Now they are effectively able to start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffman believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be somewhat fresher, since they don't have any difficult and full games like Fortuna against one of the promotion favourites resting in their bones. "But they don't know 100 per cent where they stand at the moment," says the Fortuna central defender. Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished Aue stadium as slight favourites. "That we are going to sweep them away just because we can claim a place amongst the top six is ridiculous," says Funkel, whose balance sheet against Aue, with only one defeat in nine games, is thoroughly positive. "There is no team in the second Bundesliga that one has to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach. "To give such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous." And Funkel does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday.
Right on target The works on the three bridges of the L 108 road, between Lauterbach and Schramberg, are progressing well. On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach. "We're doing very well for time - it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government. In April, works began on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time. The works are scheduled to be completed in October, and Leicht is certain that the timetable will be stuck to. The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach. It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete that is covered in red variegated sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres. It was built in 1900. Like the other two bridges, it is old by now. In order to ensure their stability and road safety, the three structures now have to be thoroughly renovated. The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach. They are made of variegated sandstone. Both were erected in 1939 and they are twelve and 10.60 metres high, respectively. The bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now - as of Wednesday morning - been given a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne-heavy so-called bridge parapet on its north side. This fixes the boundary and is also used as a passenger path. A 2.20-metre-wide bridge parapet is to be put in place on the south part of the bridge on Friday. The pedestrian walkway is intended to then to run over that. What is special about this is that is uses finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo. The other two bridges are already kitted out with the patented bridge parapets. Laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach required particular flair. For a fibreglass cable also runs there, which many companies are connected to. In the run-up to the works, residents were informed about the project via a leaflet. Fish and crabs must also be fished out first. For the bridges between the construction yard building and the lake reservoir in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane and regulated by lights. For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge, where the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels are, is fully closed. Altogether, the costs for the three bridge renovations total 700 000 euros. The entire project is being funded by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest with German potato salad It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany (AfD), people come together who would otherwise be difficult to reconcile. The parties who represent in the Vulkan Eifel district council (CDU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, FWG, die Linke) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully nailing its colours to the mast on this day because the AfD are holding a "big kick-off to the election campaign" in Gerolstein Town Hall plaza. And are launching famous names - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland makes up the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24th September, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch. But those who have been on site for hours already before the start of the event don't want to listen to the AfD, but rather, demonstrate. The motto: "Eifel is staying colourful." Originally the town picnic was planned for Brunnenplatz square under the motto "everyone at one table," but now is taking place in the carpark beneath the shopping plaza - and therefore directly in sight of those coming to the AfD event in the Town Hall. A colourful picture on show there. And what really delighted Christa Karoli, chairperson of the Eine Welt (One World) Forum and one of the leading organisers: "It's great how many people have come together here." There's music and all sorts of food, including a "typical German potato salad" that even the AfD would have no problem eating," said the woman who had brought it. The police had summoned lots of officials to Gerolstein and were above all also present at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the event locations. How did the AfD make it to Gerolstein, actually? Mario Hompe from the Vulkan Eifel AfD reports that he strove hard to get such an event and that he won the contract. The 45-year-old from Gönndersdorf had originally inquired in Daun, but had got a no there because there were not enough parking places available due to the St. Lawrence funfair already being set up. So now, the shopping plaza; Hompes is delighted that "we are able to hold such a wonderful event here." With a view to the event on the plaza forecourt he says: "It's the people's right. The main this is that it stays peaceful." And it does: at around 8pm some entertainment is provided, by a band on the plaza forecourt, and in the town hall, by various speakers, including Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge. In the hall there are about 200 in attendance, waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch, to give their speeches. The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials have had a quiet evening. The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour; the guests in the forecourt have a long wind, but even there it is time to clear up shortly after 9pm. The police can go away - no specific incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet There is another chance to hear Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslach cloister concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church. Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he is giving a concert that carries the slogan "The Black Sea meets the Black Forest," or even, "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music. Both soloists are winners and awardees of numerous international competitions and hold soloist positions in leading European orchestras. So, Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra. Both have in common a passion not only for transcending the boundaries of their instruments but also for conflating the boundaries of the various genres. So, Johann Sebastian Bach played by the two of them takes on a whole new sound, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suits" from JazzEcho prize-winner Nils Wogram, they blend classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating complete art work. This centrepiece of the programme had its debut performance in Freiburg this spring, to great success. The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and there's more: the Haslach monastery church, with its special acoustic, was consciously incorporated into the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality "Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives. But I want to try everything." This is what Kristen Stewart said in total frankness on the topic of her bisexuality. "If I bite into grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'." The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was probably that with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which came apart bitterly in the end. Despite all that, the brunette actress assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated. Or did you think I was faking it?" After their split, Kristen came out as bisexual: "I've always really lived for that duality and seriously believed in it. It has never confused me or held me back. I just never liked being made fun of." She suffered from this especially in her school days, according to "Bang Showbiz," when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls. That really, really hurt me. When I was eleven, kids told me I looked like a boy. I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed. Now I look back and think: 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'." She particularly doesn't like explaining her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that makes me angry. And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the entire public."
Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali At a memorial service in the north Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people commemorated both soldiers who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Mali. The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precautions. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) remained silent on the as-yet-unexplained cause of the crash. However, she described the two pilots who were killed as "experts in their field." "We bow before this greatest of sacrifices that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained. The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from north Hessen lost their lives a week ago, on Wednesday, in the West African country of Mali. Their coffins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter's cathedral in Fritzlar, accompanied by a wake from the German army. At midday, the relatives first said their goodbyes in the church. Then, amidst family and closest friends, the memorial service was begun by representatives of the German Army and the political world. Among these were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Inspector General of the German Army, Volker Wieker. Memorial guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins. The people of Fritzlar and numerous soldier followed the ceremony in front of the church on a big screen. Defence minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in missions. The Stabshauptmann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots in his regiment. Volker Bauersachs too, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew were not able to prevent the crash, then no-one could have." Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous. However, it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two nations," she said. After the memorial service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral. The Germany Army did not wish to give any indications about when or where they are to be buried.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prinz Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death. The royal family shared that on Thursday. Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are interred in Roskilde Cathedral. The sculptor Bildhauer Bjørn Nørgaard is already crafting a sarcophagus for the two of them. The queen is content with her husband's decision, the announcement continued. Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear. However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland. Prinz Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title. After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king. In 2016, he went into retirement and at the same time also laid aside his title of "Prince Consort." Since Henrik did not get the title and function that he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death either, explains Lene Balleby, chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family. Where the last place of rest will be in the end for the 83-year-old is still unclear. However, he does not intend to be interred in his French homeland, but rather in Denmark. He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years. Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a noble French family, he had got to know Margrethe in 1965 in London. He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy. Whereas the people's expressions of sympathy always flew to his then to be wife, Prinz Henrik had a hard time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign. In an autobiography, Henrik commented on his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything that I did was criticised. My Danish was faltering, I preferred wine to beer, silk socks to wool socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football. Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco, and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellectuals who were critical of society, I could not hope for any leniency. I was different. It seemed I was happy with this position and not ashamed of it. Those were two errors!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a snap new election CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) wants the State Parliament to have a snap new election after the loss of the red-green governing majority - but he doesn't want to step down. Weil declared himself on Friday to be in favour of a dissolution of the Parliament. Previously, the unexpected resignation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) 's government into a stark crisis. Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition lost in Hanover, and with that, their scant one-vote majority in Parliament over the opposition of CDU and FDP. Elke Twesten, up until that point a Green Party representative, justified her move with the fact that she had not been nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme). "I see my political future in the CDU," she stated on Friday in Hanover. CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his party to take her in. Then the CDU and the FDP would together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament, and the Greens, 68 seats. Up until now, that ratio was the other way around. The new State Parliament will be elected as normal on the 14th January next year. Thümler says that the red-green State Government now has to decide whether it can continue to govern in these circumstances without a majority. However, Stephan Weil considers it imperative that the State Parliament vote to dissolve itself as swiftly as possible. The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday about how they will proceed. The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament declares no confidence in the Prime Minister and elects a successor. "Our constitution offers various options. The possibilities have to be examined in a proper legal way," said Thümler. "All aspects will be debated in good time, if they are examined in a sound legal way." Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious though." The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor. I feel very good." She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green. The Greens called on the defecting representative to give up her seat in Parliament. "We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament, which she won on a Green party ticket, with immediate effect," communicated state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner. The Green Party chairwoman Anja Piel said: "We exceedingly regret Elke Twesten's decision." She consciously decided not to give any statement in the parliamentary group. "Especially given the background, that there were no essential differences - we can't understand this move." SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz denounced the crossing over of Lower Saxony Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal. "The behaviour of the former Green representative in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal to red-green," wrote the Social Democratic federal leader on Friday on Facebook. He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) 's decision to let the State Parliament have new elections soon. Twesten's resignation costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony. The politician "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration" put "her personal interests above the wellbeing of the state," critisised SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil. "It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony plays along in this dirty scheming and attempts to score political points from it." Lower Saxony CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his representatives to take Elke Twesten into the CDU. The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Opperman, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career notions. The CDU was then the strongest power ahead of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in interview - How do we protect ourselves against poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt? Germany is discussing contaminated eggs. How was it possible for the scandal to happen? How can consumers protect themselves? Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers our questions in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND). Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs? I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the stamps printed on them. The federal states are each supplying their most up-to-date information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de. Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned. Even if, according to everything we know at this point in time, a health risk is all but ruled out. Is Aldi now adopting the best possible reaction to the crisis - removing all eggs from their offering - because the Federal Minister of Food and Agriculture is not really playing the central role of providing clear information? Monitoring foodstuffs is a task for the federal states. Despite that, the ministry immediately connected and has been liaising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected. All information and the risk assessment are accessible to consumers. It is up to the trade just as much as it is the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold meet trading requirements and do not present any health risks. For eggs, if the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded, then they do not meet trading requirements. Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed. This time the businesses are not at fault. Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat? According to what we currently know, the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame. In fact, due to suspected illegal practices by service companies, they have to deal with commercial claims. As always in emergencies, there are too few inspectors. Is it just the number of staff that is lacking, or the key competence as well? It was actually the official controls themselves that exposed what was going on. However, we must also remember that food fraud and criminal activity can never be 100% eliminated. It is for precisely this reason that it is so crucially important to have such occurrences thoroughly cleared up and passed over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes could have committed. I have already made it clear many times that I am expecting a complete resolution from the authorities in charge. Is the alarmism that regularly arises with food scandals really necessary? Consumers have the right to get only safe food that is approved for market. If a prohibited insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are quite right to be indignant. Thanks to these adulterated products, manufacturers, retailers and consumers get into a situation that is entirely unnecessary. Fundamentally the following has to be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately. Work must be done on this consistently and urgently at all levels. I expect all responsible authorities to clear up the matter swiftly and completely.
Swiss is on the look out for a new choccy supplier In the last few years, Chocolat Frey has made on-board chocolates for Swiss. Now the sweet collaboration faces a possible end: the airline is inviting new calls for tenders. Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott, in response to a query from news agency sda, confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday. According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half year of 2018. The products would be reviewed and undergo a quality control every two to three years. "We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman. Every year, around 17 million small 14-gram chocolate bars packaged in red and white are handed out by the flight attendants to passengers before landing. Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs. According to "Nordwestschweiz," industry insiders estimate the order volumes to be 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion francs. However, more important is always the advertising effect: for a chocolate producer, it is a prestigious contract. Swiss will not disclose how many bidders there are for the new call for tenders. However, only Swiss producers are eligible. According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018. The biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available to the sda for a statement. Swiss has been handing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006. Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate bars, in collaboration with Hug. Swiss introduced the possibility of inserting a logo two and a half years ago, at the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey. The airline collaborates with various Swiss chocolate manufacturers. On long-haul flights, the first class customers are spoiled with treats from confectioner Sprüngli; in business class, passengers nibble on chocolate from Lindt, and in economy class, chocolate from Chocolat Frey. On short-haul routes too, Swiss hands out chocolate from Chocolate Frey, both in business and in economy class.
Track-and-field discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Championship finals The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the finals on Saturday. His brother Christoph, Olympic champion in 2016, had been unsuccessful in the national World Championship qualifier and could only watch the discus contest from the stands. Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski also qualified for the final showdown with his first attempt, throwing 65.13 metres.
Blow dealt to drug mafia in the country The police have delivered a successful blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden Württemberg. On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, numerous properties were searched in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, said the Konstanz public prosecutor's office on Friday. In the course of this, 15 accused, aged between 25 and 77, were detained and already had arrest warrants issued against them. In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros. At simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were detained. German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians. Both of them were therefore presumably extradited to Germany. Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation. In total, over 300 policemen were deployed. The mafia members were charged with organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion. Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already. There was an active exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators from Rottweil CID had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily. The major operation on Wednesday morning was thus attended by four officials from Palermo. The investigations then turned their sights above all to Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia. An incident on 27th May in Hüfingen, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to have been caused by the gang.
Weise complains of big holes in the Register of Foreign Nationals "Data for citizens that ought not to be showing up there": according to a report, the Register of Foreigner Nationals in Germany is exhibiting significant defects. This is leading to some grave mistakes in decisions within asylum procedures. Frank-Jürgen Weise, the official appointee of the German Government for the management of refugees, has brought attention to big holes in the Central Register of Foreign Nationals, according to one media report. Defects in the data registered there could lead to "some grave mistakes in decisions" when it comes to asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis received by the Süddeutsche Zeitung. According to that information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, among whom around 5.7 million from non-EU states. The data are managed by around 600 Foreigners' Registration Offices in Germany. Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained, it said, the quality of the data has in part not been good to date. In some cases, data from 1921 was found, "from people who have long been dead, or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register." "Erroneous data entries can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues. Moreover, within the statistics on those people who are obliged to leave the country are recorded EU citizens, who do not at all have to leave. Such false categorisations, however, led to "a biased debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave the country," it says accordingly in the analysis. Meanwhile, the German Government has apparently begun to send back to Italy refugee families with children under 16 years of age, if this is where they entered the country from. This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung." In the paper, it says that the BAMF has been once more transacting such procedures "that concern families with children - with the exception of infants and very small children - to Italy since 1st June 2017." Since the end of 2014, that had practically no longer been possible, says the newspaper, pointing to the difficult situation on the ground. According to the Dublin Regulation, it is the EU state the refugee first reaches that is responsible for them. If a migrant travels further into another EU country, this state can send him back to the country he entered from. As a means of justification, the office writes: "By now, the intake capacity for families with children who are minors has significantly increased in Italy." Italy has provided guarantees for the intake and accommodation of families. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself considers these pledges to be sufficient. Other EU states too would send back refugees there using the scope of the Dublin Agreement. The Linke party's spokeswoman for domestic poicy, Ulla Elpke, criticised this decision: "Due to shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with conditions of admission that contravene human rights and with risk to the child's welfare"
Second-best result achieved Altogether, the blood donor service made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for others. At least, from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday. Ahead of everyone is Jürgen Greule, who has by now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations. The community traditionally acknowledges the repeated willingness to give blood in the meeting of its municipal council. "It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for strangers, and so selflessly," stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner. "One single blood donation helps multiple people," explained the district head of the on-call service of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the reserves are broken down into their components. So, as many as three people could benefit from a single blood donation. At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring. "This year, we achieved our second best result ever, with 114 donors," said the DRK on-call district head. Obviously the move into the theatre venue a few years ago led to a higher number of participants. Already before then, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were numbered amongst the repeat donors and honoured for having made 50 donations each. Half as many were clocked up by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Reixinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood.
Most-wanted criminals receive post from Europol As the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is being requested and hoped for. Police across all of Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run. Since the addresses of the sought-after serious criminals are not known, they are hoping and asking for tips from the population. Europol reported on Friday about the campaign, which follows on from the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter. Experience has shown that many fugitives hide out in holiday destinations, was the word from Europol. 21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries have been assembled. The website www.eumostwanted has existed since 2016, and has been visited more than 2.5 million times. It has so far been possible to arrest 36 of those being sought online; at least 11 of these are due to tips following publication on the internet site.
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise The former Hotel Birkenhof is being turned into the Waldhotel Luise. The house just outside Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and should be opened again on 1st March next year. That is good news for the city. For when the Hotel Birkenhof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014, at the time around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, and with that, the income from the visitors' taxes. In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing, which sparked controversial discussions. The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location. The decision passed in the municipal council back then without controversy. Yet Freudenstadt's lord mayor, Julian Osswald, in particular, defended the hotel location and already back then spoke of serious interested parties in the establishment. And he was right. The Luisenhotels Group, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three-stars-or-more category, under the name Waldhotel Luise. The group has four establishments including the Freudenstadt property. Two of them are in Bad Bergzabern, and one is in Bad Herrenalb. They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and, now, Waldhotel Luise. There has been a skip standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear just how extensive the refurbishment works are that are being undertaken. The floors have been ripped out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bath tubs taken out of the rooms. The entire hotel building is one big construction site. There is still a lot to do before March. "It is truly a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our paper. Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style. The rooms are being kitted out with large, walk-in showers, the entrance foyer is being revamped, new windows are being installed. Everything should later become "beautifully in touch with the people," is how Thomas Scherer expressed it. "We want to make a gem of it." Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities. One doesn't want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but still at an elevated downtown level, stressed Scherer. The Waldhotel Luise, with its roughly 60 rooms, wants to set itself up for a broad audience, explains Scherer further. Individual holiday-makers, groups, and business people, should all feel at home in the hotel. Scherer said that he had already had conversations with Lord Mayor Julian Osswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause. The city's expectations are said to be in line with those of the hotel group. "We're on the same page." Asked about the level of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to commit himself precisely. A little under a million euros, he reckons. The outside facilities are also being revamped - that can already be seen. In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is taking shape, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public. Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US Special Counsel convenes grand jury In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have convened a so-called grand jury, according to one report. The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal," relying on sources intimately acquainted with the matter. The newspaper judged the step to be a sign that Mueller has broadened and intensified his investigations. The broadcaster CNN reported that the panel has already issued its first subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer. US secret service has long been accusing the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow. Several men who acted as Republican advisers during the election campaign are said to stand at the centre of the investigations. According to reports, Mueller has been subjecting Trump's private and business circles to more and more scrutiny. The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally shifted the centre of focus onto Trump and is investigating the charge of whether or not the President could have obstructed the course of justice during the affair. It is the main task of the grand jury to review the available evidence in cases of possible felonies and to decide whether charges should be brought. Grand juries are for this reason also called prosecution chambers. They are usually engaged for major and controversial cases. The procedure always takes place behind closed doors. The panel may also be engaged by the public prosecutor's office to subpoena people for questioning under oath. According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued in relation to a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. People who had been involved in this meeting had been summoned to give evidence, the report said. They were also supposed to make documents available. In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting. Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the convening shows that Mueller will not let himself be intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly, should that be necessary. However, this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges. Nevertheless, the convening of the panel signals the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and gives President Trump a new cause for concern. In the midst of these new revelations, the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening in order to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents. "The Russia story is a total fabrication," said Trump. He said the subject gives Democrats an opportunity "to feel better when they have nothing else to talk about." His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the convening of a grand jury. But it usually operates in secret, he stressed. The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Counsel in a "fair" way. Former head of the FBI James Comey said three times that the President was not under investigation, he said. There is no reason to presume that anything has changed, his statement continued. However, Mueller was only engaged after Trump had fired Comey. Due to the sacking, accusations were raised that he wanted to obstruct the course of justice. Comey stated before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to put an end to the investigations into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The President was under a lot of pressure because of the investigation. As the US media portrays it, the White House gathered materials against the Special Counsel and his colleagues. This gave rise to speculations about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller. Unlike an independent Special Counsel of Congress, such as, for example, in the Watergate scandal concerning President Richard Nixon, who later stepped down, Mueller is in a position where, in theory, he could be fired by the justice department if the President pushed for it. However, various senators, from both parties, want to avoid such a move. Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Counsel to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts into the Antarctic In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf. The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven communicated this on Wednesday. The over a trillion-ton-heavy and 5800-square-kilometre-big colossus is now drifting to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt. With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades. It does not pose any danger for men. The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the iceberg breaking off is unclear from the research scientists' findings. Nevertheless, altogether, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years now, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a background fact report. Many researchers believe this could be connected to global warming. The now detached colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf. Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers. It thereby grows out ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off. The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The equilibrium between growing and breaking off became disrupted north of this ice shelf a few years ago. An entire ice shelf crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen. There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger too, for the front edge has never retreated so far back as it currently is. What is more, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point. The melting of shelf ice and icebergs do not raise sea water levels, since they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it itself produces after melting. However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the glaciers feeding directly into the sea, and being able to flow out much faster than before. The could potentially raise sea water levels, though only to a small degree, writes the British research project for monitoring the Antarctic (Midas). According to information from the AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf, at almost 50,000 square metres, is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica. It is up to 700 metres thick where it meets the mainland, and around 200 metres at the front edge to the open ocean. It regularly breaks off there. "Although this is a natural event, and we're not aware of any direct link to climate change, this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position," says Martin O'Leary from Britain's Swansea University. "This is the furthest back that it has been since records began," he also confirmed. There is disagreement among scientists as to whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or whether it is receding long term and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable." But this development will take decades. Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, nevertheless, very many ice shelfs in the Antarctic Peninsula have crumbled in recent decades. This long tail of Antarctica stretches towards South America. According to data from the research programme the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s. The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline. The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees in the last 50 years and is amongst those areas where temperatures are rising most quickly.
CDU want in-house wage agreement for staff Since it is getter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available, the CDU is calling for secession from the employers' association, so as to become more attractive. Shortly before the Summer recess, the district assembly rubber-stamped 41 new posts in the administration. More than 1100 permanent staff members and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann. Now another 17 trainees once more have their first working day behind them. The apprenticeship positions at the district are apparently very coveted. There were around 620 applications recorded for the places on offer this year. However, the district is lacking additional personnel which it needs to overcome growing demands and duties. Currently there are 50 positions at the district of Mettmann that are still unfilled. Sought after are, among others, doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff. The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to seize the initiative in the district assembly and counter the dearth of skilled workers in the administration. The administration is to "work out a plan for acquiring and developing staff," in line with the wishes of the parties. The plan is not only to satisfy short-term demand in skilled workers, but, with a view to the future, to counteract the shortage of applicants, it is reported. The entire concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for lateral entry employees, and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG. Well that does sound like a good approach. For the district has staffing problems, the likes of which it has not seen before. Other cities poach good officials and staff members and offer attractive conditions. The talk is of a downright "contest between public employers." In addition, a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age. High time to act then, so that not even more positions remain unfilled. Yet Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, is, with his party, going even beyond the joint request. Just recently he caused a huge surprise in the district assembly when he publicly called the staff capping into question and startled the other parties. Völker wants all avenues to be examined that enable a secession from the municipal employers' association. "If we don't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the district's towns - to secure an in-house wage agreement," said Völker. The CDU are thereby attempting to pay the permanent staff and officials better than the pay-scale for public sector workers actually allows for. Salaries are currently prescribed exactly, and there are only raises or more money when moves into a more senior level, which is based on years experience. Yet the district's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years. For the first time a few weeks ago, new premises had to be erected for staff to tackle the provisions of the new Prostitutes Protection Act. Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum, County Commissioner Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Ascents and trials Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost," and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions. Three chummy guides were on hand for this. The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours. Wachenheim's Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra. The first tour led along the vineyards, amidst hot summer temperatures, to the Chapel of St. Michael above Deidesheim. There followed viewing spots, some on towers, from which one could look far and wide over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains. In between, there were time and again long uphill climbs, for which long trials were the reward. On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim, to the salt works and to the Wurstmarkt festival. Again, there came vantage point after vantage point, strung together with "flowing" trials and moderate ascents. On the last two days, lots of high altitudes were on the cards again. Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment cabins brought welcome pauses. In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing salt water in the open-air inhalatorium. They headed for Neustadt too. After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga is getting ready for e-sport Will the sports stars of the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of battling sweatily, come wind or rain, on the stadium turf? The fact is, e-sport has long been a credible industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments, complete with big salaries. Even the top Bundesliga clubs have recognised this, and are getting more and more involved in this area. VfL Wolfsburg took the lead in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04, and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in the middle of July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17. "By doing this, we hope to get completely new, young target groups fired up about the VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann. He is sure "that countless more clubs are getting on board this train." The world football association, FIFA, is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" this coming weekend in London, which will see gamers from different clubs compete against each other. Alongside Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified, to give some examples. Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport. The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now consulting an agency for virtual footballers. "Real football has to deal in particular with the 14-30 year olds, so that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. And: the clubs are trying to conquer all possible markets, above all the Asian ones. With prominent e-sportspeople under contract, it would be possible to be present online in these markets vastly more often than the mere once a year the national team gets sent to Asia. What exactly is it about? In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulator FIFA are battled out on a competitive level. Just like in the regular sport, leagues have long been established, in which the pros compete against one another. And for the 2022 Asian Games, e-sport is already part of the official programme. But is it even a real sport? For many people, this notion certainly takes some getting used to. Ingo Froböse also grappled with this question for a long time. For the professor at the German Sports University of Cologne, e-sport is a sport, because it is competitive and features many biological and physical reactions that one also finds in classic sport - for example, a raised heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes. In addition, it requires cognitive capabilities, technical and tactical understanding and an ability to react quickly. Professional gamers ought to train not only on the console, but also their bodies, and should pay attention to their diet. "A fit player is a good player." Froböse sees problems too though: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue." For online games it is difficult to implement testing, and the scene is lacking the structures of the classic sport. The scientist positively stresses the highly integrative effect of e-sport. The players travel internationally, it is like a big global family, and there are no intercultural barriers. A study from consultancy firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for the e-sport. In 2016, it turned over 50 million euros in Germany, many through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments. In three years, the turnover should total 130 million. Compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga that is admittedly scant. However, the e-sport is "no longer far off other established sports like handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants. Many countries internationally are already further ahead. Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports. Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sport bookmaker Unikrn. In Europe too, quite a bit is happening. E-sport has been introduced to the curriculum in a Norwegian school, says Froböse. In the Netherlands and in France, the top division football clubs are now committed to setting up an e-sport department, according to Dutt. "Compared with the rest of Europe, Germany is lagging behind," declares VfB board member, Röttgermann. Simply to slide back into nostalgia and romanticise the old days is no longer enough these days. It's about preserving the tradition of the club while at the same time aligning the business with the modern market. "We are living in a digitalised world," says Dutt as well. "So you can't cling on to the idea that only in football, everything stays as it always was."
Farewell poisoned eggs! The egg alternative for cooking and baking By now, almost every Federal State has been affected by the scandal concerning poison-contaminated eggs. Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and withdrawn all eggs from sale across the whole of Germany. Only eggs that are proven not to contain Fipronil are to be stacked onto shelves.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini Lahm It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to take to the field as captain at the Audi Cup. FC Bayern thinks the Confederations Cup winner is capable of a big season - a bit of extra motivation doesn't hurt. Something was different there at his place in the dressing room; Joshua Kimmich noticed that immediately, even if the extra piece of kit was very, very small. But since on the second day of the Audi Cup there was of course no Philipp Lahm anywhere to be seen, and no Manuel Neuer either, he simply put the band he'd been allocated on his arm. "The coach didn't announce it," explained the Confederations Cup winner later, after his first outing as Bayern captain. Sure, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli. But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows. Out of the C team of youth players, debutants and pros just back from the holidays, it was not the eight-years-older Arturo Vidal that was chosen as captain, but him. Indeed, it is those that one thinks capable, those who one wants to keep happy that one likes to give treats to the most. And anyone chosen to take on the mantel of Lahm can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation. Kimmich confirmed: "That is what one wants as a player: to take on responsibility." The 22-year-old darted over the field like a mini Lahm on Wednesday. Right back, that's his position now; the white armband cast its habitual spell. And in general, Kimmich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the helm. He gave instructions, attempted to steer the out-of-practice troop. He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were busied with themselves. Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (didn't really work); Renato Sanches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip (worked, but to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not make a negative impression on their first outings in the Bayern jersey. That worked out quite well though. Süle took to the field alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence - both performed excellently. The renowned Napoli attack often made heavy weather of it, and on top of that, Süle made a couple of successful attempts as the game developed. His team mate, Rudy, admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for." But he too showed a decent performance on his debut. Shifting play, changing pace: "That's the style I was brought in for." Just how unused to new arrivals this Bayern world is could be seen after the match. Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but as many as six or seven interviews in the tunnels. Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp remarks in support of his new team mates. There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Süle there: "I've already noticed what went wrong here. At Bayern, you just have to win every game." He doesn't have to teach the newbies that anymore though.
Alaba motivates the ÖFB women David Alaba believes our ÖFB women will be successful Austria's most famous footballer spoke up shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB women all the best. The Bayern legionnaire is, after all, practically a club mate of the ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck, and cheers our ladies on. The tweet from the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner was intended to give a special injection of motivation. Our ladies could perhaps also do with a bit of that famous Bayern luck.
Companies happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing's speed The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irreconcilable when Evaline Lemke (The Greens) was still Rhineland Palatinate's Economic Affairs Minister. This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) being in office. Chambers and companies from the region are responding to a TV enquiry by speaking of a change in economic policy - and at the same time rebuke the old minister. Frank Natus, chairman of the association of Trier companies Vereinigung Trierer Unternehmen (VTU) says: "Wissing is addressing the wishes of the industry, all of which Lemke blocked." Natus considers the biggest U-turn to be in infrastructure policy: linking the A1 motorway between Kelber and Adenau is now right at the top of the state's list of priorities. The Ministry hopes that planning procedures will be in place this year already, and the construction rights should hold until 2021. The Trier western bypass also plays a role in the state's plans, being in the priority need category of The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan. The goal is to put the stretch into service in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann. Natus sees in this a roadmap for supporting regional, but internationally competitive, companies. The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving, as spurred on by Wissing, to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sagging German wine exports. In addition, Wissing is said to have a sympathetic ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK applauded. The Trier Chamber of Trades sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach. A prize of 1000 euros is envisaged for passing the master craftsman examination, and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of their master craftsman training. The state's list of homework assignments remains long though. Facts have to presented quickly for the road construction planned, and at the same time the state is lacking the necessary human resources, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Trier IHK. Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ at the Federal State Office for Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled thus far. The IHK is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices. Deputy leader of the CDU parliamentary faction Christian Baldauf points to calculations from the Court of Auditors: in 2017 and 2018, the state is investing more than 20 million euros less on maintaining federal state roads than recommended. Frank Natus is also still expecting the state to put forward a policy as to how it wants to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region. Also sobering is the expansion of broadband in the state up until now. In 2016, in an IHK survey, local companies had evaluated the mains supply with a mark of only 3.4. They complained about sluggish internet connections and outages. Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind. Lemke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - from where, after four months, she has already bid a retreat due to disagreements.
The raft on the Isar had this message on Saturday The city wants to protect the Isar. So that visitors to Isar play their part, a raft travelled through Munich on Saturday morning with a special message. Anyone drawn to the Isar again on Saturday will see a large raft there, between Flaucher and the Reichenbach bridge. An no normal raft that is, with Isar tourists. Rather, the building department wants to get a message across. There is a large information banner to be seen on the raft. It depicts a mountain of rubbish. The prelude to a publicity campaign that wants to call upon visitors to Isar. Using the motto "True love is...," the aim is to strengthen understanding for the Isar as a wild river deserving of protection. Last summer, the raft travelled over the Isar already, and this year too, there are further campaigns and measures to bring about thoughtful and environmentally aware behaviour.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughing in the face of sorrow Mordillo was for a while one of the most-published cartoonists; his figures' bulbous noses are his trade mark. Even at 85, the Argentinian still draws and is working on a film. His message: Laughing, "Because there's too much sorrow in the world." Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4th August 1932 in Buenos Aires, the son of a Spanish immigrant. In his first years as an artist he struggled along as an illustrator for celebration cards, amongst other things - which frustrated him. "The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said. Following posts in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60s he finally got his breakthrough: when his cartoons were published in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" as well, and other leading magazines around the world. Even in China, Mordillo found many fans. The artist always let himself be inspired by cities. Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort around in his drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow. In the early morning, he sits at his drawing desk, still today according to his own statements, and works almost ten hours a day. On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his whimsical figures are still disseminated widely around the world. In addition, he has been working for six years on an animated film and a TV series with his figures. The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favourite animal in his drawings - who has a millipede as his nemesis. His figures are speaking for the first time in the 3D film, which should hit cinema screens in 2019. "I don't know exactly what they are going to say; it is odd for me," says Mordillo. The screenplay was not written by him. Therefore he is focussing rather on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is being produced without words.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön Mountains is today celebrating its 1200-year anniversary. The highlight of the festivities will be this Saturday and Sunday, with a Medieval festival. On these days, you should be able to experience grocers, guilds, merchants, vagrants or a Landsknecht camp in the town centre.
In the storm: pile-up on the A8: four injured Serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8: just shy of 30 vehicles were caught up in a mass collision. There are numerous people injured, kilometre-long queues - and rubberneckers. On the motorway between Stuttgart and Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured late on Thursday afternoon in a mass collision. According to initial police information, just shy of 30 vehicles, among which were probably also lorries, had crashed into each other during a storm at around 5pm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (in the rural district of Aichach-Friedberg). No information is initially available about the precise number of injured people. There are mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson. There was a big squad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident. The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich. A roughly 10-km long tailback formed in the direction travelling towards Munich. As an AZ journalist reports, there were massive disruptions in the opposite lane as well - due to numerous rubberneckers. The fire brigade noted down the registration numbers of the drivers, who are now expecting severe penalties. Shortly after 6.45pm, there was then a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing. A collision between a car transporter and a passenger car had occurred. A rescue helicopter was underway to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Company trials "comfort check-in" It is a moment that practically everyone has experienced at one time or another: without expecting it, you're sitting in the train asleep. Or one is buried deep in one's work and has just had a genius idea. And then: bang. The conductor comes and rudely awakens you, or tears the passenger from the midst of his workflow. Ticket inspection. But the days of being interrupted will soon be over. Deutsche Bahn is currently trialling conductorless ticket inspection. One simply uses one's mobile to confirm that one has taken one's seat, thereby validating the ticket. Trial operations are currently running on two lines. "If the service is well-received, we'll extend it. It will then probably be available at the beginning of next year on many additional long-distance lines across Germany," said a spokesperson for the railway. The railway is calling this conductorless ticket validation "Comfort Check-in." In order to use it, however, a few conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet. And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do already anyway. In addition, you have to have bought it over the Railway's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case. And lastly, you need a seat reservation. For "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on board the train and call up your ticket in "My Tickets." The trial customers will then see a button for electronic validation. The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is onboard the train and has occupied booked seat Y. If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger there with an already validated online ticket. So you can carry on sleeping, working, doing nothing. The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for customers, and one for the railway - which, in turn, should benefit passengers. "Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion, without having his/her ticket inspected by our on-train staff, simply checks in him/herself in the DB Navigator. This allows passengers to personalise their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, Director of Marketing at DB Fernverkehr. A second plus: "And our employees will have more time than they currently do to see to the needs of individual customers." Anyone who travels by train a lot knows that, alongside delays and missing your train, ticket inspection is one of the biggest annoyances. For often you yourself, or, in any case, one of your fellow passengers, doesn't have all the documentation on them that one needs to validate an online ticket. Either the credit card is missing, or the ID card, or some other document that one needs to show. The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or wider area and delays in one's own ticket getting checked, and ultimately it takes away the conductor's time to see to other matters. Only a small number of trial customers can use the new service as of yet. And only on the connections ICE 915, between Dortmund and Stuttgart, and ICE 912, between Stuttgart and Essen. Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie The Bit Galerie is moving people although it is still far from being built. But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009. There is barely anyone left indifferent to the matter. The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg." Whereas some say of the Bit Galerie, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or, "That would be really fantastic" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side we hear, "No-one needs that" (Siggi Betzen) or, put quite bluntly: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz). Whilst those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town, which would benefit the other businesses as well, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be haemorrhaged. In addition: The gallery is being planned for exactly the plot where the covered farmers' market is, where 13 direct sellers offer their products. When construction begins, that will be the end of that. The Galerie creators want to integrate a covered market into the new building - and, indeed, towards Beda Platz, with the possibility of sitting outside. Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the covered market for years now. Principally our eggs, but also, always with great pleasure, the delicious cakes of our rural women. We have also discovered the butcher's for ourselves. We hope that also while the Galerie is being built, but above all after, there will be the chance to maintain this offering. That's what they have in other cities too. The small covered market in Frankfurt, in particular, is interesting." Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers settle in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent. But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project." Eva Kilic: "Why a shopping palace in Bitburg? Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary. There are plenty of those in our city already. One sees, though, how many shop premises stand empty here - some for months and years. However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market. For after all, the goods on offer there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer, and are good value to boot. As you see, shop premises in shopping centres are only rented by big companies, because the rents there are often not tenable for retail traders. Shame - there are hardly any specialist shops left any more and those that are still around will then probably also disappear." Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a covered market doesn't match up for me. And the Galerie doesn't suit Bitburg. In particular: Where should the covered market go while construction is ongoing? The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term, if the Bit Galerie does actually arrive eventually. Or is the spectre of the Bit Galerie managing even ahead of time to drive all businesses out of Bitburg?" George Marquet: "It simply will not work. And a shopping centre that stands empty - no-one needs that either. In my opinion, it would be better to support a proper farmers' market, instead of this Galerie. But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the crazily large number - as I see it - of pointless construction projects in Bitburg If the covered market is destroyed, then another piece of culture will disappear."
Aldi is selling no more eggs for the time being This was announced by the corporate group. It is a purely precautionary measure, and beyond that, no adverse effects on health can be assumed, said the announcement. With immediate effect, only eggs that have been proven to test negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lice agent may be delivered to Aldi. With the move, Aldi wanted to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf encased By encasing the 301-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday's Rundschau). Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team, led by Nelson Artz, want to keep the logo and slogan a secret still, until Thursday. At the end of August, as the climax of the campaign, there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth. "Too beautiful for us, are you?" The campaign authors have been asking this, on posters on the Rhöndorf chapel, since yesterday. "We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, activated yesterday. "But we are using this initiative to get your attention. And to bring home that some things are better than they seem. In actual fact, we are firmly convinced that we, as residents of Bad Honnef, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our town." The initiative is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues. "A stand-alone pledge has to be formulated, one that lends the town an unmistakable unique selling point." Ultimately, it is in competition with other municipalities. The town of Bad Honnef has given itself a moderate five-figure amount for the costs of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reform in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August, the highest military council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps. So too this week. At first glance, a normal procedure. But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt. The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously, but rather in the Prime Minister's official residence. Taking part in the discussions chaired by the head of government were now also the five vice premiers, as well as the ministers for defence, the interior, justice, and foreign affairs. The civilians were thus in the majority in the YAS. The government is tightening the reins on the military. Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the marines were removed. Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals. Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt. As of this week in Ankara, trials are being held against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt. Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt at overthrow as a "gift from God," since it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces. But does Erdogan really have control over the army? At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters." There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other ways, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper. The big clean-up of the army and the security forces is continuing anyway. In the middle of July, Erdogan fired, by decree, an additional 7395 public servants, among whom were 2303 policeman and 546 soldiers. In doing so, it seems as if Erdogan has tamed the military. Previously, the generals were deemed the true authorities in the country. Three times they staged a coup, invoking their role as guardians of the secular state order. After an election victory in 2002, Erdogan has been pushing back the strength of the military bit by bit, not least by invoking the reform guidelines of the European Union. Former officers say that Erdogan is purposefully promoting Islamisation of the armed forces. In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup out of fear of persecution, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years. If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development. In any case, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army's readiness for action. The governance structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say Nato diplomats.
Minister wants line renovated for Rennsteig shuttle In recent months, there have been constant arguments about the future of the Rennsteig shuttle - now it is said to be moving very quickly. There are plans to build on the dilapidated stretch of track, on which the tourist trains travel, before the end of the year still. In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle, construction works should begin on the line this year already, according to reports from the Ministry of Transport. "In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renovate the Ilmnau-Rennsteig line, the state acknowledges that this is an important connection, above all for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt. He estimated the costs for the repairs to the line to be around 2.5 million euros. The state is taking on 75 per cent of this amount. The contract, on the basis of which, the shuttle is to be commissioned by the state in the future as well, is currently being finalised, explained Sühl. The ministry and Süd-Thüringen Bahn, as operators, are said to already be in agreement over the technical details. "The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated," said Sühl. The planned contract between the ministry and the train company is being concluded for a period of eleven years. The Rennsteig shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017. The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, beloved above all by tourists. In past months, as part of a pilot operation, there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future. The line is very run-down in places.
When farmer Arnold found a curious egg As the last amongst the schools in Blumberg, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were let go for the holidays and sent forth for secondary schools. Three of the graduating students will be going to the Gymnasium secondary school, and four to the Realschule. School headteacher Angelika Sitte greeted parents and public representatives in the Biesental community centre in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening. As a symbol for the school graduation, the 29 students from the fourth grade, under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose an eagle that is growing up in the chicken yard, but will be then released into the wild. Added to this, the lively bunch performed a musical with the title "The Eagle in the Chicken Yard." Farmer Arnold found a curious egg and had his chickens hatch it. Instead of a chick, a small eagle emerged. Yet hopes of making a chicken out of it were dashed; the eagle spread its wings out on a high mountain and vanished. Afterwards, grades three and four performed a chicken dance, staged by Yvonne Frank. The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who were wearing top hats. The eagle stands for integration, said headteacher Angelika Sitte. The young animals may well be different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs amongst them. Though it will never be like a chicken. It is its destiny to be free. She wished for every fourth grader that he/she would feel accepted in his/her new school. There followed a word of thanks to her colleagues, the former headteacher Michael Müller, who is always filling in when there are teacher shortages, and the parent representatives. The time as chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher. She releases her students only very reluctantly, after two years of teaching, for it has been a really fantastic time. In the end, she was able to depend on the fourth graders. To close, all the students raised a song, with Summertime and Holiday Time. That brought out a lot of joy from the children. There are already eight first graders registered for the new school year.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know How exactly is the software update taking place? Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative? The most important questions and answers at a glance. At the Diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total. They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars classed under Euro emissions standard 5, and, some under Euro 6. Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded. Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment: Is the new initiative compulsory? No, the brokered software updates are voluntary. "The compulsory updates prior to this apply only to vehicles that have emissions test scamming software," says Anja Smetanin. The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered that they be retrofitted. How and from when are customers being notified of updates? The manufacturers have announced that there will be swift implementation in the coming months, but have not specified any precise deadline yet. Daimler has advised those affected to write to them. If an inspection is due anyway, this will be settled during the course of that. How long are the retrofittings likely to drag on for altogether? "Difficult to say," says Smetatnin. It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure. "For we have seen that thus far, car manufacturers have not been acting of their own accord when it comes to matters of the environment." How long should the update last? The retrofitting itself could last only three to four hours in the garage. It could be more laborious getting an appointment. What do car drivers do who don't drive a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel or the VW Group? The ACE advises waiting. Foreign manufacturers would apparently follow suit, said Smetanin. Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars? The ACE fears that. But just in those regions where there are threats of driving bans. In rural areas, there have as yet been no drops in value for older diesel cars. The ACE advises still waiting before selling.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center honours The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington. The first honours ceremony under President Trump promises to get political. One of the award winners does not want to come - out of protest. LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center. As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday, singers Gloria Estefan (59) and Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among those being honoured. The awards are handed over at the beginning of December. As is tradition, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and will take part in the presentation of awards, together with his wife Melania. For this reason, the award-winner Lear, made famous by a series of TV shows, already announced that he would not be attending the gala. He said to the "New York Times": "This presidency has decided to completely turn its back on the arts and human rights - even take funding away from them - and that upsets me." The 59-year old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear. The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the biggest cultural establishment in the US capital. Former prizewinners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We're making the city liveable Roland Wacker, municipal architect in Haslach, is going into retirement next year. The post has already been advertised - suitable applicants, though, are few and far between. Wacker has been municipal architect for 31 years. And he still finds the work a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press meeting. He reports of varied, but also demanding, tasks that await his successors. At the same time, it surprises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile. The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible opportunity. This should then allow enough time for induction training - observing usual notice periods. As Haslach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations, applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications. For the town wants to maintain this role at all costs. If it could no longer fulfil it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice. But accessibility for citizens is important to the town and to him too, says Wacker, who reports of a good working atmosphere and a cheerful mood between authorities and citizens. In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has amassed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride. "We're making the city liveable," is something he is certain of, re: the building authorities and his colleagues. But in the future too, there are diverse projects on the agenda: the redesign of a former Hukla plot and of the Niederhofen carpark, for example, have been initiated. The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and refurbishment of the stadium is still a topic. The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros "if we do it properly," estimates Wacker. "All in all, there are great tasks awaiting my successor. The work here is fun." There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect. With Haslach's own building yard and garden nursery, there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility. "One can affect a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned with praise by citizens and visitors. Since the old town as a whole has protected building status, it is important "to have an eye for what fits in" if new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing municipal architect. In any case, the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility. He is master of construction: "In the end, everything here passes by my desk." For support and coordination, he can count on years-old colleagues: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been there ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering), already 15 years. Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay." For continuity is important not only for a good working atmosphere, but also for the future design of the city. Anyone who wishes to take over from Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as graduate engineer or a bachelors degree with a specialisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws. The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering, urban land-use planning, land acquisition affairs, management of municipal property, the municipal depot with building yard and city nursery, and the lower board of building regulations, including preservation of sites of historic interest.
Bicycle thrown onto cables: southern railway closed According to police, the as-of-yet unknown perpetrator had thrown the blue bicycle onto the cables from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116). These were so badly damaged in the course of this that the approaching freight train had to be stopped. Investigators are proceeding on the assumption that there were two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since last night. A pink scooter and bicyclist were observed near to the scene of the incident by witnesses. "This goes far beyond a roguish prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA. The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger. In addition to the damage to the locomotive and facilities, as well as the time in delays and the costs for the rail replacement services, the perpetrators could also be faced with railway customers' penalty fees. Altogether, one can expect a "considerable" sum, said the spokesman. The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and the rail traffic on the southern railway stretch was able to be operated without obstructions. Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday afternoon, two of them were long-distance trains. Freight trains were not cancelled, although they were delayed. According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced. Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky The US aeroplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky. The pilots departed from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the outline began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and drew the shape of a Dreamliner over the USA - that's thousands of kilometres. The campaign lasted 18 hours and one minute. The shape of a Dreamliner could be seen on radar screens. The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines. Boeing hat already carried out such a promotion before. The number "787" was painted in the sky, along with the Boeing logo.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked, with a certain alarm, to Berlin before elections. No disturbances from party headquarters, no opposing winds from the state - that was the campaigners' biggest wish. Since Martin Schulz has been leading the party, that has fundamentally changed. Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror. What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, you couldn't even begin to describe as an opposing wind. Those were low blows. And one after the other at that. After the surprising end to the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general sign of a move away from coalitions of SPD and Greens. "This once again shows that Red-Green simply can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND). The surprise resignation of a Green representative plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a stark crisis. Five months ahead of the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost their one-vote majority over the opposition made up of CDU and FDP. The national head of the Greens, Michael Kellner, has called on defecting Green representative in Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to give up her seat. The cross-over to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the voters' will. Elke Twesten must immediately give up her seat," said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND). "It just can't be true," sighed an SPD campaigner, when the bad news reached party headquarters on Friday afternoon. Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is left without a governing majority after the cross-over of Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU. It is the present crisis in a long line of big and small disasters in SPD state associations. And no-one knows what is coming next. The misery began with the unexpectedly decisive defeat in the Saarland election in March. A black eye, no more, his comrades contented themselves at the time. After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything was going to be different. And it was too - in fact, everything was significantly worse. The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tailspin, and the Düsseldorf washout bowled the party clean over. Their peers then picked themselves up again in the weeks afterwards, with some effort. Then, just as they had regained new faith, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg. And with that came the next low blow. Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD regional leader, lost his halo that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic hall while his city was burning. And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong. Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival. And now Stephan Weil too. Thanks to the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been facing criticism for some time. Lousy poll results added to that. Despite that, or perhaps precisely because of that, Weil has been attempting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government. The former mayor of Hanover's attempts to build up his power in Berlin have not gone unnoticed by peers in Martin Schulz's entourage. They used to let him do as he liked, since they expected Weil to be a stabilising force for the party. Now, just the opposite may happen. In actual fact, Weil is not to blame for the Lower Saxony Greens' party-internal strife. And Schulz is certainly not. For the time being, therefore, their peers are taking pains to keep their ranks closed. Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, at the defecting parliamentarian Twesten. "It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND). Ms Twesten was voted into parliament not for her person, as a direct candidate, but on a Lower Saxony Green Party ticket, continued the Lower Saxony member of parliament. The logical conclusion would be for her to give up her seat. Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplored the "undemocratic manoeuvre." "The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who as frontrunner is leading the Lower Saxony SPD into the Bundestag elections, to the RND. "Now the personal career notions of a future CDU representative is distorting the electoral result," continued Oppermann. He called for light to be shed on the circumstances surrounding the matter. I want to know whether there was anything more there, or if additional commitments were made to the Lower Saxony CDU.
Grant money for Town Centre III Anyone who wants to renovate their outdated house will soon be able to get support from the state. Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives for STEG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Empfingen. At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once more cast a glimpse back to what has been the case so far. Since 1991, there have been regeneration areas in Empfingen. Back then, in regeneration area I, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount. From 2005 to 2016, in regeneration area II, the subsidy still lay at 60 per cent. For Schindler, the refurbishments up until this point have been a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to support interior development too, and not only develop new construction areas. On 4th April, word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a regeneration area III. The grant amount is 833,333 euros, of which, 500,000 euros is to come from the federal state, the rest, from the municipality of Emfingen. How does a regeneration area come about? One will investigate, explains Schindler further, where the "truly old" houses are. What also comes into play, however, is whether there is even any interest to renovate in the planned area at all. If necessary, the area boundaries can also then be shifted again. STEG was represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel. Keller presented the content of the government and federal state "Soziale Stadt" programme, within whose scope the refurbishments would then be implemented. The core of the programme is the revitalisation of town centres, the improvement of living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure. The measures would be implemented on a property-specific, that is, per-premises, basis. The regeneration area would then ultimately be laid down as statute. The appropriation period for the subsidies has been running from 1st January 2017 and will continue to do so until 30th April 2026. First, however, stocktaking will be carried out until September of this year, as part of which, those with a stake in the regeneration area will receive a survey to fill out. The resolution should preferably follow in November or December, so that refurbishments can be begun next year. Pietzschmann then explained that every community must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies. It's about assessing the shortcomings in the urban design and deciding what will be renovated and to what extent. A renovation comment will then be recorded in the land registry for each premises. Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again himself and get an idea of the location, he promised. Gotzel stressed that the participation of those involved is an essential factor for the project's success. That is why there will be surveys, which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays. The yellow survey is the "building and property survey," which is about, among other things, the structural condition and the intentions for refurbishment. In the grey survey, the "budget and housing survey," information can be provided on the size, breakdown and residents of a living space. The blue "business survey" is only filled out if business premises operate in the building. It should be noted, however, Gotzel pointed out, that a filled-out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money. What is more, new building initiatives are not eligible for funding. Schindler also stressed that funding would be allocated on a "first-come, first-served" basis - the early bird gets the worm. It is not possible to "reserve" grant money for later. To conclude, photos of the "Town Centre II" project were shown, to "sell" the idea of refurbishment to those present.
TC BW Neuss faces tricky task Front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is competing at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV. TC Blau-Weiss Neuss is competing tomorrow in Kiel, from 11am, at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV. Despite still flawless results after five matches, the front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is maintaining a sense of reality. Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent at any rate. "This is a compact team that always plays in very similar formation. In the back positions, in particular, I find the team very good." It is above all the imports from the high north that bring class and stability to Suchsdorfer SV. "Their Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup appearances. And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark). "It will be difficult for us, as always. You need a good dose of luck as well." The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practically set. Maxime Janvier could give his debut for Blau-Weiß. If the Frenchman, currently still active in the challenger tournament in Italian Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, then Zdenek Kolar (Czech), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will be called into action for the first time this season. The as yet undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still hitting balls with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday. He should also be there in Kiel though, just like Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina. After his two victories last Sunday against the Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move back into the team. If that's not enough for the 18-year-old from Hungary, who in January 2016 was still number one in the junior world rankings, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill out the squad.
How America can harm OMV Donald Trump didn't exactly look happy on Wednesday evening as he placed his signature under a bill that would see sanctions against Russia strengthened. "In its haste to pass this legislation," Congress packed in some "unconstitutional provisions," he griped. The reaction from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels seethed at the US motion. After all, the bill plans to penalise European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU. Ever since, investors in Austria's OMV, which together with other European companies has co-financed the construction of Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been accordingdly perturbed. The threat is enormous. Nevertheless, it is too early to gauge the consequences, according to the official statement from the Oil group. In reality, Donald Trump would still have to put the sanctions into being himself through an executive order. He has twelve weapons to choose from here. "The press" has set out to see what the group could fight off and what could really do it harm.
Roll back in time: the city employs 46 kitchen assistants The city is once more organising the nursery lunch itself. With designated contact persons for the children and place in the team. The clock is being turned back in the city's nurseries. On the 1st September, the city of Krefeld is once more taking the catering in the city's nurseries (Kitas) into its own hands. For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare services department, this is good news: "We were all delighted." The cooking is still done off premises: a caterer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled food. The city operates 46 nurseries in the district of Krefeld; in 44 of these, the children get a warm meal at midday. In the last nursery year, 2800 children sat at the tables in each case, and demand is growing steadily. "By now, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week that eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz. "The service is also available for the 35-hour care option, when children stay until 2pm." 46 part-time staff are on kitchen duty on 1st September: they warm up the delivered meals, supplement them with salad, crudités and fruit, put the meals into individual portions, hand out the food, clear up, wash up and clean the kitchen. "The workers are assigned to a fixed Kita," says Pommeranz. The size - there are two-group and seven-group establishments - dictates the number of hours worked. "The kitchen assistants now firmly belong in the Kita team," says Pommeranz contentedly. "That way they are much more closely involved, and it is easier for the nursery head to put educational concepts in place." Because it's about this too: a healthy diet and cooking lessons. "The children should help prepare the food." Directly linking the kitchen staff to the team makes sense then. For the children too. "They have a known staff member in the Kita, someone who is familiar to them, and not people who are continuously changing." This continuity is important for the children. The cleaning of the nursery rooms - up until now also a task for the kitchen staff - will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel. This option - the separation of cleaning and the kitchen service - not only improves the quality of the kitchen's output, but also has the appeal of having turned out to be the most economical option for the city when comparing costs between in-house and outsourcing, said the press office. And that is despite 46 new part-time staff being employed. "But these hours don't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.

Men attempt to mug 13-year-old girl Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday. According to information from police, the men approached the 13-year-old girl, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at around 2.55pm, because they wanted to use the girl's mobile to make a phone call. The 13-year-old refused their request and carried on walking with her friends. One of the perpetrators then attempted to snatch the mobile and the girl's necklace, but was unsuccessful. The duo then fled without their loot. Both young men were later arrested by the police. Investigations are underway.

Police are seeking witnesses in relation to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and grazed the crash barrier. On Thursday evening, at around 7.55pm, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was en route in his VW on the B215 coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese. In the region of the Stolzenau bypass, a passenger car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right. In doing so, the Touran driver grazed the crash barrier. The car suffered material damage. The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without concerning himself with the traffic accident. According to information provided by the victim of the accident, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all. The police are now appealing for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident to get in touch with Stolzenau Police Station via the telephone number 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger" The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger. That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says. The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still causing debate. After its publication, Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedikt XVI. It would be of great service to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret over their own failures or their false assessments of events back then. The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Domspatzen using "double standards." With respect to the assaults in Regensburg, no-one doubts that these were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future; however, what was striking was the "level of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee. "The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is now a part of our everyday experience and sets up public opinion for considering that as normal," writes Scaraffia. Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio that "people love to let loose on the Church, and it is an easy target." She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with cheeky children, of which I was one." She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed. In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger cropped up a lot. Absolutely unfair, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who together with Ratzinger compiled the commemorative volume "My Brother, the Pope" (translated into 12 languages). "I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, for in his assessment, the result of the final report "has nothing to do with him." What exactly is in the 440-page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg, has produced? In total, 547 members of the Regensburger Domspatzen were "highly likely" the victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused. The final report said of Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, that "in summary, it can be determined that forms of corporal and physical violence were used by the cathedral's Master of Music R. in many cases." When he was highly emotional, in particular, the punishment for the students could be a lot more severe. Despite this, it is apparent that, in contrast to numerous others of the accused, many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence." Hesemann explains in the interview why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger. For Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger. On the one hand, many students stress his "humaneness." On the other hand, he also comes across as a choleric type and perfectionist, who would often turn to violence if one of the Domspatzen didn't give a top musical performance. How do you judge this final report as his biography? Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort and reads the entire 440-page-long report from start to finish, one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Ratzinger is doing in there at all. Eight pages are devoted to him, all in one go, and he is clearly exculpated from every suspicion of complicity or connivance in the terrible cases of sexual abuse. The extreme acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of activity. At best, one can accuse him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough. The Domspatzen secondary school, where he was active, was perceived by practically all of those asked as - to quote - "salvation," "heaven" and a "better world." So, the vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger a quite glowing testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted," "beloved," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provide the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always mobbed by clusters of children." Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which from time to time also led to outbursts of anger. The fact that during the course of this he not only banged chairs and threw his bunch of keys to the floor, but even handed out slaps around the face and pulled on the hair or ears of all-too-impudent boys is something that he himself already admitted years ago, that he deeply regrets and apologises for. In his defence, however, it must also be said that such methods of education in that questionable period between the 1960s and 1970s were wide-spread amongst parents as well as teachers. Do you remember such castigation methods? I'm thinking of those of us who were born before 1968, of course. I too experienced that, in a secular school, too, a state Gymnasium. Compared to what this report is actually about, namely, appalling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at preschool, these are of course mere trifles. So one cannot help but ask whether the fact that lots of media are bearing down on him in particular does not have more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI. Indeed, lots of people are still slaving away assiduously on the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him. But the truth is: the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every way! In the media, there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report. Is Georg Ratzinger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complicity in respect of sexual abuse? Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly not. Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have confided in the cathedral's Master of Music. Not once were the parents brought in the loop. "I never dared talk about it with my father or my mother," said one of those affected, as a representative for the others, "It was always very embarrassing for me." But the real problem when it comes to throwing light on sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims stay silent out of shame. If they don't even confide in parents and siblings, then they for sure are not going to to a choir leader, who after all had been a professional colleague, as it were, of the perpetrators. How do the Domspatzen schoolboys judge Ratzinger's role in respect of the cases of abuse? Michael Hesemann: One pupil asked put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators in question. I also think... it is quite absurd to assume that... boys opened up more emphatically or clearly or even sooner to him, of all people, than to their parents, the heads of their boarding houses, mentors etc. That one would speak with him about sex... - unthinkable." So, the report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "That affected pupils and/or those around them confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has therefore been absolved of any complicity. Therefore, he can also not be accused of not having stopped it or reported it. There is therefore also no reason to bring his good name into association with this despicable crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases. In the media, one read a lot about "extreme acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen. The former cathedral Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report of "turning a blind eye." Does he have to live with this accusation then? Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed up and confounded into a huge melange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and somewhere, in the middle of that, was Georg Ratzinger. But precisely that, in turn, is an abuse of the report. That is to say, there is a clean separation there: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and acts of violence as well as, shall we say, other accusations. What is more, the report handles cases from the period since 1945, that is, from four decades, as well, when Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen. The whole hideous educational theory of spanking, the cases where boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers, and from which they suffered terribly, all of these took place in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed. Yet the cathedral's Master of Music Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with these, for he first set eyes on the boys when they were already at the Domspatzen secondary school. There, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the topic of the "preschool" was taboo. One was only happy to have got away from it and enjoyed the much better treatment and the conditions that were even "paradisiacal" for many. What was different at the Domspatzen secondary school then? Michael Hesemann: Discipline still ruled there, sure, but there was no sadistic violence. And that applies to Georg Ratzinger likewise, in relation to whom the report concludes that "many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence." So, at best, there remains the accusation of having turned a blind eye. Yet despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was given reports about the conditions at the preschool. The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible (according to the witness), and then next only in around 1993. Did Georg Ratzinger systematically close his ears to the conditions? Michael Hesemann: No, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen secondary school, which was even reproduced in the report. In that, he pointed this out, "that in the preschool corporal punishment is still practised." Even when facing the risk of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention. That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too. Before that, it was taking place in a legal grey zone, as every one of us well knows. So it was also difficult for him to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerating or dramatising and where the permissible limits had really been overstepped. But one cannot say that he always turned a blind eye. That is simply not true. It was first in 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well. Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis indeed asserts that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that earlier time. What is your opinion on this? Michael Hesemann: We historians talk here about "the pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards. The Princess is quite right here. But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was despicable at all times, and also not to that which was perpetrated in the preschool in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then. That is all absolutely terrible and I am glad that it is finally being looked into. But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him. His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, slapping around the face and pulling the hair and ears, was widespread in the 1970s. When corporal punishment was then banned, he complied strictly with that too. What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect then in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother, the Pope"? Did the subject of corporal punishment ever come up? Michael Hesemann: Look, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedikt XVI., told from his perspective, so the Domspatzen played only a subsidiary role. Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he ran a strict regime there. But this too has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to forge from the Regensburger Domspatzen - up until that point famous rather on a national level - a world-class institution, a cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, that twice a-piece went on tour to the USA (1983 and 1987) and to Japan (1988 and 1991). Not with biscuits and sweets alone does one all at once turn insubordinate boys into great singers, and face every success, regardless of the area, but rather, with continuous discipline, passion and self-conquest. What kind of impression did you get of Georg Ratzinger the man then in those conversations for your book? Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really very well, and my experience of him was always as a wonderful, humorous, totally benevolent, deeply devout and good-hearted man, who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hurting a fly. I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still today keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family. Those who up until today still do not forgive him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority. Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them nearer to the world of music. And for always being a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may well be - but also a loving person, to be respected, whom they still look up to today and downright worship. And please, once more, just to be clear: all that he is accused of are methods of education, that back then were order of the day. We can be glad that we have long overcome this time. But it is highly unjust to make a media scapegoat out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother. The evil intention behind that is all too obvious. For the report that was just published exonerates him. Now one would ask for the decency to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has rendered great service and without whom probably no-one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Regensburger Domspatzen
