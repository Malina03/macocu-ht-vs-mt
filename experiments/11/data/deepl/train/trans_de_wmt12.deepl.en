Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level Sensitively and generously, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A History of the First World War, Told in Nineteen Fates" with a long list of main characters that gets to your heart. Here's a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark. You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel-like narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, your lighthouse in those few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions. Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature. He has written an unusual book, which he not inaccurately describes as "a work of anti-history." It contains few big names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions of tactics and equipment. It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods." "Beauty and Horror" almost sums up the war experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers. Some of these people become heroes. Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die. Each of these lives flares up like votive candles in a church, some added while others go out. Englund's book departs from the usual history books. It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front. "Beauty and Horror" wanders over other theatres of war with an expert's eye: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa. Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem. This is a moving book almost from the start. War floods these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordite. Imagine you are a woman at home with your children, hearing cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you take flight? Who is coming in the first place? Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being fought at all. "Missing facts," Englund notes, "have been padded out with suppositions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours." "Beauty and Horror" follows individual characters such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor. Their stories were mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other previously published material. Their life stories can be harrowing or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in Englund's collection of small moments lost in detail. Many of them are about deprivation and making do. In the story of a German schoolgirl he tells, "Ersatz, überall Ersatz." "Substitute coffee, fake aluminium, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons." He tells more of the substitute food in Germany. He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and served last with a fake bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes soled with wood." There were, he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the making of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes." Some stories are about honour and bravery. One American recognises his own urge to savagery and says of war: "One feels that, in spite of everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in an armchair with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and pretending that such a façade meant civilisation and that there was no barbarism behind one's starched and shod shirt-front." Conversely, a British soldier realises that he will probably die and no one will take any notice or care. "When you step back from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you would like to think that it is done in front of an audience," he writes. Instead, it is as horrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret." Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new kinds of terror. "The conflict increasingly became an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between factories." He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still-young century: the word-savvy and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailored suit, slaughtering while sitting behind a desk." People behave in unpredictable ways and there is frivolous behaviour as well as heroism. Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract venereal disease from a prostitute to escape frontline service. "The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade in gonococcal pus, for soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of thus getting to hospital," he writes. "Those who were really desperate rubbed it into their eyes, which resulted in them being blind for the rest of their lives." In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive, perfectly suited to his human task. In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred." People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight. The best books on the First World War have usually been spoofs like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West rather than comprehensive history books. Englund's volume joins an unconventional hall of fame. His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read about in non-fiction. I'm not giving it away again. But it's as if his book snatched that page of main characters from under our noses and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets. It had been decided to take place on Monday night because there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time. The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed they were taking part in an exercise. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges. The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which was against the department's rules and gave the squatters a huge boost in public sympathy, were not allowed to happen again. And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training. Officers had prepared this by observing how occupations were handled in other cities. A disaster drill had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island. Officers stepped up so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures that include the rapid redeployment of large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan. The latest training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River. The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which argued for declaring it an "exercise." "The few police officers that I know were involved didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wished to remain anonymous. "The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials in the department." One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned. On 14 October, officials planned to clear the park, but then backed away when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of those plans. Officers from various police forces were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers normally deployed in high-crime neighbourhoods. Mr Kelly said there were many people coming in and out of the park during the day, almost like commuters, so 1am was a good time to go in. "It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said. Ambulances with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were lined up before leaving at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge. The lights and pre-recorded messages blaring from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters. As public officials in their bright blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left. Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45am to give protesters time to pack up their belongings. Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests be necessary in the park. Reporters were forced to leave the park. Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety. But many journalists claim they were prevented from observing police actions in the park. And they said the officers' interaction was very rough. Mr Browne said television vans could have taken photographs in Church Street on the west side of the park. As police moved west through the large jumble of protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, they were followed by city sanitation workers who picked up what had been left behind. Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the internet shortly afterwards. A main core of protesters took up positions near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park. Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests. About 10 people at the epicentre of the camp chained themselves together by their arms. And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said. Civil Protection officials were called in to cut them loose. As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30am. The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to police. Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park. Most of the arrests, he said, were for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest." The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department's chief, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer. Phil T. Pulaski, division chief of detectives, was also there. Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "did not direct" the operation, Mr Browne said. In case they should seize, a second group of officers was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets. Barricades were set up on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south. Police could be observed extending the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park from these locations. At one location, several officers, many of them carrying shields, were observed herding people outside. Approximately 28 people were in the northern perimeter. Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park. Around 5am, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters deflated the tyre of a police bus. At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood. In the end, one officer and one protester were hospitalised.
Caregivers' union to file lawsuit against city over layoffs The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their undue impact on schools that teach poor students. The lawsuit is likely the last option open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs. Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's lowest-paid employees, lost their jobs on 7 October in a move union leaders described as political payback for denying the city access last year to a health fund that the labour groups maintained was intended to help close the budget gap. This accusation was categorically denied by the authorities. At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June. A council member shot back, telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff would be laid off. Council 37 officials said they had and warned the education department not to sue. There will be a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit in Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Board of Education as defendants and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of colour or Latino, as are most of the aides who lost their jobs. Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city does not have the lawsuit and thus cannot comment on its individual allegations. According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's poor neighbourhoods to support a claim of unequal treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more aides because they are chronically underfunded. She submits that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides were lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 aides were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx. Noting the loss of five of eight school aides employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts." P.S.: The 36th District budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrolment. The union also complains that high school principals were misled by language in a memo that authorised the dismissal of care coordinators. The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the US usually describes moving a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office. "Sixty-six care coordinators were laid off, not transferred," the draft lawsuit says.
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to come to an understanding regarding Libya In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already coming to an understanding regarding the uprisings in Libya. All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and an end to American interference. On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution, reporting to Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage." "This resolution honours the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said. "It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts." The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libya debate. This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the US military's role in NATO's Libya mission. In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorising the limited use of US military forces in Libya. The bill was defeated in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and no vote was taken. But on the same day, this bill failed in the Senate. The House also overruled a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya. This plunged the US mission into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was upset enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug out from under him for good. Then Congress's indecision was overtaken by events. Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. Now the Senate may be ready to act. The International Relations Committee resolution "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who are supporting military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism." The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy." Will the new measures get full support from the Foreign Relations panel or will they divide lawmakers as the June bill did? The latest version faces opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican. Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill. According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats. The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to come up for a vote in the Senate or Congress at this time. Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to a vote, although they have tried often enough. Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to this Congress, covering a whole range of issues. Some are duplicative - the same bill has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly. There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending." Some of the bills are also identical, but they give their principals - especially rookies in the Republicans who want to burnish their resumes - the opportunity to brag that they "authored" such a measure. The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to balance the budget. In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment. Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the two-term limit on the president. Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care. An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a recurring bill, as is an amendment banning flag burning. Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states reject them. As eager as members are to propose amendments, they are moving at an uneven pace as in years past. In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress, 66. The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library. But they were not much more successful than today's either. The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit but not beaten," Giffords says in first TV interview after assassination Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range during a Tucson election rally, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than that to return to Congress. When she appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, she struggled for words and needed help walking. The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and passed through her head from front to back. Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake. In her first television interview after the January attack that killed six people and injured 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult." When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford, 41, replied, "Pretty good." The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special recorded just before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope." The special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack. In videos recorded by Kelly in the early weeks, she is seen in a hospital bed, her head shaved bald and a long scarf over her forehead. She can only lift a finger or two when her husband encourages her to do so. Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements. A nod of the head. A twitch of the lips. And then, her first words, "What." After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed. Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'." In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she doesn't remember the day of the assassination. Her husband said he had been reading Giffords a daily newspaper article about the assassination on 12 March when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the attack. Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is incarcerated in a Missouri jail receiving forced medical treatment while he awaits trial. "A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer. "Hard, hard, hard." In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer recounted, she said, "I got hit." "So, I would say, "Gabby, you didn't get hit?" said Kelly. "You just got hit. And you're going to get through this and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel pity rather than respect The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss. On cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him. The crowd in black dinner jackets stood and applauded. "The servicemen and servicewomen were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraiser in the spring. A senior military officer at the gala, watched by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the troops' role differently. "They were ushered in like orphans," the officer wrote in an email. I am sure the organisers meant well. I know that. But it wasn't respect, really. It was pity. The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly detached, sometimes admiring American public. The troops are showered with praise for their sacrifices. But the praise comes at a price, service members say. The public increasingly behaves as if it feels sorry for those in uniform. "We were not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. "But apparently the only way of support is to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls." The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve. They have also recognised that the anger that returned troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse. As a result, conversations about compassion are taking place quietly and privately between war veterans. After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world might see their service from two different perspectives. Some would view them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places. Others would wonder if there was an "angry, violent veteran hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took a senior state post in Washington on his return. During his job search, he said, he sensed some of the interviewers subtly questioning whether he would be able to withstand the pressures of a demanding post in Washington immediately after returning from combat. "When you talk about your service, you have to counter the negative impressions," Cancian told his sons. The military's lack of levity is rooted in part in Americans' lack of interest in war. Achievements on the battlefield are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "We as a nation don't value military heroism the way we absolutely did in World War II," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan. Instead, most of the praise from politicians and the public focuses on the suffering of a service member. Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be tried in military courts for failing to intervene in a rape. If it doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are in line for the next hearing. Lance Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier. It was October 2008 and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend when she encountered a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer. He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink. "My alarm bells went off," Lyman said. But the Texan brushed aside her concerns. "I thought, 'Oh come on, he's 19, he's from Texas,'" she said. "I wish I'd listened to my gut." A few minutes after they went up to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims. This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed to stand trial. The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread rape within the military and in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights. Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the suit initially included 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the months that followed: 25 women and three men, all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide adequate jurisdiction after the alleged assaults, Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership because that is where the problem begins. "The military is hierarchical," she says. "Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership." Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits. Her strategy: rather than all plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will file many more lawsuits, if necessary, to keep up the pressure. The defence team for the Ministry of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case. The court filings, available to Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries that occurred in the armed forces. Because of a 1950 Supreme Court law known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers. "The alleged injuries occurred while the plaintiffs were in military service," the document says. The Ministry of Defence refuses to comment for this story. Things have changed since the 1950s. If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in making contact with local women in the war zones. The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat. It is time for the military to modernise, says Burke. And she is not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending. At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere. Separately, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the "personality disorder" diagnosis that rape victims received in order to discharge them from service - a common practice according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group. Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of benefit claims for people who said they had been sexually assaulted in the service. Nine bills were independently submitted to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, offering a range of evidence. In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported, according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. But most abuses are not reported at all, and by the Pentagon's own estimate, that number takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year. The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military went to trial, only half as many as in civilian law. The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe her attacks as just the first in a series of traumas. In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the assault. That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a host of police officers, doctors and commanders. She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During that hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault. Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted. "I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says. "I thought I was going into labour. I ran screaming out of the courtroom." "They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came back out I said to my commanding officer, 'This wasn't his trial. That was my procedure." Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed her with a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service. She was dishonourably discharged in January 2010, leaving her without any support. Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed will move forward is anyone's guess, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School. Still, he notes, "In my view, they should move forward." What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first questioned. I have been a critic of the Feres doctrine all my life. The military is a decade behind because they don't have the same incentive and the same deterrence that liability brings. He adds, "The odds are against them.... But it's important for them to try." These things will only change if good people are willing to fight. If the hearing doesn't go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases. "We will continue to fight the military on this issue until there is reform," she says. Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook Before he became the new face of far-right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys broadcasting their anti-immigration views online. On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to going on a rampage in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court. While Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of the time leading up to his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites. After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people. But how do you find them? It's easy - all you have to do is log on to Facebook. "We found that it wasn't hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report on digital populism in Europe by the British think tank DEMOS. Facebook's stash of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographics with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have done for years. Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the adds invited users to take a survey asking about their level of education, attitude towards violence and how they felt about their own future. Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their offices. "It's quite a new research method," says Bartlett. Some of the findings are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration . But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens." DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists. Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as seen in "likes," text messages and status updates. With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with the site's name in the title increase by nearly 800% in the past five years. For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through the site you can study people you wouldn't normally reach with your clipboard on the street. "In the past, if you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them." "You had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett. "Facebook removes all that - you go straight to them." Others say the site offers a way to identify and address social health issues. A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more likely to engage in problem drinking than students who remained silent about the issue. Moreno suggests that peer students, such as housing advisers, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates. "You can't solve a problem if you haven't identified it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post. "We found a way to identify vulnerable children who wouldn't have been found otherwise." Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population. The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to - digital freedom champions have long known that the site should open up its vast trove of data to others for research purposes). But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to dump your personal data. But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about? While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how they collect their data offline, anything goes online. "I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be studying their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study that looked at students' public pages on Facebook. "As far as they were concerned, it was all about them and their friends." Then there is the question of methodology. Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant will be completely honest. On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the statements in a user's profile and posts are true. "What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says. That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use. "There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says. "Social research has to be about the social - and lots of social life still happens offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for first time Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two rampages that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo. "I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he told a courtroom of more than 500 people. "I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideologies and because this supports multiculturalism." "I recognise the law, but I do not plead guilty." Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views." For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing. Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in pre-trial detention for 12 more weeks, saying he would not have access to the media for four weeks. He said authorities will closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing. Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he would remain behind bars. All attended with the goal that it all boils down to locking him away. "I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. "It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after seeing and hearing the suspect." Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building. Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices. It may please some that the 22 July attacks appear to have been the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals. But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion still felt by an entire nation? "I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the relative of one victim. "It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs shown in a theatre this week Following Steve Jobs' death on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, singling out the tech genius as a great modern inventor. But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, dusted off this week ahead of special screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows. He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser, busily tinkering with diagrams - a man who believed that many CEOs suffer from "a disease of thinking" that "a really great idea is 90 per cent of the work.... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craft between a great idea and a great product." In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Pundits" about the advent of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, during which they had one of those rare, in-depth conversations. By this time, more than 10 years had passed since Jobs had been forced out of Apple. And he was already hard at work on his new computer company, NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet. While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in punditry, he says the copy masters of the interview were missing when delivered. It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage. This slightly edited footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to Landmark theatres this Wednesday and Thursday. For someone known to loathe in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager here in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies. And incredibly thoughtful. Four times during the interview there are lengthy pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of musing, during which Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts and striving for accuracy. There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the fore, when he seems impatient with Cringely's questions and nudges him to move more quickly on issues or subplots of greater importance. Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, The Lost Interview somehow seems eerily prescient as Jobs assesses what he thinks other companies are doing right or wrong and presents his own vision for the future of computing. It's one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs' career. But to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the cusp of greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring. He has a vision of how things could and should be. Shortly after executing all this, he went out and did it. A quick look at seven remarkable sequences from The Lost Interview: How he learned to run a business: 'Throughout the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?." And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just the way it's done." Nobody knows why they do what they do. Nobody in business really thinks about things in depth. That's what I've found. Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple. Baffled by how costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs" figured on a mere guess and then adjusted with "variance" - he developed an automated factory that ensured business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail. How the Pope was made fun of: Jobs talks about the "blue box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free. Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm as he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is infectious. He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible. "We sent stuff around the globe half a dozen times and if you bawled into the phone, it would come out a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs says, chuckling. "We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world." Both of us, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think Apple would exist without it. Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank Wozniak and he almost pulled when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via blue box to talk to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could. With several members of the Catholic hierarchy being summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, they had to laugh it off before the Pope himself came on the phone. How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared): At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him. Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer. "That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I'd seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees." Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made. It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braunsch tube, and I fell in love with it. I would climb up to HP as a teenager and hang on to that machine and write programs for it. How to improve innovation: Several times in the interview Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly. Early in his career, when he was putting in some circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer. He was working with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices. Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had designing a computer mouse: "I remember resounding arguments.... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer." Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could get built for $15. That was incredibly believable. About big companies slacking off: Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stock. "Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?" They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful. Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's people like that] who end up running the companies and the product that people are pushed out of decision-making with. The product genius that led to this monopoly is being eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary. That's what happened with Xerox.... Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry. They could have been ten times bigger, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s.... They caught defeat from victory. On innovation as an art form: "There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... as you develop that great idea, it changes and grows." You learn a lot about your subtleties. You have to make tunings, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together.... Ultimately it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to look at the best stuff that people have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you do. Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. We are always shameless in stealing great ideas. Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world. If it hadn't been for the computer industry, they would be creating fantastic things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health care laws as court takes case On the day the Supreme Court convenes behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the court. The incident took place last Thursday when all nine justices met for a briefing to discuss petitions for consideration. One of the cases to be considered was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against sweeping health care reforms passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the US. The judges agreed to hear the case. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour fundamental debate is expected in March, the likely outcome of which will likely boost the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced. The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law should be overturned is likely to be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the George W. Bush administration. Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that sponsored the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles. Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that is challenging the law. Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the lawsuit. The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case. Among those on duty was Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican caucus leader and an avowed opponent of health care reform The dinner's guests? Scalia and Thomas. This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years. And that does not violate moral rules. In fact, judges exempt themselves from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges. If they were, they would arguably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising events of law-related and other organisations, provided that the judge shall not be a speaker, guest of honour or, according to the programme, a guest at any such event." Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas' extreme proximity to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm morality and government activists. "This stunning breach of morality and contradiction of the Code gives the lie to the complaints of some judges that the court was abiding by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US. "The judges won and dined during a fundraiser with lawyers with pending cases at the court." Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable. Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they too easily conflate court matters with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society. And the Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist. By contrast, conservatives claim that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas. Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal challenges came before the court in the first instance. Her critics urged Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying she was too committed to defending the law to be impartial. Kagan makes no move to do so.
Boeing lands record $18 trillion order Emirate airline orders 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s with an option for 20 more. Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion. It's rare news indeed for a company to get an order for 50 of its products. But it is a big deal when the company is aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 planes in total is a record $18 trillion. Boeing's client is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders. In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimated that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years. Boeing announced over the weekend its largest-ever commercial jet order by value: 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets. The hammer order came from Dubai-based airline Emirates. The airline also has, Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more planes, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion. Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which vastly improves fuel economy and passenger comfort. The list price for six of those planes is more than $1 trillion. "This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert. "The quality of these particular customers is very high." Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries. So they don't just have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines as it is one of their biggest costs, is not so damaging as the country earns from a higher oil price. This is important because they are less inclined than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said. "They have a natural hedge," he said. Emirates' order reaffirms Boeing's leadership in the widebody market and helps keep Airbus rival SAS at bay as it attacks supremacy with the A350. Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would delay the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. It postponed the launch to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range. Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan Luisa Maria Calderon claims drug trafficking opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI backed her in the race for governor. President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents. According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won the race for governor in the western state. "The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's election. "They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... They occupied polling booths, set up roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]." The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000. But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort. The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July. Vallejo appears to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had been leading in the polls before election day. Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner. Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), currently still the incumbent governor, came third, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless leftist leadership for the 2012 presidential election. Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results. Vallejo, former mayor of the capital Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results. Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines. It is President Calderon's home state and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006. The violence still continues. A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have dropped out of local elections out of fear. For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how odious the Michoacan elections seem. The man likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory makes us look boldly to the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in eurozone rescue The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help rescue the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy. Rajat Nag, administrative director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must do "everything in your power" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or direct reciprocal arrangements. He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "dispassionately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support from European leadership and resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy. "We are all in the same boat," he said. "So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. "Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune." "So if China and India can help, they can help by any means necessary." Europe's monetary union has been plunged into a severe debt crisis in recent months. In recent days Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned. The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to band together to support the eurozone. Mr Nag predicted that any support for Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said reciprocal arrangements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offered European partners in Asia greater bargaining power. Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows. "Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said. "We are facing big challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth." "It's not an option, it's a mandate, because where else are we going to find jobs for our millions of young men and women." Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges. Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at US-based Brown University, said it would be politically very hard to sell aid to Europe to India's 1.2 trillion people, more than 800 million of whom live on $2 a day or even less. "At some point they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said. Lee Howell, administrative director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to retain Greece's numerous and well-paid public sector employees, with jobs in poorly run, loss-making institutions such as the railways. Mr Nag said the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" across Asia. The ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia in 2011/is now "at risk of downgrade" because of the looming threat from Europe. He said vulnerable emerging markets need to draw up "contingency plans" to protect themselves for a downturn and a significant capital outflow from their word economies.
Urgent warnings from Pentagon over possible defence cuts Defence Secretary Leon Panetta fired up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security without being noticed. In doing so, he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines. The Pentagon is already mulling cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending. "The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called sequestration, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects. "Such a large cut, carried out in such an ill-advised manner, would make most of our ship and building projects infeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to senators. "We would also be forced to involuntarily part with much of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians to meet the goal." "These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness." The cuts were "ultimately going to hit combat troops," Panetta said. "While wartime contingents in the counter-terrorism fight would not be directly affected by sequestration, the serious encroachment on the base budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned. "Personnel hiring would be cut, resulting in delays in hiring and hiring oversight that support the war effort." "Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to war time traders, and both legal and political support would be disrupted." The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense. "The consequences of sequestering the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power." "We vehemently oppose this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter. "This is an outcome we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us." "Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be permitted." Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from senators will increase pressure for a compromise on the budget or strengthen calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen. Panetta has been increasingly blunt about the possible cuts, even though he had many years of budget experience in Congress and the White House before coming to head the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough choices. At a press conference last week, the defence secretary painted a grim picture of what could lie ahead - a military with a shell but no core. "It is a ship without sailors," he said. "It is a brigade without ammunition." "It is an air squadron without adequately trained pilots." "It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon. "It's a force that lacks morale, lacks alertness and lacks the ability to take on potential adversaries." "It actually makes you angry." In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict, and disaster, serious limitations on our worldwide deployment and intervention capability, resulting in unacceptable risk in future war operations." And Panetta said some of the biggest defence projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those already tested and in the early planning stages. That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee. Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it is an important next step in rearmament so that possible threats from China and other adversaries can be averted.
How to debunk a lie A look at the current headlines shows how deception and lies are worrisome and widespread in daily life. Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with allegations of sexual harassment from several women. Both sides are accusing each other of lying. Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys. Last week, French President Nikolas Sarkozy was overheard on an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar. Lies destroy careers and shake countries. New York congressman and Internet exhibtionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence. Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair. And then, of course, no one who lived through it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton caused when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office. Stories of cheating in school and college exams are common. There have been incidents of teachers giving exam answers to their students so that they themselves would do well on their performance reviews. Mentors who should be teaching the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay. How much deception do we experience? As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day. However, many of these lies are considered white lies. Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. Recognising or "detecting" lies is a skill that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons. Far from a parlour game such as charades, where the goal is to shout "Gotcha!," debunking a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology. One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked. Lies look you in the eye. They do not always stutter, stammer, blush or fidget. But from this one must not conclude that these liars are difficult to detect and debunk. A skilled lie detector can get through to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim,the subtle facial expressions, questioning and timing. I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing field of debunking. And it is clear that debunking a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us in navigating our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing is one's professional responsibility. Good liars are very good at sizing up other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others. Thanks to research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell "self-oriented" lies more often than women, whose lies are more "other-oriented" - usually to protect others' feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies"). We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty about having lied to that person. How do you know if someone is lying? First, by observing that person's normal behaviour. This is called baselining, the initial position. It provides a reference point for assessing changes later. Observe the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject. They should know better when someone is usually tripping with their foot all the time, so that they don't blame them unfairly if they are tripping with their foot during a meeting. Then watch for clusters of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Think of these accumulations as alarm bells going off, not as evidence of exposure. People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, shifting their position in a significant way or displaying a 'post-interview relaxation', that deep, relaxing exhale and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over. Questioners often falsely signal that a hiring interview is over, only to look for that post-interview relaxation. Also, pay attention to your subject's language. Scott Peterson's gaffe is famous when he used the past tense when claiming his slain wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her. Deceptive people can also use distancing language, " I did not have sexual relations with that woman.... Miss Lewinsky" or when repeating a tricky question in its entirety. The most common verbal signs are subtle. Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: " Well.... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am aware ... To the best of my knowledge and belief." This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual, which often sets alarm bells ringing. There is no magic cure for debunking lies, but one can learn skills thanks to which debunking is possible. Thanks to these skills, everyone is less likely to fall prey to deceivers, both in their personal and professional lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan gets overhaul after threat of delayed US permit Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering unions while reassuring environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is scrambling to redesign the project so it can get back to normal. TransCanada said Monday night that it will reroute the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska. The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Statehouse. TransCanada's Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different route. This came after a State Department announcement last week that it would postpone a decision on federal approval for the project until it reviewed the new possible route, which avoids the Sandhills area of Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a major underwater supply. "This is a real step forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News. The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision. Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department responsibility and pledged his support. The 1700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas. To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states. Environmentalists hate it, but labour markets love it, estimating that the pipeline would create 20,000 jobs. But Nebraska lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation. The State Department's recent environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says the department's principal investigator has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two questions. One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, has a conflict of interest. The other is whether a company hired to conduct the original study was an improper choice because of its ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle indicted for allegedly forcing toddler to vomit out of fear A New York family alleges that disco diva Patti LaBelle threw a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan building that so terrified their young daughter that she vomited out of fear. The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade so frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in Supreme Court in Manhattan. It was on 10 November last year that stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to leave for a family outing. While Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in their building on Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve in her arms. Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and set her daughter down for a moment. "Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to pick her up again," she said. LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman. "She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't drop your daughter off near the door," Roseanna Monk said. "I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."" She got angry and started ranting - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud.... She had a bottle of water in her hand and started dumping water from the bottle on me. She said Genevieve became hysterical. "I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," the child's mother said. LaBelle lunged at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be restrained by her escort and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said. The baby was crying so hard she threw up, she said. The family later wrote to LaBelle asking for an apology, but received no response. LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not return calls seeking comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he was not charging a fee and the family planned to donate the money it received to Children's Cancer Services. "We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behaviour," Davis said. "This kind of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it's displayed towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
