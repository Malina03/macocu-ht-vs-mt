Europe's most beautiful pools Jump into the blue By Julia Stanek Paddling pools with a UFO look, magnificent pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue wonder - and rest your tired legs in bubble baths after a city tour or a hike. A book shows where wellness in water is at its best. When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing could not be missing from her luggage: her swimming costume. Lying backwards on the water, she gazed up into artfully designed domes, she swam towards marble putties waiting for her at the edge of the pool and marvelled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls. If she liked a pool, she quickly wrote it down in her notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building. Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus. Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast. She doesn't do much sport, says Meder - only in the water it's different. The only annoyance is that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park. "One day I asked myself why swimming pools always had to be so ugly," says Meder, who lives in Vienna. "So I started collecting beautiful pools." Water surface doubled Architecture splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder. And if the builders have put some effort into it, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths." "On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building." Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colourful tiles, diving boards. On 190 pages, the small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" (Bathing Pleasures) provides interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue. Meder, a pool collector, discovered remarkable examples during her research in Hungary. In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing body of water in a rustic karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). Spectacular views, on the other hand, are offered by many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you can see the whole city from Zurich's rooftop pool, you can look down on the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can watch the goings-on on the ski slopes. Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps. It steams in winter from three open-topped bowls, while the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky in the background. Alhambra in the Black Forest Not in every swimming pool did the smell of chlorine reach Meder's nose. Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, and in the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it stinks so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath. The smell comes from the alkaline-hydrogen-carbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind. However, Iris Meder was also disappointed at one place in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the open-air and sunbathing pool in the Czech spa of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off area. The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed. When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles. The decay, on the other hand, has been counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad. This bath has already been through three construction phases; you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style that was added around 1900. Since its careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she is originally from the Black Forest. "It's quite an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder. With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a secondary matter.
Agricultural speculation Deutsche Bank has its commodity business investigated By Christian Teevs Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business with agricultural commodities? According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor. In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences. Hamburg - For the German citizens, the matter is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize. Two thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest people. This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch. The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October. In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and that the banks are therefore partly to blame for the global hunger problem. The campaign of the consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way. Originally, commodity bets were meant to hedge traders against price fluctuations. But most experts now agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest. Unlike his US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to look into the accusations and said that no deal was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk." According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report. The examination is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with them. At the end of January, the bank's top management will then announce what consequences it will draw. The end result could be a reduction of the commodities business or even a complete withdrawal. Ackermann is tinkering with his image Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are damaging the common good today." Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, now has a special duty, he said. "Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said. "It doesn't matter whether Mr Ackermann is concerned about people suffering from hunger or about Deutsche Bank's reputation." Ackermann's admission comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the group boss wants to present a perfect image just a few months before he leaves office. On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, contrary to plans, the CEO will not move to the supervisory board. By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image. And he need hardly worry about possible losses - after all, his successor would have to deal with that. One in two would quit commodity investments Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high. So far, more than 30,000 internet users have taken part in the organisation's campaign. On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November. According to the survey, just eleven per cent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that involve betting on food prices. Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such business: According to the survey, one in two would cancel all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation. 43 percent would advise acquaintances not to use such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna The relocated pavilion By Ingeborg Wiensowski An architectural story with ups, downs and a happy ending: the Austrian World's Fair pavilion from Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and fell into disrepair. Now it is being reopened as an exhibition building. When people rave about modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold sweeps and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion designed by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is an apt and famous example. Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction. The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture. It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World's Fair. He finally became internationally famous in 1973 with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich. His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's Südbahnhof after the World's Fair, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened in it - it was called the "20s Haus." However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art on, no good climate. Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new home. Since 2001, the building has stood empty and deteriorated more and more. Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future. On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the building belongs, will open its first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect. Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in 2007, pushed through the new beginning. Husslein-Arco, who holds a doctorate in art history and had a remarkable career as a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, pushed for the renovation with politicians and preservationists, she raised public funds and private sponsorships and determined the use of the building. Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba from the foundation of the same name were to be exhibited, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built to go with it. Strict supervision, small budget Krischanitz was the ideal person to carry out the project. Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and extended Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he had studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was a "tremendously important place" for him, where he had gone to see the exhibitions "almost every weekend." He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and converted. There were far greater problems with the current conversion: The building was "an energy guzzler," says Krischanitz. The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, fibreglass-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass. Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated. Two basement levels brought space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides lighting, and a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion. The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown rust-proof colour. And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be. And all of this was done under the strict supervision of the heritage authorities and on a small budget. "We often had to find a material that was good and cheap and that also pleased the heritage office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement. Despite all the constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light. It was difficult with the pavilion "that came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "drop-in-the-city story." Architecture like this is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness." In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because a stroke of urban planning luck has occurred: The completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" is currently being built around the Schweizer Garten, with office and residential buildings. And another stroke of luck may yet occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle, and rumour has it that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package worth millions Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in winter. The number of employees is to be doubled. This will cost millions. According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year to combat winter-related train cancellations and delays. The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, referring to an internal crisis plan, that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015. The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions. Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000. The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by the start of operations and 90 per cent of the points required for operations within four to five hours. Two months ago, after a top-level meeting with government and industry, railway boss Rüdiger Grube warned of train cancellations and delays also this winter. Last winter, the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport because, among other things, they lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions. For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years. In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains. For years, the railway has also had to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had a broken axle in Cologne's main station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the USA After the turmoil surrounding the boss Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in fines there. As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the USA is now catching up with the industry giant: The Frankfurt-based institution is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a settlement to resolve disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis. At issue is the sale of mortgage securities. The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks into buying the financial products with false promises; they had downplayed the risks. Such securities lost a lot of their value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down with them. "We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York. The bank did not admit guilt with the settlement. So did Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million. NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the concession by the two financial institutions. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and steps in during bankruptcies to protect customer deposits. The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billions of dollars in damages incurred. The settlements now reached are the first of their kind. The regulator had also taken on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer. The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities. They are based on home loans. When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was the undoing of a large number of financial firms. In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed. Even though the events took place several years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the USA. Investors and regulators have brought countless lawsuits to seek redress or punish misconduct. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the largest wave of lawsuits. It accuses 18 major international banks of cheating the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions worth around 200 billion dollars. Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA over several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007. The supervisory authority is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank pay for "substantial losses," without, however, naming an exact sum. Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as baseless and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM. Since March, he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars. Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he did not invest in IT and computer companies because it was difficult to forecast their long-term development. Now, however, he had read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry. He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offered services and procured computer systems for the IT departments of other companies. An investment by Warren Buffett is considered an accolade in the financial world. Accordingly, the IT veteran IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM." Buffett revealed on the US business channel CNBC that he had bought 10.7 billion dollars worth of IBM shares since March. His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 per cent stake. Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the investment until now. He praised the management, which had ensured decent profits even during the economic crisis. "They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy. IBM has been betting on its lucrative IT services, such as running data centres, for some time. The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting, as well as powerful corporate computers. Buffett had tended to avoid technology companies until now. He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands. Instead, Buffett has invested in a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineering company. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns around 80 of its own subsidiaries as well as shares in a whole series of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re. The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it up into one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments. Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest. He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world. His almost unerring sense for making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha." After Buffett's investment became known, IBM shares rose by one per cent in pre-market trading. "Big Blue," as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market and is thus one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, together with Apple and Microsoft. Buffett said, however, that he did not want to buy into Microsoft. Founder Bill Gates, he said, was a close friend.
The threat is tangible After the uncovering of the "Zwickau cell," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law. One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurgent. The murders of eight people of Turkish origin and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. This news is met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany. For many German-Turks, this is the return of a ghost long believed to be dead: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks. Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been in question. However, the right-wing extremist network that has been uncovered reveals dimensions that are still far from being foreseeable. "Is the bloody ideology reviving?" was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk." The newspaper "Sabah," on the other hand, emphasises that one of the perpetrators is said to have been an undercover agent of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and expresses concern that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing extremist quagmire. The Turkish community in Germany reacted calmly: at the weekend, they remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate. Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony. The togetherness was presented in cheerful colours - as a story of success. The reporting of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X," which reports on the background of the murder series. Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" does not miss the opportunity to make this mental connection. "It's starting to stink" is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column. In it, he emphasises that people were murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work. German-Turkish internet forums are extremely critical of the police's actions and their subsequent success in the manhunt. The authors wonder why the German authorities had not thought of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier. Some are prepared to take drastic measures, at least rhetorically: "If things continue to get sloppy here, the migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves." "That will probably be the best self-protection." "On the goodness of the clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen." What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger was made clear by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. The photo of the ruins of the Solingen fire is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory. For no other event showed Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence. The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of unity on the Turkish side. In the Turkish press, the main criticism at the time was the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral service in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid. It was as if the value of a person was calculated according to the amount of tax they paid. The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has become since then. In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive clarification and re-evaluation of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandalous bank from Lake Zurich The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland. UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since. Now a German is supposed to fix it. This is certainly not what Axel Weber had in mind. After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move. Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and dropping friendly remarks about his future colleagues. "UBS has achieved the turnaround." "I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel." But already in September it became clear that everything would turn out quite differently. A UBS trader in London had circumvented all the bank's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros. UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker who was not only famous in Switzerland, had to go. Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is also considered to be in trouble - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come? It has already become known that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012. And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday. This will be tough for Axel Weber. He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a period of familiarisation. In one fell swoop, he will take over responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank." For on the one hand UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years. Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank. It all began in the financial crisis. Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. It had combined the image of the discreet and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a big player in investment banking. In 2007, UBS managed 1.6 trillion dollars of wealthy clients' money, more than any other bank in the world. And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced to the league of the world's largest banks. That made an impression. Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time banking professor in Zurich, recounts: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank back then." "From today's perspective, you ask yourself: How could I have been so wrong?" He was very wrong. In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was seriously wrong at UBS. In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who until then had been considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, surprisingly resigned. A few months later, people suspected why he had left. The bank's investment division had gambled itself away with subprime papers and had to write off billions. To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of no less than 13 billion francs. It actually found investors for this, although some would have turned up their noses at them until shortly before: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive that one did not even learn its name. But that was only the first blow. In April 2008 it got worse. The bank had to announce new losses in the billions, Chairman of the Board Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second best paid board member in Switzerland, resigned. In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS was on the verge of collapse in view of its bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state. The National Bank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a forced convertible bond through which it could become co-owner of the bank. The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it realised how dramatic it is for a small country to house such large banks. After all, UBS's total assets in 2007 were more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic output (see chart). "We could not save UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger. The first disaster was followed by the second. Only a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had possibly evaded taxes with the bank's help. In addition, it agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty. With this, UBS more or less openly admitted to having helped with tax evasion. At the same time, it lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy. After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same. The resignation of the chairman of the board and the board of directors followed. And the exodus of client money. Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to the bad speculations and in asset management due to the assistance in tax evasion. And just when things were getting a bit calmer again, just when one thought that UBS would now get it together again, there follows this unfortunate trader story: a single trader gambles away 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong. And it becomes obvious that risk management in investment banking is still not working. "With the Adoboli case, one has had to realise that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich. The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "UBS's problem is that it doesn't have a grip on risk control." Yet it was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become the guardians of the world's great fortunes: not too many risks, but security for the money - even if the world were to collapse on the other side of the Alpine republic. The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate. The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger. Even the location is classic. The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main railway station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains. The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe. Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here among traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli. Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse palace to elite private banks like Julius Baer. You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy revolving door. Inside, the walls are covered in marble, thick leather armchairs stand in front of it, and next to the bank logo is a large sign indicating "Safe." UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security. However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have suppressed this idea of the Swiss bank at some point - or betrayed it, as the head of a small Swiss private bank thinks. He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks. UBS has become much too big, he thinks - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread out. The Swiss no longer have anything to say there. "And if they do, they have long since adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons." In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank. On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe became visible. "On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash." Politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or about 45 billion euros, to save the major bank on the brink of bankruptcy. How could this happen? If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS. In June 1998, two of the three big Swiss banks merged to form a huge group. The result was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland when it merged - and kept growing. It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised one. Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers came into a lot of money cheaply, with which they could turn a huge wheel. Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors. "I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger. "Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest one who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut person who worked his way up from a banking apprenticeship to the very top." But Ospel had relied on Wuffli in the end. And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger. "This is a tragic case." Tragic, perhaps. What is clear is that cockiness came before a fall. Employees of UBS clearly remember the management meetings at which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: knock Goldman Sachs off its throne. The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth. It led the "League Tables," the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time. That's where UBS wanted to go, to the very top. It had already succeeded in taking a few steps. In the foreign exchange business and in share trading, it played at the top. However, management consultants who were commissioned pointed out a weakness: In the international interest business, "fixed income" in banking parlance, there was a huge gap to the biggest banks. UBS had gaps in American mortgage products. To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence. Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund set up before it invested in American subprime assets. It developed into a massive machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself. Even when other banks had long since sought an exit. "Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS was still buying there," says banking expert Geiger. So great was the euphoria, so deep the fall. One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up the mess turned out to be more difficult than expected. Positions at UBS became a hot seat and are still shaky today. Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job. He has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models. Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. The bank does not want to go quite that far (yet). But investment banking is to shrink considerably, that much is already clear. Next Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world. The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only meant as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with predecessor Grübel. In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he is to lead the business of UBS permanently, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday. Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level of the mid-nineties. He is cutting 3500 jobs. But that will not be enough. UBS needs a vision. Who is it? How does it want to earn money? These are the questions Axel Weber is surely already asking himself. So far he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for a flat in Zurich. Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market The threat of recession in Europe has taken away the courage of US investors at the start of the week. The changes of government in Athens and Rome failed to pack a punch. The dampened industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the bud. The general relief at the changes of government in Rome and Athens failed to take hold. The euro fell against the dollar. Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott. Financial stocks in particular were on the sell list. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 per cent at 12,078 points. In the course of trading, the market barometer hovered between 12,027 and 12,170 points. The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one per cent. The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 per cent and closed at 2657 points. In Frankfurt, the Dax closed down 1.2 per cent at 5985 points. Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the upswing. Companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistics office Eurostat. This made US investors sceptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management. Europe will not be able to extricate itself from a recession any time soon, he said, adding that there are further signs of weakness in the banks. Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview. Therefore, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks. Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle overboard and got into the US technology sector. His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional company and initially sent it almost one percent higher against the trend in trading. The stock closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars. According to Buffett, he paid an average of 170 dollars per share and now holds 5.5 per cent. The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent. Bank of America shares fell 2.6 per cent, significantly more than the market. The bank is selling off almost all of its remaining shares in China Construction Bank for $6.6 billion. The bank wants to use the net profit from the deal primarily to bolster its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements. Aircraft maker Boeing rose, limiting losses in the Dow. The stock gained 1.5 per cent after the group collected the biggest order in its history. Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, putting the value of the order at $18 billion. Including options on 20 more aircraft, the order is worth as much as 26 billion dollars. Some 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 719 stocks rose, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged. On the Nasdaq, 630 shares closed up, 1913 down and 82 unchanged on a volume of 1.38 billion shares.
Intelligent crows are spreading in cities In many places, rooks are considered "problem birds": But experts claim that the highly intelligent animals have not been driven out of cities for a long time. Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: Crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many communities residents complain about the animals' filth and noise. So far, there is no remedy for the "problem birds" in sight. It is impossible to get rooks out of cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frisia. Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions. Conservationists attributed the problems in cities to the migration of the specially protected rooks to the countryside: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional habitats. Hunting, increasing building development and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds. Crows are a protected species. Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found in Soest in Westphalia, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen in the northwest, and in Leer. In 2005, a controversial project to kill crows en masse in the district made negative headlines. Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and beating them to death with clubs as particularly brutal. "The normal expulsion, the scaring away, doesn't achieve anything," has stated urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer. Spraying away nests with water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg as well. "The animals move away, large colonies split up and disperse to other places." Spooking is only conceivable as an exception at hospitals, old people's homes or schools, he said. "We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them." Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer. A combination of banishing the animals from sensitive residential areas and attracting them back to other places is conceivable. "Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated a completely different way of dealing with animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple on our face with self-confidence. Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg Crow Nature Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where information signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent rooks. The project has already been accepted by tourists. Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the birds' noise: "There's a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other." The animals' intelligence and dexterity are legendary: rooks not only use tools to get a tasty morsel, but even make their own tools as an aid. Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested how far the birds' intelligence extends on four rooks. In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larva. Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone had to be in order to collapse the platform. In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a trickier problem. The researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder. The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks. However, the researchers had placed pieces of wire in front of them. All four birds used them to form a hook, which they then used to fish the bucket out of the tube by the handle. Three of the four rooks even succeeded on the first try.
Cristiano Ronaldo sends Portugal to Euro 2012 The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed to materialise. The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are in the Euro 2012. Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs. Led by the double-winning superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and, after the 0:0 from the first leg, made their fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect. The Czechs managed a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off second leg against outsiders Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear affair. Croatia also left no stone unturned in a 0-0 draw with Turkey, while Ireland earned an easy 1:1 (1:0) win over Estonia. Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal. Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had scored twice for Bosnia. Sena Lulic was shown the yellow card (54th). Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Portugal got off to a flying start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon. Ronaldo fired home a free-kick from around 30 metres for an early lead. A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range qualities and scored from 25 metres to make it 2-0. The Bosnians, who did not take part in the first half-hour, had their first clear-cut chance through goalscorer Edin Dzeko. The ex-Wolfsburg player from English league leaders Manchester City put a header on the lower edge of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd). Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic Referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding then took centre stage. After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on a swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.). On the other side, Stark gave a controversial hand penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic converted safely. But after the break, the 2004 European runners-up made everything clear with four goals. Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute. This means that the 1976 European champions will be travelling to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row. The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the opening phase. Petr Cech saved a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok with a reflex save at the last moment (9th). Montenegro had their best chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action. Damjanovic shot just wide of Cech's goal from a turn from the edge of the box in the 40th minute. After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had pulled the trigger (50th). The goal shortly before the end made everything clear. Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb. Four days after the 3-0 defeat in Istanbul, the Turks could not get beyond a 0-0 draw in Zagreb. While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly have to give up his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup bronze medallists, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship finals. In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start. Selcuk Inan hit the post with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, and attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to put the rebound into the net. After the moment of shock, Croatia took more and more control. Even after the break, the Croatians did not let anything go to waste. In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who replaced Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) also played. Trapattoni goes to the European Championship In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany. Stephen Ward gave coach Giovanni Trapattoni's side, who had already clinched the first leg 4-0, the lead in the 32nd minute. Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalised for the visitors. Ireland pressed from the start but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance. It was only at the last moment that the Estonian backline prevented a possible opening goal. In the 32nd minute, however, the time had come. Ward was on hand to push the ball over the line for the 1:0 lead after a bad clearance by goalkeeper Pavel Londak.
