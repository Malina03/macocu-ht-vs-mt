US artist's son implicated in 'museum theft' The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum. According to the Pennsylvania Police Department, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer. Word is that Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains. 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan. As the Associated Press news agency reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident. AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud. The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by any means necessary to put all the paintings in storage." The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied granting any permission.
Labor defends budget and tax hikes Ministers have defended the tax hikes and spending freezes announced in the pre-budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and unions. The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers. Among its key proposals are a 0.5 percent increase in Social Security and a 1 percent cap on public wage agreements for 2011. Social Security Anger Unions have protested that low-wage workers are being penalized for a recession they didn't create, warning of an impending " problems." The increase in social security - to around £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on economic recovery. The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers. PRE-BUDGET REPORT HIGHLIGHTS Social Security increased by another 0.5% from April 2011 Economy contracted more than expected 4.75% this year New 50% tax on banker bonuses 1 percent increase in corporate income tax for small businesses scrapped tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines State pensions increased by 2.5% The Treasury estimates that someone on £30,000 a year will be £90 poorer a year and someone on £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while someone with £10,000 annual income will be £110 richer. Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 would mean "difficult choices," but they also said that 60% of the burden of the surcharge would fall on the top 5% earners. Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending freezes would be "a drop in the bucket" compared to the necessary measures. "These are big numbers. They will bring us the halving of the deficit and this is imperative over the next four years as well," he told the BBC. Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year. Labour's forecasts of future economic growth - affecting the level of borrowing and the speed of deficit reduction - have been called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures. He said in his statement the economy is likely to contract by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% contraction predicted in April - while debt would be £3bn higher than before estimated. 'Missed opportunity' The Conservatives, who are set to launch a new campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's 'debt crisis', said the proposed £789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable. They added that ministers have failed to come up with a credible plan for how they will repay this and are "cynically" shirking difficult decisions until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 at the latest. "They haven't said anything of substance about what they're going to do," said Shadow Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let it pass." "The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins it." Roger Bootle, Deloitte Labor insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals who see deficit cuts coming faster and sooner. But the Liberal Democrats said the money gained from the tax hikes and spending freezes will be used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand " be. BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said that some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment to some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor to vote-snapping charges as the money could easily be clawed back next year. Labor insists it will provide the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be reassessed in September 2010. 'Hot budget' Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only materialize in the medium term. The respected institute for tax investigations said the Chancellor of the Exchequer's numbers mean sharp cuts in many areas, possibly including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future. "It just puts the pain off for later," said its director, Robert Chote. "The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at accounting firm Deloitte. "This was just the hollow pre-budget report. Markets are realizing that."
FBI investigates "arrests of US citizens in Pakistan" The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan. The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC. The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who went missing in the state of Virginia last month. The US State Department said they are also looking for information about the men. Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other is of Yemeni background. "Of course, if you are an American citizen, we are very interested in the charges against you and the circumstances under which you are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly. FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students. "We are working with the Pakistani authorities to establish their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are indeed the missing students," she said. The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house owned by the uncle of one of the students. He said local police had previously taken an interest in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men. Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the US must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people." The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still just as bad as they have been in the past 20 years. The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime both before and after the contested presidential election in June. A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape. Iran has dismissed previous criticism of its human rights record. Officials said such criticism was politically motivated. Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, sparking the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death. BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that when the protests began, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the Kahrizak detention center to be closed. But since then there has been zero tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said. 'False confession' Amnesty International quoted the account of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with 'working with Facebook networks' and protesting the election results. "They often slapped me in the face," he was quoted as saying. "I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on the back of my neck, on my head... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me." After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious, Amnesty International said. Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped. Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted abuses did take place. Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been held with 75 others in a container at a detention center in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks. Amnesty recognized that Iran's parliament and judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and government responses to it, but said Amnesty said the mandates and powers of these bodies were unclear and the findings made by the parliamentary committees had been won were not published. The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks in a bid to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope created in City Park More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform a Bristol landmark into a competition slope. This park event's ski slope attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes. At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park there was a short ski jump at the start of a 100 meter long slope. Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also pretty intimidating. It's a great view with all the city lights twinkling below. He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent." Prizes were awarded for the best feat - or trick - performed on the slope. After Thursday night's event, the snow will be left to melt.
Still They and Us Can Islam be French? Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban minaret construction and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and considered account of whether Muslims are entering one of the most avowedly secularized countries in the world Societies of Europe can be integrated - and will be integrated. Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, Why the French Don't Like Headscarves (2006), an elegant and thickly argued study of a controversial issue , which divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half and whose effects can still be felt today. Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum. As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field. He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer what Bowen calls "Islamic freedom" for France's 5 to 6 million Muslims. He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that bother them the most. Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)? Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights? Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man? Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest rate banking system to get a mortgage? It's these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, that make up everyday life, as opposed to the political dramas that preoccupy the media. The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, with the possible exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic. This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society. They don't have all the arguments on their side. Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam. The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts - advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia - who show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims today. Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible. But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides. He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite who so ardently guard the separation of church and state) are genuinely committed to pluralism. He suggests that Muslims may receive harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism. He recognizes a "tightening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism. Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate view The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth. The ice that marks them is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else. Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries interests have entered the newly opened waters with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake. In On Thin Ice, author and illustrator Richard Ellis draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear. Well versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in the hunt for polar bears. Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old midshipman fighting with nothing but the butt of his musket is certainly one legend, but others are true. Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers have been taken to zoos and circuses. A circus performance in the early 20th century featured 75 polar bears performing. Even today, zoo facilities still typically have one-millionth the living area of a wild adult. The climate is seldom suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has turned green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its pelt. Click here to learn more! Drawing on the accounts of other authors and historians, Ellis often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species. Though banned in Norway, America and Russia, the hunt continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile-riding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring down their prey. Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest. In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist magazine, offers a clear and disturbing account of Arctic science and a gripping glimpse of how the future is unfolding could. Not that scientists have all the answers. Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change. But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts. Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave an idea of the turbulence of the pack ice for the first time. During the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges when underway. A useful addition is satellite surveys and the widespread deployment of probes on icebergs, but much is still being accomplished by intrepid people camping out in the cold. Anderson looks into the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the arctic ice, formed by rivulets of saltwater that are compressed as they freeze. But from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are at risk when the summer ice melts away, which is expected to happen between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months...that could be us" Marines were among 6,000 to lay wreaths in Arlington Corporal De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he never served had met. For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed. In a few months, wherever we're brought back from, that could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers. If that were us, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect that way. He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves in several sections of Arlington Cemetery. Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery. It's now an 18-year tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip each year, stop in various towns along the way to host events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism. The Worcesters also started a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states. This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths at graves in Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York and the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pa. The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and ship the wreaths for the second time. Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a career soldier who died. Although her husband's funeral isn't in Arlington, Hunt said it's her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices. She said it's a small way we civilians can support our soldiers. It's like visiting a family gravesite. Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the cemetery's sprawling lawns and hills. The volunteers were targeting older graves from World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, organizers say. The mood was cheerful, with children playing and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine boughs to the graying tombstones. Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the top. Section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent. The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the somber mood of the current wars filled this area. Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the frigid air. Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white place cards that had been placed in the damp mud for those whose tombstones were not yet finished. Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears at her son's grave. She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the gravesite of Marine Corporal David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July. No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said. "If it's been a long time since I've been gone, I want someone to remember him."
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who was selling cellphones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday. The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda. The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and for the World Bank. US Interests Section consular officers in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5. The specific charges have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on charges of "endangerment." All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest. Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime. Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being followed and attacked by government officials. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to collect awards, but has always been denied. The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has sought "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island. News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night. The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate. Cell phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average wage for a government employee is $15 a month. The Cuban government only allowed ordinary citizens to buy cell phones this year, and they're used primarily for texting, since a 15-minute call would cost a day's wages. Internet use is extremely limited on the island. It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government offices such as universities. Cubans who wish to log in are often required to report their names to the government. Access to many websites is restricted. Arresting an American is rare in Cuba. Most of the few US citizens jailed in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, press secretary for the US Interests Section in Havana. Berbena said she could not provide any further information about the arrest. The arrest and detention are clearly false. An activity that would be legal in any other free society -- giving away free cell phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the US section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedom in Cuba Cuba, entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba," a nod to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing ailing older brother Fidel. Vivanco said that very often the accused are arrested, tried and imprisoned within a day. He said that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries are moving toward more dialogue.
Pakistani officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged mastermind of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers and said they hope this case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters scouring the internet for radicalized young men. Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after tracking them down because one of them had made comments supporting terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube. Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said Saturday Saifullah failed to convince al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network. As a result, they have been held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable northwest mountains that have become a terrorist haven. They were seen as part of a covert operation. That's why they were denied, said the government official, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter. The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued trying to get the right referrals to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies. The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role recruiters play in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who can be trusted. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of the highest urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda. The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, not letting in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies. American would-be recruits are subjected to special scrutiny by A Qaeda, analysts said. However, they are also considered immensely attractive to the group because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value. Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access in recent years, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods. When trying to insinuate someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruiting model that so many have followed? Kohlmann said. The model is now much more internet based.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate "action" in Copenhagen Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday demanding bolder action on climate change from negotiators at the city's Bella convention center. Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were closer to around 25,000. The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some downtown government buildings. On a day when little was happening at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners that read "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish that declared "The Earth Says Enough" A few stars joined the protest, including Danish model photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother's country of birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already felt effects of the "It's part of the reason I decided to take part in the big demonstration -- to pass the word and appeal to world leaders to hammer out a fair, ambitious and binding deal," she said not an easy task but it must be done now and there is no getting around it The police held the protesters there from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives. According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations. According to a bystander who asked not to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters dressed in black detonated several explosive devices near Copenhagen's main canal, where several ministries are located. They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares but were then followed by "a couple of big explosions." Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon. But the protest has apparently failed to reach the minds of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator. When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international deliberations, he replied in English: "It's something I wasn't even aware of." He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside." He noted that whether the demonstration would do harm or help would depend on an individual's perspective. It shows the focus of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said. On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with negotiations or other people's freedom."
Exam data reveals persistent racial divide Math achievement reports were welcome good news for Washington DC public schools last week Although the District of Washington still lags far behind the nation's top-performing schools, reports show that fourth and eighth graders in have made faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York in the past two years. But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally. The average score of white fourth-graders in Washington, DC, increased from 262 to 270 (out of a 500 scale) over the past two years, but that of their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212. The performance gap actually widened between 2007 and 2007 2009 from 53 to 58 points. The progression of the eighth-grader African-American students was basically the same, falling a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244. The average score for white students was not included in the assessment data because the sample size was not large enough. The picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging either. The gap separating white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the district's first NAEP was recorded, was 60 points (262 to 202). And although the number of points achieved by children in both groups has increased over this period, the difference has hardly narrowed, now at 58 points. Some district education advocates last week expressed concern that the results, celebrated by School Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were driven in large part by white students, who are already high-achieving kids. "This suggests that we raised the overall score by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult," said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for educational equality in Washington D.C. I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School. Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message from the exam scores is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention. Of course you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that. But what scares me is that we don't devote nearly the time and energy that we would have to devote to our middle school. Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the underperforming students. This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who did not master basic reading skills early in their school careers and who are significantly behind their peers in their class. Everyday Math, a curriculum that emphasizes games and real-life experiences from kindergarten through sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former chief school superintendent Clifford Janey, and that curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP advances reported last week . "I think we need to keep working to ensure that the best policies benefit those students who are under-grading," Rhee said. Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the system's overall performance while continuing to provide the additional money and resources needed to close the gap for underperforming schools to decrease. This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies city exam scores. The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and managerial reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C. are located. Targeting could create political repercussions that work against this important agenda item. The weak point, of course, as with other city school inspectors, is that it seeks to retain the white and black middle classes. Our focus is to make sure we build a great school system. We must strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be assured that their children can receive a quality public school education. Janey, who is now the school superintendent in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements in closing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to include charter schools to compete. You have to increase the school year to anywhere near 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year for 185 days a year, which he describes as "a milestone" on the way to a bigger one Increase considered in next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle. Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawn. Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador. Until recently, Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus either. Her attitude, and that of the other eighth-graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was that of an awed visitor rather than an enthusiastic prospective student. "Yes! I'll be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the science building. "Wow really?" she said thoughtfully when told about the school's low professor-to-student ratio. College in Pennsylvania was the 7th the kids visited on their three-day tour, and now they've fully absorbed the intended message: The question isn't whether you go to college. The question is where. While there is growing concern about the large number of US-born children of Hispanic immigrants who fail to finish high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college education needed to climb into the middle class . In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college -- a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school. Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce. Those who study high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to succeed. Many of them also have parents who aim high for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools. But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get through to college, especially if these efforts are sustained over time. When looking at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, a single action at any given time won't solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic students. We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool through high school. The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example. Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school completed. According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone on to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs deals with 10 foreign oil companies Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions completed on Saturday. The Iraqi Oil Ministry's 10 deals signed with foreign oil companies suggest China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in renovating Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades. American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves. Seven American companies paid to take part in the second auction, which began on Friday. The only company that submitted a bid lost out. Two American companies were able to secure contracts for fields auctioned in June. The few representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts. Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service. There won't be any more offers in Iraq for a long time. Security concerns, underscored by Tuesday's massive coordinated bombing campaign, and political instability from the US military withdrawal have likely kept American oil companies from investing more in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude oil reserves, analysts said. US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks by not being accountable to shareholders. Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to sign contracts with the department. Bigger US companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice over the past few years, got nothing. Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and went home with large packages of contracts for two major fields. We all know, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world economic giants as well as a tech powerhouse. We are confident that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and fulfill its commitments to Iraq. Companies preselected to bid submitted bids, which were then compared to the per-barrel oil fee the Department was willing to pay to increase each field's output above current levels.
Top Al Qaeda Planner Apparently Killed in Pakistan A top Al Qaeda planner was reportedly killed this week in an apparent US missile attack along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan this week, US counterterrorism officials reported Friday. If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a senior official at the terrorist organization this fall. Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed by a number of rockets that struck their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday, according to US sources and Pakistani regional officials. Local authorities said the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt. They were driving towards the Afghan border in a white vehicle when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official from Miran Shah said by phone. Local residents suspected of being among the militants rushed to the spot and quickly took what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies." Local authorities could not confirm the identities of the victims, but two US counter-terrorism officials cited indeterminate evidence that Somali were among the dead. Somali has been described as a senior al Qaeda military planner, directing operations by terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who asked to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil. Given its central role, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe. He took strategic directions from top Al Qaeda leaders and translated them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks. The second American official said Somali had risen quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had close ties with other extremist groups in the region. He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but that in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies. If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists. The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined from an average of six operations a month to two a month since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization. The drop may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informers, the site reported.
Top UN envoy in Kabul to resign The top UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from his post in March, ending a stormy tenure marked by allegations of widespread corruption at the government's headquarters UN-backed Afghan presidential election was marred. Ede's departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan. The UN envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces. We must speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces, thereby sending the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. The commitment must be long-term. The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers tasked with helping Afghanistan's political transition. The troop increase on the military side must match an increase on the civilian side, he said. Eide said he is not stepping down, but is simply fulfilling an agreement he made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for just two years. He said he would forward the notification to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now to give him time to arrange for a replacement. What I said is he better start looking for a successor, Eide said. When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival. Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to UN officials. UN officials say he was considering Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations. Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive voter fraud. Eide has denied all the allegations, but he also said the allegations by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election." Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan. He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, saying it would give them confidence that their money was being used properly . Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of his forces in Afghanistan, saying the cumbersome UN recruitment rules have undermined his ability to bring in capable people. The UN rules are such that since May, he said, I've only been able to hire one person. This is catastrophic and must not continue like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran Faces Additional Sanctions Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for failing to participate in talks on its nuclear plans. Speaking to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran. There aren't good options to choose from in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development. "One of the things that's on my mind, if we've learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, is the inherent unpredictability of war." The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has said some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian. He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that they are in fact less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions. On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran could face "plausible" consequences if it failed to comply with UN Security Council demands with its nuclear program and its nuclear watchdog organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes. At talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear program and give up a significant portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor. The US government has been pushing for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations. But Iran appears to have since walked out of negotiations on the interim accords -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leaders are divided over whether they should commit to the United States. Frankly, Iran's abandonment of the international community on some proposals that they agreed to earlier in October has brought the international community together, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way they did in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said. President Obama has set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to act on these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crushing sanctions." In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations has condemned what it called "baseless and unfounded allegations" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities on Thursday, saying they are ready to open talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution." Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil. Tensions between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority remain high, particularly over borders, property rights and the sharing of public revenues. Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to avoid delays in US plans to reduce American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August. Gates also tried to allay Kurdish concerns about the impending troop withdrawal. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq. We will not abandon you."
Changing course in aging China Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that "Mother Earth is too tired to support any more children" and "One more baby means one more grave." They learned those lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, amid low birth rates and an aging population, suddenly began changing course this summer and encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and finally was: "Absolutely not." We have already invested all our time and energy in one child. There's no room left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son. More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously plump, spoiled only children affectionately dubbed "little emperors," a population crisis is looming in the country. The average fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 when the policy went into effect, the UN Population Department notes, while the number of people aged 60 and over in 2020 has increased from 16.7 percent of the population is expected to explode to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent. The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai. Last year, 60-year-olds and older made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was under one child per couple. Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, has said couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help lower the aging population ratio and alleviate future labor shortages." Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said. A Gradual Relaxation Enshrined in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial injunction introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date. Couples who break this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace. Chinese officials have credited the policy with avoiding critical strain on the country's natural resources, while human rights advocates have condemned abuses in the policy's enforcement. In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had children to have abortions. Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio. In recent years, government officials on population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy. In 2004, they admitted more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were only children -- and in 2007 the tone of many tough slogans was toned down. Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Population Research Institute, said government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children where one partner is an only child. Shanghai in July became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births. Posters admonishing families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval. City officials have sent city officials and family planning volunteers to visit couples' homes and slip leaflets under doors. She also asked that psychological and financial counseling be made available to those who have more than one child. The response hasn't been exactly encouraging, family planning officials said. Disappointing Response Although officials from a rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, urban counties report no change. For example, in Huinan Municipality, which has a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received each month. Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the city's expected number of births in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008. Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want to have more children. They want to give their first the best, she said. Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that it is legal. But like many Chinese, they have minimal government health and life insurance. Without a social safety net, they say, that decision would be irresponsible. Westerners misinterpret the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with their first child. Yes, we are being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child. But the problem is not simply one of politics. The problem is money. Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation. Wang, the human resources director, said she only wants one child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us. We're not used to looking after others and we don't really want to." Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly. For middle-class parents with dual careers that are driving down birth rates, he said, being successful is about being successful and it takes selfishness. Today's 20-39 year old age group grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's capitalism experiment and they don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said. Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on a parent's time. A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years. Then there's the space issue -- "You have to remodel your home" -- and life planning -- "By the time the kid is 9 months old, you've got to have a resume ready for the best preschools." Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice. Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said. We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to cut emissions The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- put a renewed focus on Friday with the release of a document calling for ambitious cuts over the next 40 years of greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations having to shoulder the heaviest burden in the near future. The text, which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward. But it was seen as an important advance in a trial that is running out of time, as more than 100 world leaders are due to arrive in Copenhagen next week. The text, drafted by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the amount of money rich countries should give to poor countries to help them tackle global warming in the short and long term. It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would support. A lot of flexibility is being given to the process, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington. Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has condensed a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the UN's senior climate advocate, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture." It outlines a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period. Together, the countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050. The European community also gave the talks a boost on Friday by pledged to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - by tackling the Floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation. Nevertheless, Friday brought the same verbal fireworks that had dominated the talks for the past week. US climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected language calling for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies if they are not financed by the developed world. This move heralded that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than the Bush administration did just two years ago. The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies stepping up and taking action, according to Stern, who also lamented that the text does not go far enough to ensure the cuts could be corroborated by outsiders. Stern delivered his comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that America's top climate negotiator either lacked "reasonableness" or was "highly irresponsible" in saying earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China tackle global warming. Because the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, fault lines have opened both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies. The current struggle is as much about saving individual economies as it is about saving the planet, with China and the United States at odds over their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific need to to take bolder action. Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in doing so, countries with very high greenhouse gas tax to account for their actions. This is clearly a game from which new economic dominance will emerge, according to Ulate, who also serves as Conservation International's regional climate change advisor in Mexico and Central America. Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding deal in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will result in a political deal at best. The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning. Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate talks for the European Commission, said the small island nation offensive "puts political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and action from emerging economies like China and India, are demanding. The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most outstanding issues still need to be resolved prior to the arrival of government leaders in order to reach an agreement. High-ranking officials such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Vice Minister disembarked from their planes and raced through the aisles of the Bella Center to closed-door meetings and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated over the next week. The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people are in and out of the convention center daily, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows poke fun at the countries they think are betraying and selling out, and draft treaties are hand-to-hand instead passed on by email -- is already a challenge. The intensity is just building: almost all the key ministers are here now, and as of Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen. We're coming to the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International. The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km/h train redefines the Monday feeling At 5.13am Monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that will revolutionize transport in Britain. The first high-speed commuter train in the country will make its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras at 225 km/h, covering 93 km in 38 minutes. Joining Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, will be Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first ever Javelin commuter service from London. He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains, linking the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London. The neglected province could become vibrant commuter towns, commuting times would be radically reduced, and the shift from planes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion. In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision. But the many billions of pounds sterling needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put the brakes on Britain's high-speed rail network. High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will present the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times. This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network. The new railway line, which will link London to the West Midlands, will have a margin of five meters around urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial. In the open field, the plan will show the concept within 25 meters of the final route. HS2 is also expected to create three options for a larger northbound high-speed rail network. Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would enter the West Midlands. The line would split at or near Birmingham and one branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. A single line would lead to Scotland. "It appears to be the best-working option," said a railroad insider. Once complete, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes. The first leg, which would not open until 2025, would allow travelers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today. The designs would allow trains to travel at speeds of 400 km/h, making Britain's rail network the fastest in Europe. The first line was designed to accommodate trains 400 meters long with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people. Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham route. This in turn would mean that a terminus would be needed in London that could handle 20,000 travelers an hour. Given the space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing train station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network. Rail experts say only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential. Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks this plan should go ahead, but the lengthy public deliberation and planning process means a final decision will not be made until after the general election. But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network has to be built in sections. Trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail routes in north Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours. This is seen as a key sticking point to ensure a switch from air to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay to mortgage Conservative's £75,000 orangery Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative MP, has been billing taxpayers thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built on his constituency home. The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons were being "living on meager rations," has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to have an oak-framed extension built to his second home in Rutland . He was allowed to bill the taxpayer for the extra interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month. House of Commons officials approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts an inquiry into MPs' spending. Last night, Duncan said the motions "couldn't have been cleaner or clearer." Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency. Nearby houses have fetched nearly £1m (€1.1m). The ground floor includes the kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a House of Commons spending control agency, has agreed that Duncan needs more space. Last year he added a conservatory, which the plans refer to as the "orangery." Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment." Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent Committee on Standards and Privileges investigation into his previous mortgage contracts. The committee acquitted him of breaking the rules last month after an investigation into his spending. In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a £271,406 (€300,000) mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before he was elected Member of Parliament. Documents released this week show that Duncan was being paid around £1,400 a month in mortgage interest up until March last year. In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 (€2,000) a month. The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting the entire increase was used to fund the £75,000 (€85,000) borrowing. The RBS normal stepless mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still. The latest documents released by the House of Commons show Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 (€1,400) a month this May. Duncan lost his job as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs were living "on meager rations" in the wake of the spending scandal. "Basically, working for the state means living on meager rations and being treated like s*****s." He said: "I've spent my money on my garden and I'm claiming a tiny fraction compared to what is proper. And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I'm not." The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked over his spending in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before checking with the Fees Office that it was "as could be considered an excessive demand." An activist has dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed he had solicited £4,000 (€4,500) over three years. When questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value." He added: "There's no debate about dodging and dodging or bending the rules or anything like that. Everything is perfectly transparent and strictly within the rules, authorized and everything. It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's Beach Hut Advent Calendar Beach huts in Brighton have found a new lease of life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar. Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages with Christmas carols as the theme for each day of December. The event kicked off on December 1st and visitors were allowed to view the newest cabin each day from 5:30pm to 6:30pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit. The Christmas carols chosen so far are "I saw three ships," "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël," with the cabin decoration here being the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist. Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister for the Diocese of Chichester and director of Beyond. He said: "We want to make religion more important again for people in a post-Christian society. As a church, why do we expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and inspire Hosting celebrations. The idea of the beach hut advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner. Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express that through our spirituality."
