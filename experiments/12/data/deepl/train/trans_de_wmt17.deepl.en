28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother testified that he couldn't think of anyone who would want to harm him, "Things were finally looking up for him."
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Department of Forensic Sciences announced.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death has been ruled a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told San Francisco ABS station KGO that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, landed his dream job as a cook at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will sorely miss him," the spokesperson continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was initially living in hostels but that, "things were finally looking up for him."
"He found a flat, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia informed KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not think of anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of bonding with his family was to always cook us something, make us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
'He never wanted to take part in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who went with the flow.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this diamond in the rough that shone bright every day," he said.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's tip line at 415-575-4444.
Residents strike: Calls for new industrial action
Resident deputies have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its full council to authorise more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC testified that ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Residents and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the election.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "doggedly silent" on issues that led to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action beginning in early September.
The disputes have led to junior doctors striking six times this year, the first total walkouts in NHS history.
The head of the BMA Resident Doctors Dr Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during meetings held before the vote by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be compulsory for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St Petersburg's palace, I can't help feeling that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed tight-lipped and he hardly radiated warmth, even by his reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - a full five times, according to one report.
I could no longer count them.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin lashed out and accused Ankara of stabbing Russia in the back.
The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, no-holds-barred attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin got the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that typically bring several million Russian tourists to Turkish shores each year.
The number has dropped by almost 90 %.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They are counting on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists this way, tomatoes this way."
But the visit had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, seeing its response to the attempted takeover as weak.
Add to that lingering resentment over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - eager to capitalise on the chilly mood and diminish Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This, mind you, is par for the course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glittering palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst once described to me as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel outcast and mistreated by the West and are now allying.
Yet, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator on Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for utter disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to just a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
It supported international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus on more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, devolved head office and listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller retail banking brands that will take on more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand our staff will be employed under as we now become more of a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we don't have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of those brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our people will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already said it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" the chief executive said.
'It would have been very cynical three years ago to say we are going to be a great bank for our customers and launch these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time is now.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket gives him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, at his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said, "It's special."
I am very emotional because my family is also here.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humbled.
Dettori takes in the cheers as he takes the win on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the steeplechase milestone - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has excited fans about the sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have already racked up 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big-tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden winners in GB for nearly 30 years already, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for British racing, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British flat racing for two decades.
It's been nerve-wracking.
A string of big-tournament wins, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed impressive strength of character to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori has previously said he wants to continue competing until he is at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transport affairs.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "ordered Ivanov's dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration" without giving reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed to replace him.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website says (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of staff of the government staff.
About his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your activity as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
The move has shrouded Moscow in secrecy.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite smiling for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say onerous post - for four years.
As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
At one time it was thought that Ivanov might become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third Putin term would have violated the constitution.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after punching producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produces the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued a public apology on Thursday before announcing his termination.
'There were artistic differences and a disagreement on set.
I regret the incident,' he said in a statement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and most of all, the best fans a series could ask for.
The scheduled air date for the twelfth season is 28 September.
Mystery of fish landing in Banff garden
A Banff resident called for help identifying the fish that turned up in his Banff garden.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish may be sand eels that were spewed from a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now linked to Fife
The £1.35bn project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the 'deck fans' nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 stay cables.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Business Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the site today and was one of the first from the country to walk onto the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing engineering of a truly epic scale on this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used on this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the final section of the deck is receiving a concrete deck pour in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said, "The first closure represents a significant milestone on any bridge project.
On this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering structural and civil engineering.
After installing the final road deck section and connecting it to the north tower deck, which is currently being upgraded, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or landside.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at a gradient of about 3%.
Tricky because the tolerances the team was working to were tiny - only a few millimetres on each side.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew witnessed the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men were struggling to swim to safety while their boat continued to move under its own power.
"We saw the boat spinning around near them and imagined the worst," Moelfre lifeboat station manager Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds had already blown the boat out of their reach by the time we launched," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a lifejacket.
They all boarded the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
The boat's engine did have an emergency stop line, but it came loose from the person steering the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring instead to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and more active.
Screen time was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I'm referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go craze, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (it later spawned an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped off somewhat before the game's release in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by massive demand, which overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In a nutshell, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked exercising 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who among them is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data on the increase in performance.
Many public health education campaigns to get people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be overstated.
People who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to mention here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people doing something outdoors that they enjoy.
So it covers three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy killjoys who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone might run into a door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity before, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will lose its appeal and use will wane over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles takes gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Dynamic on the vault.
Effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
Brilliant across the board.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast scaled to the all-around title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was clearly ahead of silver medallist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
American Simone Biles gymnasts on the balance beam during the women's individual all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American woman to win an all-around title and the fifth overall as she solidifies her reputation as the best of her generation, or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights, she said:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with routines so amazing, involving a mix of ambition and precision, that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she was "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
A final test awaited her in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but between her and a burden of outsized expectations.
Not returning to family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the women's individual all-around gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point at the farewell party for retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted during her long journey to the top she never planned for the future, that's not really true.
Part of her floor routine - which includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wants it to.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture was deceiving.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles holds the world title - were lurking.
She caught up again with a 15.433 on the balance beam - and added to it with a 15.933 on floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited their final result - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Bile's glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was revenge for the last time she competed four years ago, when she battled for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had an edge.
After her floor exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that at times seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's fast-spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Police reports released Thursday said two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed while talking and listening to music in a car in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple homicide does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others injured in nine attacks in four months, predominantly in Hispanic neighbourhoods.
"It's happening in a residential neighbourhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, an affiliate of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have been using multiple vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalised for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to be sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide and is believed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It gets better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like very few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't get into that.
Which is not true at all -- of course you got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund may never be able to recognise her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalising him.
"My first response to that was 'I didn't know people still did that,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund is able to walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was three years old and he still cannot speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund came up with for "Please sing to me.""
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not typical sign language -- she says. Edmund made up some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic, like Edmund's, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what will happen?
What is going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding prompt rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi overflowed their banks, threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and help was already on its way to affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be in place over much of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in the area.
A flood early warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday, while rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will in all likelihood reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban neighbourhoods near Baton Rouge.
He also said downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger because they will be slow to flow into Lake Maurepas via the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded as early as 09.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, said water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was pouring and pouring in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she had lived there, she had never seen the river reach such a high point.
Hansford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military truck and took them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had become significantly waterlogged due to the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused residents to be rescued from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes to be cancelled in five school districts.
CBS morning news station WWL reported that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa cited 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Parish priest Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house evacuees.
"Once the water starts receding, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the Hammond town of Tangipahoa Parish, nearly two dozen roads have been closed due to the flooding and sandbags have been made available for residents to take with them as they hope to keep the water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This looks to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, 'riddled with bullets', survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy's condition was listed as critical at a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Also shot were three men: two aged 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are currently investigating whether the perpetrator could be among one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be crossfire between multiple shooters.
Shell casings for assault rifles traced to several assault rifles littered the scene.
It appears that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
So there appears to have been several armed combatants here who were very actively involved," Philadelphia Police Department Officer Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit in the arm by a ricochet while playing outside her home in the residential neighbourhood of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
This is what I envision the women's Olympic gymnastics team to be, and for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspirational to many young girls of other colours.
The structure of this team, rounding out Aly Raisman who is Jewish and Madison Kocian who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American woman to win gold in an individual all-around event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing the pinnacle of this sport, but this is not what gymnastics classes look like across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts on the team. Also, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily compete in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). The list can go on and on.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
It is at these clubs that the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to make gymnastics training more affordable and accessible to the communities aun countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly Black and Hispanic) and coached national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for health as well as academic and career success.
It's the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It's so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you fass you motivate so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their journey to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents want to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract compulsorily, saying the NHS was in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first interns are to be given a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working to improve care at inhospitable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's Residents' Committee, said in a statement last night: "Residents continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining before the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks were met with reluctance on the part of the government to engage and sometimes deafening silence.
This came on the heels of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the residents".
If he fails to do so, the residents have made it clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April saw nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments postponed as nurses and specialists were brought in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better final weekly pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged the junior doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said, "Industrial action achieves nothing of little but puts a strain on already overstretched teams and service providers and only causes worry, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Residents' Committee and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as secondment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-a-day drug after it was recommended by regulators that it be given to more people for a longer period.
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeat heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for as little as 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people have a heart attack each year and a quarter of these have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by build-ups of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaques.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot breaks apart, it can flow through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, made by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots less likely to form.
NICE's draft guidance, published today, recommends taking 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg of twice-daily aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said, "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of having another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By provisionally recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who may benefit.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report for corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, a damning government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivities about ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption kingpin, said voter intimidation based on religious motives was so bad that police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card to prove their identity at elections.
Currently, a voter only has to give their name and address.
The report suggests putting non-removable ink on a person's finger when they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to municipal records and decisions made by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but should also protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman allegedly "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him."
As many as 300 votes were either dubious or the result of impersonation, where a person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarmist about fraudulent postal voting - where older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the carrying of ID cards to prove identity
His report says: "Evidence was mounted that pressure was placed on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, particularly women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of their elders, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of 'politically correct' oversensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing postal ballots to stop "election harvesting".
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and welfare fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once they have cast their vote to prevent someone voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic postal vote.
Prohibit political activists from processing full postal votes and envelopes from postal votes.
Giving police the power to set up barriers around voting stations.
An amendment to the law to facilitate a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in electoral wards (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that voters go into polling booths alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy ineligible due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was pleaded guilty on a number of grounds - as per the stringent requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticised the ineffective "ticking off" checks by the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
Our country carries a proud heritage as the Mother of Parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens that reputation.
Mad about Kate's cycling lookalike and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been beside themselves this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has emerged as a formidable lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer to feature her own famous doppelganger - at least not if social media is to be believed.
In honour of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US archery team Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling circuit, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-list celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
US archery team member Brady Ellison caused an onslaught on Twitter after pictures of him looking uncannily like the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got in on the craze on social media, admitting that he's been told he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, with the exception of the facial hair," Brady shared with the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take centre stage even more this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be able to pass as a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Taking it up a gear: this user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova exhibits more than just the tanned skin and blonde hair of actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities too
Theory put forward: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's resemblance
One Twitter user declared her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Indeed, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to actress Laura Linney's, and gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to Bring It On star Gabrielle Union's.
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the dr 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of the CBC's live broadcast of the Olmypic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "came off like pong" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more "colour", could be heard saying, "That little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost it, baby."
Too excited, went off like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the swim relay 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the audio and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, " Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't get that they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the final women's 4 x 200m freestyle relay as, " That little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost it, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard with many taking him to task
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #disgusted.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, issued a live apology for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for airing the comment about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate choice of wording, we're sorry it happened."
CBC ended up apologising over 90 times to people who responded to the remark via Twitter
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on MacDonald's behalf
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologised and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be aired.
We were quick to apologise to our viewers on air and our followers on social media last night.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance and not about her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised on air and attempted to justify his remark, stating that it was not his intention for it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologise for the comment I made after the women's swimming relay on the CBC Olympic broadcast, he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Shoppers in Primark outraged by woman shamelessly trying on underwear in middle of shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman removed her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
To make matters worse, she eyed how she looked in them, took them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried on four pairs of pants at a shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried on the pants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mystery woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, " People couldn't believe what they were seeing."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of pants from the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass."
"Everyone stared as she took the panties off again, which she obviously didn't like because she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more pairs of pants before finally deciding she didn't like anything, putting her clothes back on and walking out.
"She didn't seem to mind anyone watching her - or thinking about the person who might possibly buy the pants she had tried on."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home pants that another person had on and they hadn't been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "From what I understand, staff tried to pull the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as well."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out another woman had them on and took them off again and they hadn't been washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone shop on Tuesday 9 August."
All products in question have been pulled from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com might make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your robber.
If you are approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the groin with your knee and, as the attacker doubles over in pain, twist the weapon out of his hands. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while pointing the weapon at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift your weight onto the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi demonstrates it.
But remember, the safest thing to do in a robbery is to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places for a guidebook
A British traveller put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was about to get into.
But the experiment, which was made into a film called "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", revealed some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but there is actually more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Travelling through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting gut bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked off left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by travelling the world eating weird as well as wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to toilet flush buttons, the task definitely put his immune system to the test
In the film he shared, "Even as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms, muddy water."
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer reading of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was one Russian toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer reading was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy products manufacturer Valio produced a travel film, The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows bacteria counts in various places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "It's close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything in here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Valio, a Finnish dairy products manufacturer.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help promote gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valio's Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorming sessions that ended with us saying "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that were easier to get Ian to lick and others that were quite difficult.
I'm glad we captured some of those dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular with gastrointestinal wellness and 58 per cent said they at least occasionally use products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.
Anti-social family destroys council flat in Saltash, Cornwall before delogation
An anti-social family left their council flat with £50,000 worth of damage following a delogation for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing association employees found the property in an irreparable state.
There were gaping holes in the walls, wooden floorboards had been ripped open, rubbish was strewn across the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been relocated and are now believed to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the flat was beyond repair.
She said, "It has been an absolute nightmare for people here and my view is that people don't need to live like this.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be seen as a not so nice part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons living in the flat in the meantime and police said the terror inflicted by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy agreement, was given an anti-social behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in some rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Wooden floorboards were ripped up in the property, which had been used to deal drugs in the past
Neighbours said they saw them fighting in the street and police had to be called regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made hell.
One testified, "They didn't give a damn about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we hear the police say here are unbelievable.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they've finally gone, it's going to be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager for Cornwall Housing, testified that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house, to which police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the communal house.
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing will consider.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and her actions must have been terrible for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who have bravely approached us with the information.
I hope this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the house's bedrooms after it was delogated
Property management workers will now have to clear away piles of rubbish that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash totalling £1,700.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was for a headstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being left without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were covered in graffiti.
Police say they will delog tenants who do not comply with the house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogation was a clear warning to other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.
"This goes out to those who think they can behave without self-reproach as well as those who have been harmed by such behaviour," she said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour who will continue to work with partners to keep our communities safe.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet overflies beach
Sunbathers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane made an incredible dive
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk.
This was the moment terrified tourists begin to panic after a low-flying jet plunges over a crowded beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within touching distance above sunbathers on the stretch of beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers jumped to their feet as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, not initially seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It passed really low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it felt like the plane was coming down on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that it was the only way to spot them.
The spokesman said the jet was flying slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by nearby wildfires, however the air force insisted that safety was not compromised at any time.
Wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, including the deaths of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke from the fire - which limited his visibility
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join IS last year, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after planning to leave the war-torn country and return to Britain, according to her family.
"One can only hope that the one good thing is - as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to discourage people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other east London schoolgirls boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if she wins election
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid is convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will nominate the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's successor.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause turmoil with a new nominee.
Garland is the chief judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
Treats wants nude calendar for 'women and for men'
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from oldschool Playboys because "Playboy is for men.
I do it for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to get back to depicting timeless and classic nudity that both women and men feel comfortable with and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to litter it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMenMiddleAged, this statement derives from recent data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials eager to embrace the novelty of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are in all likelihood between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely group of buyers.
It's not hordes by hobby collectors either - it's emotional: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's findings true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesticulating wildly before stopping, holding my hands and saying something authoritative like, "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a closer look.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings that once housed independent vendors - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and disposition by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is in London for a day for a meeting and walks through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"'I guess so,' he says.
'I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snapshot, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a substantial number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they came out and re-buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, that came out when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a bit too young to buy," he says.
Agreeing that those who buy records tend to be introverts who like to spend time alone, he adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I've had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in record revival devotees of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realise that record shops offer a comforting community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offence to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, items that evoke happy youthful memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or owning material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
It's like that for me as a collector and I think it's like that for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to keep yourself mentally occupied.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member flutters from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably be looking very worried while flicking through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" to the revival.
"Someone came in here just recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people who are just starting to come in.
Fopp, which has almost an entire floor dedicated to records, has a more diverse crowd than I walk in.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz blares from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the shop for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She is window shopping rather than doing a bulk purchase.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not really an option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is...' she drifts off with an amorous sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I give the appearance of eyeing the denim hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls cluster around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "plate art".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research found YouGov's findings to be true, they do not take into account, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in real life, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings strolling through Berwick Street record shops and flicking through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake presenter towering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was held by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French court rejects bid to demolish shops in jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be razed because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which posed fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals provided by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further argued that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide shelter and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people running the 72 temporary shops, but acknowledged that the Calais prefecture's concerns were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said the food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than simply feeding people "living in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas would provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is run on a non-profit basis and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counselling for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
Two aid agencies, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Great Britain takes silver in rugby 7s after Fiji masterclass takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in 7s rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle on Thursday night in the form of Fiji as they were beaten by a score of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji issued a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, moving up, line-running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of silver - Great Britain's fourth on the day - and they could well be proud of their efforts in the tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' emphatic defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could backfire on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form on this form.
It might be a consolation for GB - but probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult road behind them.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every match at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started beautifully, bouncing off GB's attacks for fun.
It felt like running into moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell an Co. The World Series winners went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau rushed over in the corner.
With four minutes left to play Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of a man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal but it only held up Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua laid a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 to GB.
Nakarawa added another since the restart and there was still over a minute to play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou burst through more weak tackling from the GB team and charged to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 by the break.
It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
So it is.
GB made fundamental changes at half time and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good by first half standards, until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton kicked a try for GB, scoring a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favour of the South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the dying seconds.
The whistle blew, Fiji embraced and GB kicked crushingly to the turf.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals and Great Britain edged out South Africa in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton broke the line with some impressive footwork to score under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-Aside team, secured the win - and the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row victory by battle with coach's cancer
There will be no more emotinal gold than at these Games and that's saying something.
From the first stroke of the oars to the last, 220 hard heaves that will go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found extra meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was just the two of them at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all present as they rowed to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the coxless double, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not a complete reflection of the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes all the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would even survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, in the off-season, which kept the disruption to a minimum, if that's even the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would do.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a challenge in itself, but this makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to work through his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a deployment to Afghanistan, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week. That might be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just reiterates how much it means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen was shouting "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next week, her own to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.

Bulgaria posts first inflation in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest figure (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) measured by the CPI was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Year-to-date inflation (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, price increases were observed in the following groups of consumer goods compared to the previous month: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); Transport (1.8%); Recreation and culture (6.3%); Restaurants and hotels (1.2%); Miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices were unchanged from the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to race.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identities in ways that border on the absurd.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps make their way into the public domain.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accused of the app promoting blackface or pushing white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when it suggested some users use a filter that gave them slit eyes, fake teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage was widely reported on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as an homage to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism found the filter reminiscent of hurtful stereotypes.
Others strongly objected to the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been taken to a pejorative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company crossing these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems embroiled in an endless diversity and inclusion struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's a lot harder for things like that to go unnoticed than it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account urged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticised the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have diverse representation of people of other skin colours in their workforce so they can make decisions like this," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people of other skin colours working there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything against it."
Others share her opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce, pointing to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources executive to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion efforts.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say this is not O.K."
Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee finds
Military personnel at the United States Central Command altered intelligence information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defence Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that directs American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information typically signed off by senior Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders," noted Republican House member Ken Calvert.
The leadership failures at Centcom extend to the very top of the organisation.
The ten-page report details consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although it provides no direct evidence that top government officials under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and testimony before Congress were significantly more positive than factual," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is clear," Republican Congressman Mike Pompeo of Kansas said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command top brass altered intelligence reports to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after it was leaked to them that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of Islamic State reports.
The report released on Thursday will be completed with more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigation of the Centcom reports by the Defence Department's inspector general is underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly constrained process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, House of Representatives member Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
That process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave inordinately little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a "particular political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were released on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general that began after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, indicated in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he also indicated that "experts sometimes do have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a contentious discussion of these important national defence issues."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an assertion now made by a growing number of members of the Defence Department).
However, the allegations of the past year have raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticisms regarding intelligence on the Islamic State are reminiscent of disputes from more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then administration of George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, envisioned only a small occupation force in Iraq and spent little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government sources, Mr Hooker's team found that, contrary to government claims, air strikes against Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terror group's finances because they had been operating makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not made public, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
Gen. Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth match in women's hockey, showdown with Britain looms
A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team in a match Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, said she can't remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their goals.
She does know this, though: The Americans are 4-0 in Olympic competition and tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0.
Great Britain and the United States will meet in the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the two will finish first and second respectively within their group of six teams.
The first-placed team will spend a little longer avoiding the strong Dutch women, who top the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's match, the Americans have created a surprising buzz with their track record, four years after finishing last of 12 at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first had her hands on a hockey stick at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), becoming a USA national player at 16, the youngest in team history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, failing to qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and with that things started to change for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We have been able to turn the tide completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the match with a backhand strike from close range.
India had entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprising tenacity and kept the score at 1-0 till the third quarter when Bam took the game into her hands.
She executed a sprint with the flat ball down the left flank, then moved to the middle and lofted the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for USA goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who has recorded a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
Amid the frenzy of the Olympics, the zen of the trampoline.
Wherever you are, however late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a frantic relay race between competition and aspiration.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the spat between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob, could well have been among those household names broadcast in prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is competing for gold in Olympic trampolining.
The Olympic flame does not light every event the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not universally recognised: Air Pistol Shooting, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have breaststroke and long may it reign.
But if I might humbly make a case for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed didn't know it was even an Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampolining and had one athlete make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadians those for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will be defending their gold medals from London this year.
Trampolining has a certain underdog charm, partly because to the unenlightened ear it sounds more fitting for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, meaning "springboard."
Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shooting almost 30 feet in the air and having to perform a series of falling moves (spins, pikes and flips) before landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time" according to the official Olympic programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go further, faster, up and over in their pursuit of gold, sometimes all the way to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the exit wall, but in the television broadcast, another taunting target: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to move even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I myself find somewhat tiring when watching these Games.
From this, the trampoline offers a respite.
The vector of the trampoliner is up.
Forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is competition here too, not without difficulty of course, but during the exercise there is no frantic attack on the target, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as competition at the Olympics can get.
The women's qualifying and finals will take place Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days, starting at 14.00.
Amid the Olympics mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If raising awareness can only be achieved by ogling and objectifying male athletes - as US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley's gasping new fan base awaits.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a US ally.
Violent protests in Ethiopia.
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have met violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say tens of protesters were killed in gunfire during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have rocked the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos of the protests, believed to be from last year or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks while forcing them to do a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights body is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is Africa's most populous country after Nigeria and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model of democracy - human rights organisations have continually cited government repression - opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled or imprisoned, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could be about to change.
"When you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it erupts," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
Grievances abound, covering everything from land use to a stranglehold on power by the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now control 100 per cent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle over this jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearm.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate using social media, as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved.
Even when the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does periodically, especially during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at sensing early signs of discontent and using special envoys to work opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take Mr Meles's place for relatively obscure reasons.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that analysts say appeared to have been botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing crackdowns, many protesters were killed, although fewer than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But clearly this has not prevented the Ethiopian government's internal grudges from intensifying.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-run businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr Abdi said, "is a very fine balancing act."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terror group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his fellow campaigners, who are scrambling to protect him during an eventful period, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements he may not have meant.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr Trump rowed back on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not mean to imply that the president and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply being sarcastic.
The tweet was the antithesis of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was completely serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would have none of it.
The latest storm of criticism has been raining down on Mr Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economy because of falling poll numbers.
Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton gave speeches on the state of the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to the subject.
Reaching out on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.
In late July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, however, he later explained "of course I was being sarcastic".
This method allows Mr Trump to push the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how certain messages are received by his fans, how they're received, and then if necessary "clarify" depending on the reaction. " said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of toning down the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll numbers have continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed a lead by wide margins in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a neck-and-neck race in Florida.
While Mr Trump generally tries to avoid apologising for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he has been the focus of increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal fellow campaigners in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying are legitimate political comments," Mr. Giuliani said when asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in that sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them backbenchers, totally false and that is why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively take control of the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of campaign rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of harping on his every word and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to understand him, saying, "They can't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr Trump's apology as just further proof that he was unfit to be president.
Once priced out of the market, cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices pushed it out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, the shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly unpretentious atmosphere.
The coffee is still good, too.
Verb's new owner is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu features sandwiches with bacon and cheese, and there are toppings like capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he has noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"A lot of old customers have also been pushed out of Williamsburg by prices," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would make the trip.
After the Verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realised it was the coffee and the culture at the Verb that I liked," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the Verb began in 2003.
He would go there before work and inevitably order the same thing every time.
"I'd come in quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they'd prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he held no grudge about the soap shop taking over the old storefront.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the café's cold-brew coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we'll still take them up on their offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional, Polish residents have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to display it soon so his new neighbours will feel welcome.
The location has other advantages as well.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold-brew coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favourites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said walking into the place and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the Depression in "a bountiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
A foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the US, while Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", is about life in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal", to be published by Harper on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills diner in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crashed in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive chunks, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it fitting for a discussion about food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, meatloaf and bean bread.
They were made with one ingredient and something cheap to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field hands and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" charts the ways in which the country dealt with no longer being the land of milk and honey.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mystery foods like breads and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the centre of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar mixtures were tried as caloric and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even common kitchen sense.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from the era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition at lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelman continues, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions don't go together.
It was typical of many of the home cooking recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country's eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and rise to the challenge of transforming mush like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Particularly tasty are the accounts of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He dined in a nearly gilded dining room and wore a dinner jacket.
He was delightfully out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had not his wife Eleanor urged him to make an example of his stomach.
As described in the book, Mrs Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours resulted in the White House producing the dullest food in Washington, but also one of the most drearily prepared."
Many of the Great Depression era ways of dealing with food were discarded once the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple said in writing the book they came to better understand Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the cream puff incident.
After the plates at Eisenberg's were cleared, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give humble recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone somewhat reluctantly dipped a spoon into the gooey brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe went back for seconds three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Gilead to get legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US district judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover legal costs it incurred from its hepatits C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was relieved of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a US judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on Merck's part, including perjury and other unethical actions.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to a waiver of costs incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of lab work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the town left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters holed up inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are carrying out clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned USD 10.75 million and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly USD 5.3 million in speaking fees; the former Secretary of State reported income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, released his tax returns for the last ten years with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"The ball is in your court," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic presidential nominee's disclosure.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already let it be known that his refusal raises questions about assets, his donations to charities, his business practices and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already pounced on the issue, releasing a video on the internet on Friday in which high-profile Republicans call on Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last few decades and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist on Friday cited a number of tax lawyers and accountants who indicated that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a provision named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subject to an IRS tax audit and that Trump was "afraid" of voters, not tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return showed that they received only USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main financial investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons paid tax on dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilli powder, fireworks boost Tanzania's elephant conservation
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to deter elephants from entering human-inhabited settlements - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea years ago, has worked with the US Nature Conservancy to step up its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have seen a change in attitude within these communities, whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants in the process," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell expressed in a statement.
The first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
Chilli powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker in a condom, the end of which is twisted shut except for the fuse.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
A whiff is usually enough to scare the elephant away.
A final option is a thrower who shoots a golden rain firework into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli prefix after 'Arab' demand - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli prefix listed because, according to a staff member, Arab guests had "requested it".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" vented his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-selection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call centre.
Seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this happened in Germany in this very hotel chain is even more shameful.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response on the internet, with people calling the whole thing a scandal.
Some insinuated that the Kempinski Hotel had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the posh Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly denied all accusations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the shortlist," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski Hotel spokesperson as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
Trouble started when police officers tried to disperse the students, leading to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to proposals by Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students will be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spray-painting graffiti against interim president Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests occurred days after demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote to recall her.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly soars to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 per cent year-on-year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in doing business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade boost was achieved through shipments of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian mission abroad issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists to Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilisation in good condition, " he said.
Scotland's Callum Skinner storms home as Briton takes cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio last night as the British team defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch a victory from favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shock victory four years ago as Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March despite Hoy's retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing starter Jamie Staff.
They did so in time for Hindes to emerge.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man they stuck with when they saw potential in the Scot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just behind after his round, but Kenny put the team ahead and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he intentionally fell on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted that statement and no objection came from England's rivals.
With such a resounding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands."
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We've come off so badly in so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we are in for a successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is within the realms of possibility that he repeats Hoy's win of three Olympic gold medals in one event.
That would mean a haul of six gold medals and one silver for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born on that day).
That would equal Hoy's.
Kenny competes next in the sprint, which starts today and will run over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for now."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win it alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal event of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man four-kilometre race.
They finished in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final rounds (22.42) take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins is sure to be in the spotlight.
He had argued with officials yesterday before qualifying when officials called him over to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time of 4:13.260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and bring home a bevy of medals.
After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were lowered for Rio.
Dramas played out in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, judging by the first night of competition at the Velodrome, it looks very much like GB's now legendary reputation, peaking at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter in doubt due to cancellation of energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium smelter in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake as the plant operator is to cancel the energy supply contract, cancelling all supply agreements, the supplying energy company has announced.
The move followed the Victorian government's decision earlier this year to stop providing subsidies to run the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in the event of a closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The move follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the major aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three other owners to cancel their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller stakes.
"AGL expects to continue to operate the Portland facility, which will mean continued physical demand for power from the smelter," the company said.
AGL further said the contracts were so-called "hedges" that should have taken effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"As such, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in FY17," the power supplier said.
Any potential revenue impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently constrained by forecasts of strong forward markets for wholesale power prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its financial statements to the tune of $187 million in "anticipation of termination".
Alcoa said the decision to derecognise the contracts would "undermine Alcoa's ability... to operate the smelter or provide power to the smelter".
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have taken effect from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are warning of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as a power producer, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and walked at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover reveal was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and in the presence of everyone's favourite showbiz uncle and Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, and ending with a classic twist: they all have a surprise party planned.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest delivered the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on an 8 a.m. slot), but Kris had to let her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Looking ahead to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have them beat as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is in a league of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a size more akin to a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the tome's 832 pages, 615 were advertising).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga did the honours.
But even on the off chance that Ms Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though all of that applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's standing in the fashion world has always been somewhat strained.
In June, the one-time Victoria's Secret model criticised Stephanie Seymour Jenner and fellow model Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
Those feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner appearing on the Vogue cover.
But harping on the displeasure seems to miss the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
She is literally a supermodel.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your foundation for Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures she took of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV. Presumably just to see her sister Kourtney and her sister's children.
Community justice centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable are turned away from community justice centres each year as the sector braces for the impact of further funding cuts on already overstretched transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violent crime and those without funds for unjust delogations and the like - are already turned away when they apply for free legal advice and assistance.
Municipal legal services, already over-utilised, are gearing up for further cuts.
As of June next year, these law centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Queesland Community Law Centres Director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centres found that thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that without a repeal of the federal government's decision, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community justice centres are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from vital services you need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows they can't get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of Queenslanders in need of help will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney-General and Federal Minister for Justice and Queensland Senators George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need with legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to increase funding for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, as well as for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after staffer allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after being told that its campaign manager for North Carolina pulled a firearm on a staffer while they were travelling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign software programmer in the state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realising that " it wasn't going to happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, " pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and jammed the barrel into the back of Vincent's knee," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Guns do not have to be fired to cause harm," Bordini stated.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gun enthusiasts - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints judges.
Trump's campaign clarified that the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not inciting violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of fiduciary duty and from Philip for assault and permanent emotional harm.
Trump's press secretary Hope Hicks could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign staffer.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc, 16-CS-14300, Superior Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring regeneration and prosperity not only to our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this represented Heathrow's greatest attraction, just as it did back in London in 2012 when we went to great lengths to ensure all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating new opportunities for local residents and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport area.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not individuals.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11bn infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two busiest walkways in the world.
Now they are poised to deliver a third catwalk, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time that we channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and in doing so secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in 'cat and mouse game' over ad blocking
For businesses that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad blocking amount to a "cat and mouse game", according to one of the software makers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ads on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying users could update their filters in the programme to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its desktop site would change the coding related to its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bypassers has been going on since ad blockers were invented," and that it's possible Facebook will come up with a new solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fray is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, some 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times as many in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile ads account for 84 per cent of Facebook's ad revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue that Facebook feels the investment of such a move is worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad preferences tool" to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that was not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we've focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in a suspected suicide in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the road in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, Vaud police testified.
It is apparent that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, tried to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to the incident to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers will be charged.
Was a collision avoidable?
That is something for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking on the motorway in the dark - it was ruled that drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the motorway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter after she ran over and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unforeseeable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with further information about Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, might once have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still continued to rotate slowly.
The model also shed light on the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more arid areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 per cent dimmer.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its dayside to the Sun for nearly two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was probably once habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapour was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing too little say in the team's decision-making process.
Alternate president/general manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed the decision and noted that the club will immediately begin a search for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, which it needs, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him nothing but the best in the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his debut season with the Avalanches in 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Industrial action over pay for North Sea oil workers is suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services provider Wood Group have been sporadic on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
'We will be holding a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next year, to re-address the issues.
The unions said their latest strike, which is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market pressures.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 per cent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give it the room it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has laid off thousands of people for its part and announced plans to exit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes to hit the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates as well as how the rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades star cluster lies 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognisable starspot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger stars pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades "ballet" we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There's still a lot ahead that we'd like to learn more about, such as how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dancing shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotation rates in three newspaper articles that will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
