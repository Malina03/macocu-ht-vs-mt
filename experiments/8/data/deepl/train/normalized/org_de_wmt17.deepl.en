Jennifer Aniston: I always get pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made that unmistakably clear in an interview.
"I'm always pigeonholed or have labels put on me from the outside that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly, I don't really care about those things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the latest "Cosmopolitan."
The magazine says that the actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose bun and Mexican food.
The question of having children drives her up the wall: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is no Child's Play" Aniston stars as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be released on 25 August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a little diversion with a horseback ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their end of the day, they chased home to the feed troughs at a fast gallop.
One kilometre at that pace, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And that was the end of his riding career.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back around horses.
He let himself be guided around the ALRV grounds with his family, he didn't even get on a horse for photo purposes.
It was Langer's first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
There is no lack of awards for the likeable sportsman.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen on Saturday, he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.
Along with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
Among those honoured are track and field athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsledder Meinhard Nehmer, judoka Frank Wieneke, show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and, posthumously, handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sporting legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company wandered into the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was running.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big shots.
A comparison of Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
Underlying the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
That of the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it small in case of doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax and regulate the economy to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: "The state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up opportunities for the disadvantaged and needs money for that.
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close on the subject of infrastructure.
Infrastructure needs to be invested in, Trump and Clinton say almost word for word.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government investment programmes in infrastructure are classic Democratic policy and are strictly rejected, for example, by the anti-government Teaparty wing of the Republican Party.
So Trump could still face internal party debates.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and increase coal production in the USA.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment programme and demands: "One country will become the clean energy superpower and create millions of jobs."
"I think it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But it's not just infrastructure - the two rivals are not too far apart on international trade agreements either.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, neither wants to sign.
At the same time, neither wants to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They should also be better paid, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: one day he says the minimum wage must go up, the next he says it must not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is more likely to develop around the tax policies of the two camps.
On the one side is Trump, who wants to ease the burden on the economy and citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics say that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who at least wants to require the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience of sexual violence."
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby with her, no more than a year old.
One of them has put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with wide eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she notices that she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women who have fled alone and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences of sexual violence during her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: "Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home countries, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
This drives them away.
It continues on the run.
"That traffickers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, Bahr tells us.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not come into being voluntarily."
Many women are so used to not saying anything, she says.
"Or they don't dare to speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help themselves, more shelters are needed just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked if they knew of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered in the negative.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
In Swabia, too, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, there are floors or separate houses only for single women and their children in some shared accommodation.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central shelters exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also demands that women be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the committee says: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, there can be - ongoing - violence against women."
Washrooms, in particular, should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
The extent to which women feel this need for protection can be seen in the rush that there is for the house in Munich.
"Since word got out that we existed, we have had a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked and seriously injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife.
According to police yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the flat to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the flat, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old tried to calm her brother down.
However, she could not get him to leave the flat.
Therefore, she left the house with her partner.
They met the man's ex-girlfriend in the street.
When the two women entered the flat again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Brunswick's affordable housing?
The SPD and the Greens think: Investors should be held much more accountable in the future.
How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable flats in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "housing action plan" for the next council meeting.
But controversy is inevitable.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the low-cost housing?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD parliamentary group leader Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on municipal land must designate 20 per cent of all flats as social housing in future."
However, the low-cost flats can also be built in existing buildings.
The big point of contention in city hall, however, according to Bratmann, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent, but if possible 20 per cent of the flats as social housing on such sites."
A new urban housing subsidy programme, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, is supposed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the parliamentary groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to impose as few regulations as possible on investors.
The Left wants even tougher requirements for investors.
Regardless of this, Bratmann says, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is on the horizon.
If the action plan is implemented, it will create additional tasks for the building administration.
More staff will be needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the programme is not yet fully in place: after all, the approximately 1260 new flats were to be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 or so affordable flats whose subsidies will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 flats.
In order to prevent this, says Nicole Palm, spokesperson for planning policy, expiring bonds should be purchased by the city now.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing flats back into price control.
This is possible in Weststadt.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the Weststadt, time limits expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 flats could be brought back into price maintenance for affordable flats.
But the owners, the housing associations, don't want that.
If the number of social housing units in the Weststadt is drastically increased again, the goal of so-called mixing is distanced.
There should no longer be a concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few neighbourhoods.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board.
The CDU has concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But that does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - On Sunday, FC Barcelona will fight for the first step towards winning the title in the new football season.
The Catalans will face Sevilla FC away in the Spanish Supercup, with the return match taking place three days later at the Camp Nou.
The double winners will have to do without Neymar, who is playing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen will also be absent.
The German suffered a sprained knee ligament in training, which means that the question of a goalkeeper for Barca has been settled in favour of Claudio Bravo, at least for the time being.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been vying for number one status at Barcelona for the past two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision in this regard, giving way to Bravo in the league but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Ahead of the first competitive game of the new season, there are doubts about the fitness of the Spanish champions, who were humiliated 4-0 by Liverpool in a test match on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. also failed to really convince in the 3:2 test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, have to digest the 3-2 defeat after extra time in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and are aiming for a second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana."
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with eleven victories so far.
Ma Long to table tennis gold in a league of his own
Rio de Janeiro - China's Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world number one thus won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Championships, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and the Olympics.
The bronze medal went to Japan's Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it to the final and decided the title between themselves.
It was thus clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the individual title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to their own devices at the plate, with no coaches with them between sets or during time-outs.
They had retreated to the stands and let their charges go at each other alone in fair competition.
"The matches up to here I have played for my country."
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang had said logically.
After the match, gold and silver medallists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma only really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.
After that, he set the pace at the plate and only allowed Zhang a total of 13 points from then on.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected rousing match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking rallies to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze medal match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was treated by a doctor afterwards, and "in the end" had to settle for a bronze medal.
Incidentally, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had finished fourth in the Olympics at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits to ″violent problems″ in the election campaign
The US Republican leadership is plagued by massive worries about losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally cocky and confident multimillionaire expressed something like concern, correspondents reported.
After knocking out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians he was asking for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blaming false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his familiar media rant.
Republican strongholds shaky
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a SurveyUSA poll from June, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were tied.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not by the margin that is usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered vulnerable.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he would stop Clinton's advance: "The same way I've done it so far."
He added that this would "either be successful or I'm going to have a very, very nice, long holiday."
He was doing nothing other than "telling the truth."
If it's not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that's fine, Trump continued.
Then I'll go back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party has threatened to cut off funds to support Trump's campaign if he does not improve his poll numbers.
Instead, the party wants to give more support to Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympics: Brazen cheating in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's track and field athletes are facing trouble after the second doping scandal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Kenya has sent a coach home after an attempt to cheat during a doping control in the Olympic village.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had said that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample at the Olympic Village under the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported to Kenya's team management by doping control officers.
The IAAF, the world governing body, has requested information about the case from the IOC in order to launch its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," an IAAF statement said.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and claimed to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed for it," Kenya's Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi said.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency's training control list.
Ferguson Rotich had finished fourth in the 800 metres at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan head of the athletics delegation, Michael Rotich, had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny by the IOC for some time after numerous doping offences.
When the IOC announced more than 2000 doping target tests before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be particularly targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the Summer Games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping policies are compliant with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by ARD, there have been repeated accusations that doping substances are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a considerable mentality of sports cheating.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for an investigation in Kenya similar to the one he had carried out in Russian athletics.
It was proven that there was widespread and systematic doping in this sport.
As a result, Russia's track and field athletes were banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With them a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Maria.
In the pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra led by Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it has a very Latin American flavour.
There are many Latin American ingredients in its tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an aging Maria.
She wistfully remembers her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria acts and dances.
The role of Maria has always fascinated me.
Firstly because she is musically exceptional!
And then there is Maria's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course she's also naïve, and very passionate.
"She is very much like me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in his every move, in his looks, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to be able to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important in general!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, back then the Puerto Ricans went to New York and the New Yorkers didn't want them.
It's the same themes, and they're just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and World Foundation.
In the short term, the Kurdish community in Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, there could even be "several hundred thousand," believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Because of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's harsh actions after the attempted coup, the Kurdish Community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, and in the medium term, several hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, the association's president, to the "Welt" newspaper on Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing inside Turkey, he said.
After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would join them.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi towns.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave the country.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
He added that a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics was also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in recent months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
The branding as Gülen followers destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who don't conform and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, including Kemalists and secularists, by the way," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and Education Foundation, told Die Welt.
According to the newspaper, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Turks were already the largest group of people recognised as entitled to asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persecution before the coup.
As of 30 June, they accounted for 11,386 people, or almost 29 per cent of all those recognised as entitled to asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Those entitled to asylum according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically, i.e. individually persecuted by the state.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "Go where it hurts."
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: Locals get nothing out of the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they have understood.
In 2021, the parliament in Schwerin decided at the beginning of the year that the state elections will not take place at the end of the summer holidays.
Because it doesn't get any sillier than it used to: summer holidays, heat and a state parliament election campaign - it's a clash.
The locals who are to be convinced by the election campaigners are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, it is difficult to find helpers to put up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end.
Until 4 September 2016, the election day and last day of the holidays, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to endure one more election campaign that just misses the people.
The hot phase, if you can call it that at all, has just begun.
And there is also something at stake: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in the polls.
It will be exciting to see how strong newcomer AfD performs and what remains in the end that is suitable for a coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous election campaign, except for his large posters.
He travels around the country handing out roses and chatting a little with people, just as his legendarily taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's flourishing.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do it," has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will now probably cost him his nice office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it's like to campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
It has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the north-east.
But the target group was not right; there were more North Rhine-Westphalians, Berliners and Saxons than Mecklenburgers and Western Pomeranians.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently complained to NDR.
But it also does no one from other corners of Germany any harm to listen to Angela Merkel for once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely does without the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.
According to Kokert, this now only plays a "subordinate role."
The CDU/CSU has also noticed that its base in the countryside is crumbling away and that it has to make a great effort to reconnect with the people.
It is like the Left, the SPD and the Greens: there are hardly any in the country.
However, CDU election campaigner Kokert's advice to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to engage in a particularly committed election campaign.
In the polls, the Social Democrats were most recently 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still won clearly with 35.6 per cent, ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven per cent in the polls, are likely to make it into the Landtag.
They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday hardship and are shifting most of their election campaign to the internet.
"Online election campaigning" is what Claudia Müller, the state chairperson, calls it.
Otherwise, Green campaigners go in search of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently cruising through the Mecklenburg lakes on a houseboat and finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "An electoral holiday in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment."
B27 renovation: restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B27 is being rehabilitated.
There is universal praise for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and does not end until around 8 pm.
"They did everything pretty snappily," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.
They're a super team.
There are no delays either.
The construction site was moved south on schedule at the beginning of the week at the halfway point, and everything should be ready by the end of October.
There is also praise for the obligingness of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up temporary entrances.
Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted, thus restoring the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation within the town has eased.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen again.
Evasive traffic through the town seems to be decreasing.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says Florian King, the deputy head of the main office responsible for the traffic management of the redevelopment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise because many people were looking for sneaky routes and trusted their navigation system rather than the signposts.
As a result, some trucks got lost in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not adhered to either, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable speeding violations," says King, who went to the site himself to check the situation.
There were already two to three speeding per minute.
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in the 30 km/h zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to be shown their cards.
But anyone you ask will tell you that the B27 renovation has led to a drop in their sales.
However, some are affected more and some less.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer," i.e. who produce for other companies, are hardly affected by the rehabilitation.
At Autohaus Maier, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "slight decline at most," but also admits that of course "the walk-in customers are missing."
The pubs along the street are the hardest hit.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly the Krone, speaks plainly.
This is already threatening their existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have been "hit hard."
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro of turnover.
He puts the loss of turnover at "well over 50 per cent."
The road rehabilitation had "set his business back by two years."
He had to lay off half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them had been laid off, the politicians would have reacted differently.
Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner about whether there could be financial compensation by saying that the restaurant otherwise profited from the advantages of its location on the B 27. Now it would have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the redevelopment.
Göhner knows of other districts where this was handled more generously.
Despite all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been here since 1715, he points out.
He can understand that other regulars are less likely to stop by now because of the complicated traffic routing.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the renovation work is finished.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being tinkered with in the name of fighting terrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerated status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière plays the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They do not overburden anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is interested in results and in an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière let a little time pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more comprehensive.
Some things are already known, announced and envisaged: The fact that a new security authority is to take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on air passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is making a second attempt at proposals that could not be made with the SPD until now: He wants to criminalise sympathy advertising for terror groups and take away the German passport from jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
Nevertheless, he considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.
Some of them are quite serious: he plans fast-track deportations and more possibilities to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country are to have their smartphones checked beforehand and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse off than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some of it also seems half-baked and leaves questions unanswered.
And on some points - the unequal treatment of tolerated persons, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But there is no denying that the attackers in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people are worried about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that concerned people deeply could not be ignored, even during election campaigns.
Internal security has moved enormously into focus.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is great uncertainty.
And yes, there are election campaigns coming up.
The CDU/CSU and SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have been at loggerheads.
First, there was a nasty argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demanded a ban on burqas and a renunciation of dual citizenship.
Here, too, De Maizière is trying to strike a conciliatory note.
He does not believe in turning away from the double passport.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It would not make sense to reopen it.
And he has constitutional concerns about a burqa ban.
Whether his own package is constitutionally sound in all respects and whether it is really "reasonable" for the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make its mark on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel has cautiously signalled his willingness to talk, saying: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to further increase security.
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly.
Despite the diesel scandal, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But things are not going well in all markets.
There is a fuss about a term in the recall campaign.
Volkswagen starts the second half of the year on a more subdued note in terms of deliveries.
Despite the diesel scandal, Europe's largest carmaker can still report a plus in the year to date thanks to its many brands and some markets that are doing well.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again weighed on overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449100 cars in July, 1.8 per cent fewer than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 per cent below the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost one sixth.
Brand Sales Director Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July primarily to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there had been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions."
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also had a negative impact, a spokeswoman explained.
In the USA, where the emissions scandal first escalated, there was also a further decline.
The Chinese market is a big support for VW.
All in all, the main brand affected by the diesel scandal in Lower Saxony continues to come off lightly: after the first seven months, only a 0.9 per cent drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles is on the books.
Group Sales Director Fred Kappler was able to report a further increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated emissions tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling in about 2.5 million cars to be modified in the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW affirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The carmaker issues a "warranty-like" certificate to the customers after the conversion, but does not speak of a "warranty," as it was said in company circles on Friday.
The reason, they said, was legal subtleties.
Focus" had reported that Volkswagen was now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models after all.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The transport ministry confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has given a guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "guarantee," according to company sources.
With the broad term "guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers could, for example, come to a workshop six months after the conversion with engine damage - and attribute this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer's interest to avoid uncertainty about possible warranty regulations in the case of other damage that has nothing to do with the emissions scandal.
That is why VW does not use the term "warranty."
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will charge penalty interest to rich savers in the future - as the second bank in Germany.
Bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday: "We are only talking about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or call money accounts."
The Association of German Banks speaks of an isolated case and does not see this as a signal: normal savers "do not have to fear paying penalty interest for their savings."
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay it 0.4 per cent penalty interest.
Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge this fee back to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in current or call money accounts from September.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in future," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilise.
"They are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 per cent," the bank boss said.
"I can't put down 4,000 euros for every million."
He said he was now passing on the costs according to the "polluter pays" principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the Raiffeisenbank's vaults would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want a fifth!" said the bank CEO.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria said: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks."
To bear them alone is "not possible in the long term from a business point of view."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch made headlines in 2014 with penalty interest rates for deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong for that."
A banker said that in Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is somewhat more opulently endowed in terms of wealth."
"That can become a problem for a small bank" if it herds money for free.
The Gmund Cooperative Bank, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge a reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Cooperative Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold for going into the negative vis-à-vis private customers is very, very high."
Competition is tough and there is a threat of investors migrating to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not put up with this on a broad scale.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let it get him down.
"I'll keep my eyes on the World Championships, stay confident and keep fighting," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the Sugarloaf.
"To be honest, I find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He would have to calmly analyse the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial Championships in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I will take a close look at everything we have changed recently," he said.
"That includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) over the 54.5km on Wednesday.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's winning streak came to an end in the quarter-finals in Rio. The world number 32 from Metzingen missed the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament with a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no. 34).
34) clearly missed the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who has been plagued by back problems, was only able to get through her serve once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had a chance to make it to the final round.
The Australian Open winner met Britain's Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
The last time there were two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of a Summer Games was in 1992.
Never before has a German duo reached an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to profit from this.
The technology group is buying the start-up Beam, which specialises in this hobby.
Microsoft did not say on Thursday how much money it was paying for the takeover.
Beam only launched its service in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
They can watch others play, but also intervene themselves.
For example, they can give players missions to complete and enemies to face, as well as provide equipment.
Gaming giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to becoming a global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already paying attention.
The employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Nothing is expected to change for customers as a result of the takeover.
Beam will be integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's speeders need to get ready for the next generation of speed cameras: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being tested that are supposed to be particularly effective in convicting speeders.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from the Wiesbaden-based company Vitronic can be used, for example, at accident blackspots where it would be too dangerous for the police to carry out mobile measurements.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges under renovation with a temporary speed limit, there is often no infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile installation may be too dangerous or costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days in uninterrupted measuring operation, and the case data is transmitted in encrypted form via a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to detect all vehicles across several lanes at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as prohibitions of passage according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
When raised, the trailer can be moved with any car with a trailer coupling, according to the manufacturer.
To prevent it from being simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode so that the wheels disappear into the armoured and, incidentally, bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is supposed to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cameras: France recently reordered 100 units, following an order of 150 units last year.
Exemplary clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group" water association, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
A small Franconian drinking water association as a role model for the big water producers.
This was the original title of a report by the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation some time ago.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the special-purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria."
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for the association for 31 years, 28 of them as managing director.
Now he has retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, pumps about 150,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other towns and communities.
The current chairperson, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as water caretaker in 1985 and appointed managing director of the special-purpose association as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they have ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, the preparation of budgets, calculation of fees and contributions, and emergency operations at weekends," said the chairwoman.
As outstanding events, she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the purchase of a new central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no standstill and innovations have always been taken up, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Goeller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has put his heart and soul into his water association, and he has literally lived the water association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, he had been able to present the Veitenstein group's successful concept for nitrate reduction to the water forum of the Lower Franconia district as a true practitioner.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water keeper Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water keeper and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
He described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the special-purpose association as highlights from his point of view.
The greatest challenge and the most difficult assignment, however, was the burst pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
We had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply to Neubrunn could only be maintained once because the elevated tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she thought she would die.
But Tiago, who is now eight years old, has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that happened two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the luckiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's union with bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship crime in Bargteheide - man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally injured his partner in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) at around 10.45 am on Friday.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his partner," said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator is on the run, she said, and a public manhunt is underway for him.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be travelling by car.
The man is about 1.80 metres tall, muscular, tanned and bald.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is bald.
The man should not be approached directly.
He could still be carrying the weapon, according to the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police call it a "relationship crime."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not want to give any information about the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim at first; however, they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It is a homicide," they said.
"That is all we are saying at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operations squad (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs in the millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the green electricity subsidy are off the table.
Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition) that the exemption from the renewable energy levy for existing plants for so-called own power production in the German steel industry would remain in place.
"I am really pleased that we have finally been able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
According to the report, the European Commission had initially planned to make steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption pay.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry would face additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG levy of 20 per cent apply.
But even this would not be levied in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on generating its own electricity.
The status quo of the previous regulation would thus be largely fixed.
Gabriel's successful efforts were of particular importance for the steel industry.
"With regard to our 'Steel is the Future' campaign, this is a first step," he said.
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed up in the reform of emissions trading," IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel sector in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
The situation worsened last year when China, the world's largest producer, threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel are having an effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices had tended to stagnate again.
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp recently did not want to exclude the possibility of closing individual plants.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced 3.4 million tonnes of crude steel, a good six per cent less than in the same month last year, according to the German Steel Federation on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the volume produced now fell for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two per cent below the previous year's figure.
The association expects output to increase in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in her teacher training studies she took music as a subject, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizens' choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, happy and altogether more alive, she says.
At the same time, she is doing something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors' League.
Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To agree and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly challenge your lungs, you won't get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Singing is also an optimal hobby when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens' Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher status, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even people suffering from dementia remember events from long ago.
Singing also demands a special performance from the mind, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on one's own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practise in this way not to concentrate only on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in a choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in a choir.
Showing yourself: If I practise for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if they think they have little talent, advises Lenz.
After all, you're not singing alone - with 50 people singing, who can hear if you miss a note?
When looking for a suitable offer, seniors have various options, says Hackler.
If someone in your circle of acquaintances sings in a senior citizens' choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church warden directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.
If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask family, friends or neighbours for help with internet research.
Anyone who feels like singing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has a liberating effect - this applies to all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than males to cries of kittens
Biologists in Hanover have investigated what effect the cries of kittens have on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved in the same way.
Female cats can recognise the degree of arousal of kittens by the meowing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who think they are in great distress, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found out.
Male cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always in the same way.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited kittens are either not perceptible or not of importance for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult male and eight female cats from the MHH animal facility were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from kittens that were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
Despite the small sample, the researchers believe their results are significant.
"All females, even those that did not yet have offspring of their own, reacted differentially to the cries," said Konerding.
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when it played calls from the very excited kittens.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity, he said.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of females and males to baby sounds in humans.
Here, too, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to babies, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued for former football star Hakan Sükür in Turkey.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the attempted coup, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel between arch-rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual" is the order of the day.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted coup in July, the government claimed that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the attempted coup.
Football is not spared either.
The public prosecutor's office issued a warrant for the arrest of former star footballer Hakan Sükür.
Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, will remain in effect until October, it has had virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the nightly "democracy guards" in public places throughout the country to be over on Wednesday.
Sport - like the whole country - is divided between supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are traditionally not among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on this - regardless of whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of cup winners "Gala," Lukas Podolski will again be particularly important.
The Cologne player proved his sporting worth last season: with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 winner.
The Fanatik newspaper hailed him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season came to a conciliatory end for the record champions.
After the first-round knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" were also eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, they only managed sixth place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only opportunity to win something.
"We managed to do that and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For champions Besiktas, the playing year went better.
Mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for a 14th title with 26 goals this season as the Süper Liga top scorer.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florence and only on loan to Besiktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return after his European Championship holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario does want to come to us, he just has to say so," the trade magazine "Kicker" quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
To do so, however, the striker would have to be prepared to give up about a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at the Rio Olympics
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Yulia Stepanova will not be allowed to compete in Rio.
Other convicted track and field offenders can only laugh about it - they are competing for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Yuliya Yefimova, who had sued for her right to start shortly before the Games after a doping ban, was booed and booed mercilessly at her start (100 metres breaststroke).
It was a bizarre scene: she had strutted into the hall with a smile on her face and provoked the crowd with her performance.
When it was clear that she would not win the gold medal, the audience erupted into a storm of cheers.
But there are numerous other athletes who will compete at the Olympic Games in Rio despite their doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world's number one in the 100m in 9.80 seconds and is considered Usain Bolt's biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic and seven-time world champion had to serve a six-month ban in 2010 after she was found to have taken the painkiller oxycodone.
The 29-year-old defended herself by saying that she had had severe toothache after an operation.
Sandra Perkovic (discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 world champion and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was banned for six months.
The four furthest throws this year are to the credit of the big gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion in the 400 m, tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
Merritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was responsible.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world so far in the 200m and 400m.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any other athlete has been stripped of so many medals.
Tikhon lost his 2005 world championship title nine years later after he was found to be doping with testosterone.
The 40-year-old also lost his Olympic silver medal in 2004 because of steroid doping and his European Championship title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
His bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also disallowed, was returned to him due to a ruling by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
With 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite only tested positive in May but is still allowed to compete in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found to have taken a banned food supplement, but her ban by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, on Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She had planned to return home at the beginning of September.
It is still unclear whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more bombs went off, killing another person, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong, a popular beach for holidaymakers.
Another bomb then exploded in Surat Thani on the country's southeast coast, killing a municipal employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive device went off in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast left several people injured.
A connection with the explosions in Hua Hin was assumed, they said.
"The bombings have the same signature," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
He said it was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was likely the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern in the attacks that is typical for bomb attacks by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage confined to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, he said, it was assumed that the bombs were planted by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities had received intelligence tips about imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officers across the country to tighten security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always minor bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities at all costs.
A high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.
Following clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, non-essential travel to these provinces is discouraged.
An increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The constitution grants the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economy and tourism.
The militaryunta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, credits itself with restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
However, even the military has not managed to get a grip on the Muslim rebel insurgency that has been smouldering for years in the extreme south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people - most of them foreign tourists - were killed in an attack at a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has become the target of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the federal constitutional protectors have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist manner.
That is why we are now also monitoring the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multiculturalism," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through foreign infiltration."
The "Identitarians" are already being observed by constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia.
Maaßen said his agency had closely coordinated with the state offices in making the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' try to pick up their target group where they stand," said the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
In general, extremists try to address them with language suitable for young people, often with pop music.
Islamists do this just as much as right-wing extremists.
This is not a pious advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly susceptible to this.
That is dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the "Identitarians" and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant after a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction through certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not discernible.
With regard to the significant increase in right-wing motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have established in recent years that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups will form, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks with other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognisable.
So far, the groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were the work of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes who previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or who, for example, voted for the CDU, SPD or left-wing parties, but who then became radicalised by right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
It is not always the Olympians or world records that dominate the headlines at the Olympic Games.
Robel Kiros Habte's courageous performance at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro shows that.
In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how wide the crop was selected.
Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit on social networks.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished 48 seconds behind in his preliminary heat and came 59th out of 59 starters.
However, it was rather his less than athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old is nevertheless taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given special starting rights by the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to raise the profile of swimming in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media referred to him as "Robel the Whale."
In reference to a "prosperity belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he only clocked one minute and almost five seconds in the 100-metre freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
The swimmer from Equatorial Guinea's performance was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a preliminary heat of the 100-metre freestyle.
Moussambani was cheered on frenetically at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
Geretsried - The owner of a shop on Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old woman from Geretsried had left her shop at around 5.30 pm on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the till.
No traces of the perpetrator could be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see impending election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If he does not win the US presidential election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He will go on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would be relatively indifferent: "At the end of the day, it's either going to work out or I'm going to have a very, very nice, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it wasn't enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that was fine, Trump said.
For example, he referred to US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
More and more resistance has been forming within his party recently.
German Post enters the electric van business
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
Other companies are apparently showing great interest in the vehicle.
Deutsche Post is planning to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
The company wants to start trading with the transporter soon.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the open car market as of next year.
"We want to get into sales to third parties," a Post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been considering for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which is used to deliver letters and parcels, to other businesses.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated requests, for example from tradesmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the Bonn-based company plans to start mass production of the vehicles soon.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in its own factory.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and was aiming for a complete switch to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will convert the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management steps down after disappointing business figures
Consumer research company GfK is replacing its chief executive Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK foreshadowed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann would become all the more precarious the longer the successes he had promised would fail to materialise.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After another disappointing set of business figures and the resignation of the company's management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new start in terms of personnel.
GfK's CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the supervisory body with effect from 12 September.
Gerhard Hausruckinger, the current member of the Management Board, will take over the leadership of the Management Board already as of 1 September, the company announced.
He is to officially assume the function of "spokesperson of the Executive Board" until a successor for Hartmann has been found.
The company cited "differing views" on long-term business policy orientation as the reason for the resignations.
A company spokesperson did not want to give details on Friday.
It is currently unclear who will lead the market research company in the future.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that there had recently been great disappointment among shareholders over the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the helm of GfK since 2011.
"However, the fruits of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of GfK's recent poor business figures, any shareholder would become restless at some point.
"If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss-making journey in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, turnover shrank by 3.4 per cent to 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter was primarily burdened by the decreased value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience division gave the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros on the bottom line.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides into ditch in Krummhörn: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident involving a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers in Krummhörn (Aurich district) on Thursday.
Two of the passengers suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a tour company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, which was partly driving on the opposite lane.
The bus went off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Due to the position of the bus, the persons could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an emergency ambulance came to the scene of the accident on state road 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a public bus.
There they were to wait for a replacement bus from the tour company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
As of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater will be 3.44 euros instead of the previous 2.10 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater plant area; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
For the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest when corresponding improvement measures become necessary.
According to a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, it was determined during the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach District Office that under-recoveries were accruing for these wastewater facilities.
The market town of Kasendorf is obliged by law to operate the facilities in a way that covers the costs.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their wallets.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As head of administration Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the market community's wastewater facilities.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-recoveries from the previous calculation period had to be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater volume of between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros, for example, would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, all three plants had incurred considerable renovation and repair costs in the past calculation period, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf wastewater plant the mechanical aeration system had to be replaced due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be overhauled from the ground up, and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "In addition to these extraordinary expenses, there were the updated care and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that with the low volume of waste water in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "have a full impact."
Schmidt added that the market community had been spared major maintenance costs for the wastewater plants in the past 20 years.
In Steinhäuser's opinion, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these facilities because they are loss-making.
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has died himself in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets," a civil defence group that has saved the lives of almost 60,000 people so far, according to the Bild newspaper.
2900 volunteers put their own lives on the line to pull people out of bombed-out houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian contactor showing him rescuing an infant from the rubble of a house for 11 hours went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
However, he never saw himself as a hero, saying according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
Helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people are suffering from respiratory problems.
"We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," Bild quoted his last words as saying before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had been meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination aboard the research vessel Sanna.
It was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic at a good 1 km/h - until today.
Greenland sharks do not have offspring until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, travelling an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.
Only when it counts does the five-metre-long animal accelerate to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle characterised by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
In any case, Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insane," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks live to a ripe old age.
But the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe; after all, they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear at the surface in winter.
Researchers know correspondingly little about the Greenland sharks' lifestyle.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they fitted six animals with a transmitter off Spitsbergen.
Nevertheless, these sharks do prey: in the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the Arctic Ocean looking for carcasses that stagger down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen took as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic off Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.
To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is formed before the sharks are born, and the proteins it contains are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a conspicuous amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests ejected large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In contrast, in the third smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it may have been celebrating its 50th birthday when it was studied in 2012.
In contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark, while the record-breaking shark, at 502 centimetres, may even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only have offspring when they are longer than four metres.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals, at 392 centimetres, was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined to be 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously take at least one and a half centuries to reproduce.
That, too, is probably a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusalems live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old bowhead whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck in the blubber on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a low flame.
They mature later - and age more slowly.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals also often grow particularly large.
This is because the volume grows much faster than its surface area, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in a double pack
At its most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on building issues.
The council was relieved to hear from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential building sites can begin."
Now that the land, parcelling and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying have been submitted, there is nothing standing in the way of selling the plots in the residential development areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - development phase 1) to interested parties.
The local council is convinced that the building plots in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and sprightly senior citizens.
It was announced that those interested in building can now register at the town hall, and the council is expected to discuss the allocation of plots at its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet requests for the establishment of additional businesses and the creation of new jobs, the council decided to amend some parts of the new land use plan that was only drawn up in the spring of this year.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated commercial area will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
According to the report, the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue conducting financial business from London throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, it has so far been sufficient for them to be licensed in the UK.
Large US banks are taking advantage of this.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Council (ESRB) speak in favour of Frankfurt.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but performs worse in terms of infrastructure, as does Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to its large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial real estate.
"In Paris, it is not at all easy to find vacant high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial property are 50 per cent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by the management consultancy Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th, Dublin in 33rd and Paris in 37th.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, according to the economic researchers.
The balance of power also speaks for this: According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared to 6,500 in Frankfurt.
City council decides unanimously: No new kiosk to be built on the banks of the Rhine in St. Goar.
Normally, the people of St. Goar accept investment projects from traders with a warm hand - after all, the retail trade in the town centre is considered to be in need of expansion.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony, which is currently under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath on behalf of the CDU parliamentary group.
Witnesses wanted: Drinks market robbed in Waldbröl
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market in Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
At gunpoint, three darkly dressed persons with masked faces demanded cash from the beverage store employee and then fled on foot and presumably in a silver-coloured VW Golf.
The police did not say how much money was taken.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel car park opposite the parking garage entrance in a silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of the B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who observed anything in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (around 7.45 p.m.) should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: Fun and games at a summer camp
The children and youths of the socio-educational day group/social group work of the Child Protection Association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers at their summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
During the first week of the school holidays, the lively group was accommodated in the Hardtwäldle leisure centre in a quiet location.
Several full-day excursions were on the programme.
One was to Bretten and a visit to the petting zoo.
The second was to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour for children in the world-famous monastery.
The third excursion was to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and splash around.
Culinary delights were served to children and carers with their own favourite dishes such as Sauren Spätzle, Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, they made batik, created beautiful pieces of jewellery out of beads and stones or made a Roman mill game out of wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings around the fire and the final "colourful evening."
On the day of the journey home, the sun was shining and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Door of Mercy
The altar boys from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna pastoral unit were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together they completed four stages.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all altar boys in probably two years' time, the senior altar boy group of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a pilgrimage hike lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided to go to the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Gate of Mercy at Freiburg Cathedral, which was opened for this purpose.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern made the journey.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and gave the pilgrim's blessing.
From Horb, they travelled by train to the starting point in Villingen, where there is also a Minster of Our Lady, and so began the pilgrimage route from the Minster.
The individual daily tours were each framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptural texts.
On the way, the minis stopped at crosses, chapels and churches to sing a song from a specially compiled pilgrimage songbook.
Parish homes of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and fortifying evening meal and breakfast.
On the second day, they continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day, they started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of the way, as they first had to descend and then climb about 500 metres of altitude in the sweltering heat.
The well-deserved reward was a barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.
After the morning prayer on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, they set off on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg Cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the Door of Mercy.
They gave thanks to God with a short impulse.
At the evening mass in the cathedral, the minis who had arrived at their pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon, they returned to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are on the horizon for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This is the result of representative polls conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black governing coalition could narrowly continue to govern in the north, this is not possible in Berlin according to the poll results.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to provide the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 per cent five years ago to 24 per cent.
According to the poll, the party would thus be only just ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23 per cent.
Third place is disputed between the Left Party and the AfD.
The Left would get 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), while the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 per cent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens would re-enter the Schwerin Landtag with 6 per cent (previously 8.7 per cent).
With 3 per cent each, the NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the Landtag.
According to the survey, the SPD would only achieve 23 per cent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (election 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU would only achieve 18 per cent after 23.4 per cent.
It would thus still be behind the Greens with 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 per cent), but ahead of the Left with 15 per cent (previously 11.7 per cent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 per cent.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the Pirates, in contrast to 2011, would miss out on entry.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
Its successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't feel good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" hit the shops exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, enthusiasts can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow date from the stone age of the internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in waistcoat pocket format."
Indeed, the new mobile phone could do a lot by the standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, the Communicator could also be reached by fax.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonisingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened up much like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-marks, or about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and wound up.
Today, the market is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is part of everyday life for many people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are doing well.
An entire industry has grown up around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market did not come until the beginning of 2007, when Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator, all easy to operate by touch screen.
Apple's triumphal procession began, and even today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were left behind.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry is struggling.
Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung are now calling the shots.
The smartphone is taken for granted 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his or her mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone down sometimes," said Janina Kugel, the Siemens board member responsible for human resources.
Permanent accessibility is now seen as both a curse and a blessing.
A controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodriguez's tears ran from base to base faster than the US baseball star in his best days.
After his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team," he said.
"I say 'goodbye' to both," the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star Game participant declared.
Three times Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signing of a ten-year contract has brought him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he created some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar stats in the most important statistics.
But the 41-year-old is still unlikely to be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame.
For as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, his appearance off the field is controversial.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to his involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect in receiving performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-ageing clinic in South Florida.
After a legal battle, the suspension was still reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might have even done me a favour for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said smugly at the time.
His farewell days are not going quietly either.
While many baseball legends get the big stage one more time in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour," he said.
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi caughed.
At least Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is rumoured to be in relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received expressions of sympathy from fans of the Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters chanted in a 9-4 loss to Rodriguez's team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Busted: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
One caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have come to light at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, the 3000-metre hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and were excluded - just before the start of the already critically scrutinised athletics competitions, this news comes at an inopportune time.
Chen had already tested positive for the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) confirmed her exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the 100m butterfly final, missing out on the bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen was supposed to have taken part in the heats of the 50m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and hold a hearing.
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigation," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, CAS rather than the IOC is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night in Rio, news of Danekova's positive sample leaked out, with the 33-year-old going on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an unbelievable shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping substance EPO.
Danekova has been suspended for the time being, and according to BNT, the B sample has already turned out positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation will not be allowed to compete in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" also became known. Like his brother Tomasz, the London Olympic champion in the 85 kg category tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier.
Both deny taking the drug, but both are not allowed to compete in the 94 kg category.
Before the start of the track and field athletes, the Danekova case in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned all but one of the Russian team from competing because of systematic doping, and Kenya, the nation of runners, is also producing a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the earlier offences in China had also caused heated arguments between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt, for example, harshly attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pees purple," he said.
"When I see the podium in the 200m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an altercation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping cheats," the latter said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month ban.
Data theft: Hackers extort their ransom in this perfidious way
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany by the malware defence specialists Malwarebytes, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been the victim of an attack with extortion software at least once, sometimes several times, in the past twelve months.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies have already been the target of a ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to Malwarebytes' observations, the perpetrators are increasingly specialising their extortion software in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with Die Welt.
In 2008, most malware programmes were still designed to send out advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has been frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.
The ransomware encrypts these files and permanently deletes the originals.
The software then presents the blackmailers' demands.
To get the final key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users' personal photo databases are at stake, companies' sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production comes to a standstill, are at stake.
The damage is correspondingly higher when ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported turnover losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business activities, and in one case people's lives were in danger.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you're only furthering the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 per cent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to refuse the perpetrators' demands in view of the standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers from F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortionists and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to collect more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that three or four people are involved.
The programmers then sell their malware to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software kit.
Previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Included in the kit is a customisation tool so that minor configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then seek out other hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log on to one of the underground forums, buy the kit from one criminal and hire another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then hire spammers to distribute it," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies, which are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that they can ward off ransomware by means of file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat for successful erpessing, the perpetrators are instead threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes head Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is many times higher than before, depending on the type of data.
The perpetrators could also target completely new targets on the Internet of Things in the future.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet.
In the middle of winter, unlocking such a blocked heating system could well be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating system, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear; it doesn't feel cramped at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-made and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top falls a little short.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable cars when it comes to storage space.
Not only is there a boot of 453 litres with the backrests up and 1026 litres with them folded down, but there are the "Magic Seats."
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear seats fold up like cinema seats to provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from floor to ceiling.
The boot is easy to load, although the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, it could do its job a little more quietly.
The everyday fuel consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering could be a little more direct.
The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" leaves nothing to be desired.
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning system is sometimes irritating because it assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and reduces the speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to reach.
The price of around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is acceptable.
If you don't want to invest that much, the petrol engine is available from 20000 Euros, the diesel from 23000 Euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile car that is suitable for everyday use.
Airline not liable: Fall on passenger boarding bridge
An airline is not liable for a passenger falling on a jetway.
This is because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical for air traffic, argued the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Ref.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken his kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Sickness: When does the organiser pay?
Holidaymakers who fall ill can only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly to be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been proven to have the same symptoms.
In the case under discussion, a family had fallen seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.
They spent almost the entire holiday in their room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family was of the opinion that the trip had thus been defective - and sued the organiser.
The plaintiffs were not successful in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organiser only found out about it shortly before the plaintiffs' departure.
Until then, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was in order.
Therefore, he had not violated his duty to inform, according to the ruling.
Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection among themselves - was part of the general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 had fallen ill.
De Maizière said that after the violent attacks committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react prudently and resolutely to terrorist threats at the same time.
One thing is certain: our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow the terrorists this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, that would increase security and also strengthen the population's support for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further increase in personnel for the security forces, "in the mid-four-digit range over several years."
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism should again be punishable.
Video surveillance is to be improved and the weapons law is to be amended in such a way as to make it more difficult to buy weapons on the internet.
According to de Maizière, the recently much-discussed doctor-patient confidentiality should be preserved.
However, he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession on how to reduce the danger to citizens, he said, for example with regard to mental abnormalities.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the minister believes that better social support is necessary.
Teachers must be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
In order to pursue criminals in special areas of the internet (darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
He said it was important that the interior minister had spoken out clearly against actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for the agitators in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the CDU/CSU for a ban on the burqa and the abolition of dual citizenship.
In his view, a general ban on full-face veils would be problematic from a constitutional point of view.
You cannot ban everything that you reject, and I reject the wearing of the burqa.
He said that one could talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Simone Peter, leader of the Green Party, accused the minister of trying to simulate energy and the ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Bernd Riexinger, leader of the Left Party, said: "Slogans and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country.
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder road
Traffic regularly backs up on the bypass - here is a picture from November.
But that is to change: The right-turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in traffic jams every evening during rush hour on the surrounding road when they drive via the motorway feeder road (A 43).
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the Landesbetrieb Straßenbau will extend the right-turn lane by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers will then be able to turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea for the extended exit came from the CDU parliamentary group in the Münster-West district council.
The narrowing of the lane on the feeder road is particularly annoying for drivers between 5 and 7 pm.
On weekdays, the tailback reaches as far as the bridge over Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 shortly before the Weseler Straße exit.
From here on, traffic is only directed across the motorway bridge in one lane.
The second lane had to be removed a good three-quarters of a year ago.
The reason: structural calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate two lanes of heavy goods traffic in particular.
The responsible state authority cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated weekday traffic jam will last.
However, years are to be expected: The bridge has an official remaining useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-turn lane, the state agency deliberately chose the off-peak period during the school holidays because obstructions are to be expected.
Traffic will be routed past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: Cultural activities for schools
The international class of the Waldschule visited the play "The Invisible House."
The Nima's association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "International Class" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" by the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and fifteen visited the production in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among other countries, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, it was nevertheless possible for them to follow the plot, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are being planned.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for improvement in the weather
The weather threw a spanner in the works for shooting star gazers in southwestern Germany on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning that the night had been badly suited for observing the celestial spectacle because of clouds and rain.
Our hope lies in the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will surely see many shooting stars in the sky.
The shooting stars are the Perseids, which at 216,000 kilometres per hour are among the fastest shooting stars.
They get their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: Tips against insomnia
In the evening you toss and turn, at night you lie awake for hours, and in the morning you can't even think about sleeping before the alarm clock rings.
This is anything but restful.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of all adults have sleep problems, and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently unrestorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood, however, is insomnia, i.e. a disorder of falling asleep or sleeping through the night.
Many people find sleeping through the night unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Association of Family Doctors with a practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
They can be caused by organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also by medication.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another illness.
"Waking up very early is especially common with depression," says Weeß.
And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.
For example, if you have a slipped disc, it is difficult to lie down, you wake up every two to three hours and possibly start brooding about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I see a doctor if I have insomnia?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is impaired during the day should see a doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: One is fatigued, tired, unrested, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach aches or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep physicians in private practice in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Weeß advises that people with sleep problems should first consult their family doctor.
He or she can check whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
Doctors recommend an examination in the sleep laboratory for snoring with breathing pauses, pathological daytime sleepiness, sleepwalkers or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be found, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the examination.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't take a nap at noon," says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on your body, you wear nasal cannulae, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?
There are quite a few things you can do to improve your sleep.
Weeß lists them: Regular bedtimes and wake-up times, not lying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - because then you immediately start calculating, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler commented on Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the Short Course World Championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Now, former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his criticised former teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a €20,000 bonus and a jungle king gets €150,000, no one should be surprised about the lack of medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We can't compete with countries that promote a lot and don't look too closely at the issue of doping or even do it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he explained further.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to the German National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) nine months before his first start.
This is exactly how it should be done with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be checked by independent inspectors from WADA/FINA a certain time before the World Championships/OS should not be allowed to take part," demands the Hamburg native by choice, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30 p.m., civilian officers in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July this year and had acted jointly, with a division of labour and in a particularly professional manner.
The specialists of Criminal Investigation Department 34 were able to prove that the thieves, who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes, had committed four offences.
They stole a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, a few cobblestones in between: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it as one of the city's "dangerous places."
If you walk along the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food shop.
Someone has sprayed "ugly!" on the façade of a grey house.
Across from a Lidl, which is also soon to be demolished, construction is already underway: A house with high windows and 133 new rental flats is to be built here by 2017.
In recent weeks, however, articles about this "trendy district," as the real estate company responsible calls Friedrichshain, have preferred to be illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, in the meantime the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's Interior Senator Henkel in particular had repeatedly spoken out in favour of a police crackdown on the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After clearing the ground floor premises, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on 22 June, police patrolled the site for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three squad cars, according to official statements, blocking off parts of the street and preventing visitors from entering the house at number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left to the cheers of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents are walking with children, people are sitting on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting in front of the Späti.
A primary school and kindergartens are in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
They share concerns about rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.
It doesn't sound like a neighbourhood where the majority wanted police protection from vandalising leftists.
The rift that Berlin's interior senator and the police are creating between squatters and their neighbours obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which even today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Squatting and the housing projects born out of it have also been part of the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were squatted, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to Rigaer.
While the Mainzer was cleared in a veritable street battle with a large police presence, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalised and are partly still inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world in recent years: Residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent for new leases since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: You can recognise them by broken windows or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year together with the words "left-wing autonomous violence."
One reason that not all neighbours see it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: According to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are damage to property, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses more.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in an apartment building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there is no question of insecurity.
As far as acts of violence are concerned, she is placating: the people in 94 are her neighbours, they certainly didn't do it.
And the famous burning cars on Rigaer have not happened for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal hotspot, on the contrary: "Here people help each other, live together on the street and get to know more about each other than elsewhere.
Neugebauer deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: From the police, the politicians and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed interpretive sovereignty over the neighbourhood in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: By faceless new buildings in former gaps between buildings that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-off tend to live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."
But what are you supposed to do if no one ever listens to you?
That's when frustration sets in on all sides, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are angry about paint bombs: "The house projects and the left-wing scene are part of the neighbourhood.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a bar district can hardly complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organiser.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.
The social worker supports the administration team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the refugee aid working group, the administration, the authorities and anyone else who is involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying lizard who has one problem above all.
This is what some had meant - not so much mocking as referring to the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
They were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, in other words, an eierlegende Wollmilchsau.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organisation, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes, as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been with the organisation for about six weeks.
She has a 50 per cent position limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supported voluntary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in Wasenstraße
For some time now, one serious problem has been finding flats for the refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the follow-up accommodation.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs for building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility shifts from the district administration to the municipality and the job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his flat.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration cannot find any private flats.
It has not worked so far, although one is dependent on private flats, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal flats have to be upgraded, as the saying goes.
So, new containers will soon be put up in Wasenstraße.
But housing alone is not enough.
Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree that perspective is the key.
Besides a permanent place to stay, it is internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do community service - and do it motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.
This is "not occupational therapy."
But activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Kunde.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So they need things like sports, contact with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, the administration and volunteers step in.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can usefully bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they cannot help anyone in Urbach, are not allowed to work and are useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority are motivated.
But there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people who can't do anything. Deuschle and Kunde's work therefore always includes motivating others.
All this is a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "which some might call naïve." But she cannot and does not want to rule out a residual risk.
But the helpers are already sensitised.
These incidents are also a topic of discussion among the refugees.
They are afraid that the attackers will discredit them completely.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So main and voluntary workers have to look for activities locally and in the region.
They always have in mind that a new wave of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politicians are afraid to answer this question clearly.
Actually, it is unfair to ask it of helpers on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the people of Urbach are also already busy trying to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglar sought by helicopter
The police helicopter flew over different areas for about an hour - without success.
Two unknown men forced their way into a flat in an apartment building in Lindenweg at around 8.50 on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and beat the fiends into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled in the direction of the city centre.
Several police patrols and a police helicopter were deployed to search the area.
The search was unsuccessful.
It is possible that the unknown persons attracted attention near the flat before the crime or during their escape.
Baden-Wuerttemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack bar
After an attack on a snack bar in Ulm, police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious breach of the peace.
During flat searches, evidence and drugs were seized, the police announced on Friday.
According to the police, about 20 masked men from a rocker-like group threw bottles and stones against the window of a snack bar in July.
Afterwards, they allegedly attacked two customers and slightly injured one.
Afterwards they fled.
The snack bar and the adjacent building were damaged to the tune of 10,000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in the Ulm biker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
Thuringia: Zeiss Meditec closer to one billion euros in turnover
High demand for medical technology in Asia has boosted Carl Zeiss Meditec's turnover.
In the first nine months of the fiscal year, which began in October, group sales rose by 6.7 per cent to €798.6 million, as the listed company announced in Jena on Friday.
The Asian business grew disproportionately by 17.1 per cent.
Earnings before interest and taxes increased from 89.5 million euros to 110.5 million euros, according to the interim financial statement.
The Jena-based medical technology group aims to exceed the one billion euro sales mark this financial year, the management board affirmed.
Zeiss Meditec manufactures devices and equipment for medical practices and clinics.
The company, which belongs to the optics and electronics group Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen), employs just under 3000 people.
